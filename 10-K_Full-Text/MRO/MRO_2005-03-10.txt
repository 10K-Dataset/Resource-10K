PART I

Item 1. and 2. Business and Properties

General

Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a
result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a
subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the "Separation"), USX Corporation
changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

Before
December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our
energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock ("Steel Stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, Marathon disposed
of its steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation ("United States Steel") to holders of Steel Stock
in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In
connection with the Separation, Marathon's certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and, from that date, Marathon has only one class of common stock
authorized.

Our
principal operating subsidiaries are Marathon Oil Company and Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP"). Marathon Oil Company and its predecessors have been engaged in the oil and gas
business since 1887. MAP is 62-percent owned by Marathon and 38-percent owned by Ashland Inc. ("Ashland").

Segment and Geographic Information

Our operations consist of three operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production ("E&P") – explores for and produces
crude oil and natural gas; 2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation ("RM&T") – refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products; and 3) Integrated Gas
("IG") – markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and methanol. For operating segment and geographic
information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-19.

Exploration and Production

We are currently conducting exploration, development and production activities in nine countries. Principal exploration activities are in the
United States, Norway, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Canada. Principal development and production activities are in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and
Russia. We are also pursuing opportunities in north and west Africa and the Middle East.


Our
2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 170,000 barrels per day ("bpd"), a decrease of 12 percent from 2003 levels. Our 2004 worldwide sales of natural gas
production, including gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 999 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd"), a decrease of 15 percent compared to 2003. In total, our 2004
worldwide production averaged 337,000 barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") per day, compared to 389,000 boe per day in 2003. (For purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are converted to
approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet ("mcf ") by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of gas
volume to obtain boe.) In 2005, our worldwide production is expected to average approximately 325,000 to 350,000 boe per day, excluding acquisitions and dispositions.

The
above projection of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production volumes is a forward-looking statement. Some factors that could potentially affect timing and levels
of production include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature fields,
timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, future acquisitions or dispositions of producing properties, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or
terrorist acts and the government or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statement.

Exploration

In the United States during 2004, we drilled 35 gross (17 net) exploratory wells of which 22 gross (10 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 22 wells, 3
gross (1 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing. Internationally, we drilled 21 gross (16 net) exploratory wells of which 13 gross (10 net) wells encountered
hydrocarbons. Of these 13 wells, 13 gross (9 net) wells were temporarily suspended or are in the process of completing.

United States

–  The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area for us with the potential to add new
reserves. At the end of 2004, we had interests in 123 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, including 94 in the deepwater area.

During
2004, we announced that the Neptune 7 appraisal well on the Neptune Unit in the Gulf of Mexico encountered hydrocarbons. This discovery follows the Neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and
the Neptune 5 discovery
in 2003. Two successful appraisal sidetrack wells also were drilled from the original Neptune 5 location. Front end engineering and design for a Neptune development is currently underway. We hold a
30 percent interest in the Neptune Unit.

Announced
in 2003, the Perseus discovery is located on Viosca Knoll Block 830 in the Gulf of Mexico approximately five miles from the existing Petronius platform. The Perseus discovery
was expected to begin production in 2004 via an extended-reach well drilled from the Petronius platform. Due to hurricane activity in September 2004 and the resulting damage to the Petronius
platform, production from Perseus has been delayed until repairs of the Petronius platform can be completed. We hold a 50 percent interest in the Perseus discovery.

In
2001 a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona prospect in the Gulf of Mexico and in 2002 two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was successful. We have established
an integrated project team to formulate a development plan. We are currently negotiating commercial terms of a production handling agreement with a nearby operator. We are also in the process of
reviewing seismic data to obtain a better understanding of the complex salt formations in the area and to optimize the location of the next well. We hold a 68 percent interest in the Ozona
prospect.

Other
United States exploration activity during 2004 included three wells in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska, two of which were discoveries, and 11 wells in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma,
nine of which were discoveries.

Norway

–  During 2004 we announced the Hamsun discovery. The well is located on production license (PL)
150, which is approximately 136 miles from Stavanger, Norway, and approximately six miles south of the Alvheim area. The discovery well and three sidetracks encountered oil and gas. Results are being
analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the Alvheim development. We are the operator of PL150, owning a 65 percent interest. The
Hamsun well builds on our successful 2003 Norwegian drilling program, which resulted in three discoveries, the Kneler and Boa discoveries in the Alvheim development and the Vilje (formerly known as
Klegg) discovery. In December 2004 we acquired four new Norwegian exploration licenses, three of which we are designated as operator.

Angola

–  Offshore Angola, we own a 10 percent interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent
interest in Block 32. During 2004, we participated in the Venus-1 well, the fourth oil discovery on Block 31. The Venus well is located near the


Plutao,
Saturno and Marte discoveries in the northeast portion of Block 31. These discoveries are the basis for a planned development of the northeast area of Block 31. Development options are
currently being evaluated.

During
late 2004, we participated in a well on the Palas prospect in the southern portion of Block 31, and in early 2005, it was announced as a discovery. Also, at the end of 2004,
operations were ongoing at the Ceres prospect, located in the central portion of Block 31.

During
2004, we announced the Canela discovery on Block 32, located about 10 miles south of the 2003 Gindungo discovery. Also in 2004, wells on the Cola and Gengibre prospects, both on
Block 32, reached total depth. The Cola well encountered hydrocarbons, but additional drilling will be required to determine commerciality. The results of the Gengibre well will be announced following
government approval.

Equatorial Guinea

–  During 2004, we participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on the
Alba Block offshore Equatorial Guinea. The Deep Luba discovery well, drilled from the Alba field production platform, encountered gas and condensate in several pay zones. The Gardenia discovery well
is located approximately 11 miles southwest of the Alba Field. We are currently evaluating development scenarios for both the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries. These discoveries reinforce the
potential of the Alba Block, in which we own a 63 percent interest.

In
2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on Block D offshore Equatorial Guinea, where we are the operator with a 90 percent interest. The discovery well is on the Bococo
prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the Alba field. The well has been suspended for reentry at a later date. Development scenarios for the Bococo gas discovery along with three earlier
dry gas discoveries on Block D are being considered for further development.

Canada

–  In 2002, we announced a gas discovery at the Annapolis G-24 deepwater wildcat
well approximately 215 miles south of Halifax, Nova Scotia in 5,504 feet of water. The G-24 encountered gas pay over several zones. The Crimson well, six miles southeast of the Annapolis
discovery, was drilled in 2004 and was plugged and abandoned. We are the operator and own a 30 percent interest in the Annapolis lease. In addition, we operate the adjacent Cortland lease where
we own a 75 interest and the adjacent Empire lease where we own a 50 percent interest.

Production (including development activities)

United States

–  Approximately 48 percent of our 2004 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production
and 63 percent of our worldwide natural gas production was produced from U.S. operations.

During
2004, our production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 35,700 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing 44 percent of our total U.S. liquid hydrocarbon production, and
100 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 16 percent of our total U.S. natural gas production. Liquid hydrocarbon production decreased by 17,800 net bpd and natural gas production decreased
by 36 net mmcfd from the prior year. The decrease in production is mainly due to natural field declines and the effects of hurricane activity. Our Petronius platform suffered significant damage from
Hurricane Ivan and was out of service part of September and the entire fourth quarter of 2004. Repair activity is underway, but production of liquid hydrocarbons of approximately 19,000 net bpd and
natural gas of approximately 32 net mmcfd remains shut in. Production is not expected to come back on stream until the second quarter of 2005. At year-end 2004, we held interests in eight
producing fields and 11 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, of which seven platforms are operated by Marathon.

Our
natural gas production from Alaska is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarter. In 2004 our Alaskan
natural gas production averaged 174 net mmcfd, representing 28 percent of our total U.S. gas production. The increase from 2003 production of 166 net mmcfd is primarily due to a full year of
production from the Ninilchik field. Production from the Ninilchik field began in 2003 and development continues on the field. Ninilchik gas is transported through the 32-mile portion of
the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline, which connects Ninilchik to the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility and industrial markets on the Kenai
Peninsula, in Anchorage and in other parts of south central Alaska. We operate the Ninilchik Unit and own a 60 percent interest in it and the Kenai Kachemak Pipeline.

Liquid
hydrocarbon production from our Wyoming fields averaged 21,200 net bpd in 2004 compared to 21,400 net bpd in 2003. Gas production from our Wyoming fields averaged 108 net mmcfd in
2004 compared to 127 net mmcfd in 2003. The decrease in our Wyoming gas production is primarily attributed to lower production from the Powder River Basin, which averaged 69 net mmcfd in 2004 compared
to 82 net mmcfd in 2003. This decrease is primarily attributed to natural field decline. Development of the Powder River Basin continued in 2004 with approximately 230 wells drilled, of which 145 are
yet to be completed, compared to approximately 320 wells drilled in 2003. Additional development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2004 where we participated in the drilling of 18 wells.
Gas production from our Oklahoma fields averaged 82 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 96 net mmcfd in 2003. This


decrease
is primarily attributed to natural field decline. Our 2004 development program continued to focus in the Anadarko Basin where we participated in the drilling of 53 wells.

Our
share of liquid hydrocarbon production from the Permian Basin region, which extends from southeast New Mexico to west Texas averaged 18,900 bpd in 2004, compared to 30,200 bpd in
2003. This decrease is principally due to natural field decline and the sale of the Yates field in November 2003. Gas production from our New Mexico fields, primarily the Indian Basin field,
averaged 85 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 122 net mmcfd in 2003. The decrease in natural gas production is due to natural field decline. Gas production from our Texas fields, primarily located in East
Texas, averaged 65 net mmcfd in 2004 compared to 73 net mmcfd in 2003. This decrease is mostly due to natural field decline. Active development of the Mimms Creek field in East Texas continued in 2004
with the drilling of 26 wells.

United Kingdom

–  Our largest asset in the U.K. North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the
operator and own a 42 percent interest in the South, Central, North, and West Brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the
underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central Brae field and West Brae/Sedgwick fields. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field are
gas-condensate fields. Our share of production from the Brae area averaged 15,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 17,500 bpd in 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from
natural field decline. Our share of Brae gas sales averaged 197 mmcfd in 2004 compared with 198 mmcfd in 2003.

The
strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, there
are 22 agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on
Brae-area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.

The
Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation ("SAGE") system. The Beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. The SAGE
pipeline transports gas from the Brae and Beryl areas and has a total wet gas capacity of approximately 1,000 mmcfd. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes gas from the SAGE
pipeline and 0.8 billion cubic feet ("bcf") per day of third party gas from the Britannia field.

In
the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own an approximately 30 percent interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main
Foinaven field, 47 percent of East Foinaven and 20 percent of the T35 and T25 accumulations, each of which has a single well. Our share of production from the Foinaven fields averaged
21,900 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 10 mmcfd of natural gas in 2004, compared to 22,400 net bpd and 10 mmcfd in 2003.

Norway

–  We are the operator and own a 65 percent interest in the Alvheim complex located on
the Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development is comprised of the Kneler and Boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped Kameleon accumulation. During 2004, we received approval from the
Norwegian authorities for our Alvheim plan of development and operation ("PDO"), which will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel ("FPSO") with subsea infrastructure for five
drill centers and associated flow lines. The PDO also outlines transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and transportation of produced natural gas to the SAGE system using a new
14-inch, 24-mile cross border pipeline. Marathon and its Alvheim project partners signed a purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the Odin multipurpose shuttle tanker, which
will be modified to an FPSO. Also during 2004, the Alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, subject to the
approval of the Vilje PDO which was submitted to the Norwegian government in December 2004. Production from a combined Alvheim/Vilje development is expected to reach more than 50,000 net boe
per day with first production starting in 2007.

During
2004, production in Norway from the Heimdal, Vale and Byggve/Skirne fields averaged 2,000 net bpd and 27 net mmcfd. We own a 24 percent interest in the Heimdal field, a
47 percent interest in the Vale field and a 20 percent interest in the Byggve/Skirne field, which came on stream during 2004.

Ireland

–  We own a 100 percent interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale
fields in the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. Natural gas sales were 58 mmcfd in 2004, compared with 62 mmcfd in 2003. We have agreed with the Seven Heads group to process and transport gas, as well as
to provide field operating services, through our existing Kinsale Head facilities. Production from Seven Heads commenced in December 2003.

We
own an 18.5 percent interest in the Corrib gas development project, located approximately 40 miles off Ireland's west coast. During 2004, the An Bord Pleanála
upheld the Mayo County Council's decision to grant planning approval for the proposed natural gas terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge, County Mayo, which will process gas from the


Corrib
field. This decision represents a major step forward for the outside-operated Corrib gas project. Development work on the Corrib project has resumed and first gas production is expected in
mid-year 2007.

Equatorial Guinea

–  We own a 63 percent interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea
and a 52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant held through an equity method investee. During 2004 liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 18,900 bpd and
natural gas production averaged 76 mmcfd, compared to 12,400 bpd and 66 mmcfd in 2003. The condensate expansion project was completed during 2004 and began its production ramp up. This expansion
project is expected to increase total liquids production from approximately 20,000 gross bpd to approximately 57,000 gross bpd (32,000 bpd net to Marathon). By the end of 2004 liquids production had
increased to approximately 45,800 gross bpd. The liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") expansion project progressed during 2004 and is expected to
start-up in the second quarter of 2005. When completed, gross liquids production is expected to increase from approximately 57,000 gross bpd to 79,000 gross bpd (44,500 bpd net to
Marathon).

Approximately
125 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the condensate and LPG are removed is supplied to Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC ("AMPCO") where it is used to manufacture
methanol. We own 45 percent of AMPCO, which is reported in the Integrated Gas segment. Remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for later production when
the LNG project on Bioko Island is completed.

Gabon

–  We are the operator of the Tchatamba South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore
Gabon with a 56 percent working interest. Production in Gabon averaged 13,600 net bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2004, compared with 14,700 net bpd in 2003. Production from these three fields is
processed on a single facility at Tchatamba Marin, with processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore pipeline to a non-operated storage facility. During 2004, we
extended our license in Gabon for 10 years which will now expire in 2018.

Russia

–  During 2003 we acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation ("KMOC"). KMOC's fields are located
in the Khanty Mansiysk region of western Siberia. Production from these assets averaged 16,600 net bpd during 2004, primarily from the Potanay and East Kamennoye fields. Development activities
continued in these fields in 2004, with 35 wells drilled in East Kamennoye and 17 wells drilled in Potanay. Additionally, one well was drilled in 2004 on the Paitykhskoye license.

Libya

–  We own a 16.3 percent interest in the approximately 13 million acre Waha
concession in Libya. In 1986, we ceased active participation in the concessions following the imposition of trade sanctions by the U.S. government. In 2004 the U.S. government lifted the sanctions,
allowing us to advance plans to return to production operations. We continue to work with our partners, including the Libyan government, to finalize the terms of a reentry agreement.

Gas-to-liquids

–  During 2004, Marathon and Syntroleum Corporation
("Syntroleum") successfully completed the construction and operation of a gas-to-liquids ("GTL") demonstration plant at the Port of Catoosa, Oklahoma. This GTL
project was part of an ultra-clean fuels production and demonstration project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory. The Catoosa plant, which mirrors a
commercial scale plant, successfully demonstrated a fully integrated GTL technology that converted natural gas into a finished fuel, producing more than 5,500 barrels of synthetic products, including
ultra-clean diesel fuel, which was delivered to Integrated Concepts Research Corporation, a project partner, for fleet vehicle testing in Washington, DC and Denali National Park, Alaska. The Catoosa
GTL plant supports our ongoing efforts to explore the potential of GTL technology, and demonstrates how such technology could be incorporated into the design of a commercial GTL facility such as our
proposed gas processing project in Qatar. Future research of GTL technology as well as other gas technologies is being conducted in our integrated gas segment.

In
connection with construction of the Catoosa GTL plant, we advanced Syntroleum $21.3 million under a secured promissory note. The note bears interest at a rate of eight percent
per year and matures on June 30, 2006. If Syntroleum does not repay the note by June 30, 2006, we will have the right to convert the note into credits against future license fees or into
Syntroleum common stock at no less than $6.00 per share and no more than $8.50 per share.

The
above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of resumption of production from the Petronius platform and the timing and levels
of production from the combined Alvheim/Vilje project, the Corrib project, the LPG expansion project and other expansion projects. Some factors which could affect the timing of the resumption of
production from the Petronius platform include unforeseen problems arising from the repair work or further severe weather conditions. Some factors which could affect the timing and production levels
of the Alvheim/Vilje project, the Corrib project, the LPG expansion project and other expansion projects include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for
exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in obtaining necessary government or third party approvals or permits, including Norwegian
regulatory approval for the Vilje PDO, unforeseen problems arising from construction, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the


governmental
or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements.

Reserves

At December 31, 2004, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves totaled approximately 1.139 billion boe, of which 37 percent
were located in the United States. The following table sets forth estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years.

Proved developed reserves represented 62 percent of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2004, as compared to 70 percent
as of December 31, 2003. Of the 430 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2004, only 22 percent have been included as proved reserves for more than
two years while 56 percent were added during 2004.


During
2004, we added net proved reserves of 221 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while producing 122 million boe. These net additions included
extensions, discoveries and other additions of 136 million boe and total revisions of 81 million boe. Of the total net reserve additions, 25 million boe were proved developed and
194 million boe were proved undeveloped. Additionally, we transferred 78 million boe from proved undeveloped to proved developed during 2004. Costs incurred for the periods ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, were $708 million, $780 million and $404 million. These amounts
include our proportionate share of equity investees' costs incurred as these were costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2004, estimated future
development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $718 million, $629 million, and
$105 million.

The
most significant extensions, discoveries and other additions in 2004 are related to the Alvheim/Vilje developments in Norway and the Corrib development in Ireland. Reserve additions
for the Alvheim/Vilje developments totaled 63 million boe, or 46% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. The PDO for the Alvheim development was approved by the Norwegian
authorities during 2004 and approval of the Vilje PDO, which was submitted to the Norwegian government in December 2004, is expected in 2005. Production from the Alvheim/Vilje developments is
expected to begin in 2007. Reserve additions for the Corrib development totaled 16 million boe, or 12% of total extensions, discoveries and other additions. With the planning permission
received from the Irish authorities for the proposed natural gas terminal, which is to be built to bring gas from the Corrib field ashore, development activities are underway. First gas production is
expected in 2007.

The
Alba field in Equatorial Guinea had the most significant positive revisions – 162 million boe. Of this volume, 84 million boe was added due to the
final investment decision on the Equatorial Guinea LNG project, which will use the gas from the Alba field to produce LNG. Startup of the LNG plant is expected in 2007. An additional 66 million
boe is related to additional compression that is expected to be installed in 2010 and will be necessary for the LNG plant to meet its requirements. At the end of 2004, our total proved reserves
associated with the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea totaled 471 million boe, or 41 percent of our total proved reserves.

We
had negative revisions of 51 million boe in Russia and 40 million boe in the Powder River Basin due to disappointing results from development activity. These revisions,
combined with extensions, discoveries and other additions and a small disposition, resulted in total net reductions in reserves of 46 million boe for Russia and 35 million boe for the
Powder River Basin.

The
above estimated quantities of reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves, timing of production from
development projects and timing of the LNG plant activities are forward-looking statements, are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others)
prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these
assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current estimates. With respect to additional factors that may affect the Alvheim/Vilje developments, the Corrib development and
the LNG plant, please refer to page 6.

For
additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" on pages F-45 through
F-46. We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") for the years 2003 and 2002 disclosing the year-end estimated oil and gas reserves. We will file a
similar report for 2004. The year-end estimates reported to the DOE are the same as the estimates reported in the Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

Delivery Commitments

We have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual arrangements.

In
Alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with the local utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 181 bcf of natural gas over the remaining life of
these contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2016. In addition, we own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska LNG plant and a proportionate share of the long-term LNG sales
obligation to two Japanese utility companies. This obligation is estimated to total 110 bcf through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates March 31, 2009. These commitments are
structured with variable-pricing terms. Our production from various gas fields in the Cook Inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts. Our proved reserves and estimated production rates
in the Cook Inlet sufficiently meet these contractual obligations.


In the U.K., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately 210 bcf of natural gas through the remaining life of
these contracts, which terminate in September 2009. Our Brae area production, together with natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, will supply the natural gas to service
these contracts. Our Brae area proved reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated production rates sufficiently meet these contractual obligations. Pricing under these gas sales contracts
is variable.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Our RM&T operations are primarily conducted by MAP and its subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Speedway SuperAmerica LLC ("SSA")
and Marathon Ashland Pipe Line LLC.

Refining

MAP owns and operates seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 948,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The table below sets forth the location and
daily throughput capacity of each of MAP's refineries as of December 31, 2004:

MAP's refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur
recovery units. The refineries can process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical refinery products, including reformulated gasoline. MAP's refineries are integrated via pipelines and barges
to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect the refineries allow the movement of intermediate products to optimize operations and the production of higher margin products.
For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available; gas oil may be moved from Robinson to Detroit where excess fluid catalytic cracking unit
capacity is available; and light cycle oil may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess desulfurization capacity is available.

MAP
also produces asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. MAP manufactures petroleum pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target
and refractory industries. Additionally, MAP manufactures aromatics, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade propylene and slack wax.

During
2004, MAP's refineries processed 939,000 bpd of crude oil and 171,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. The following table sets forth MAP's refinery production by product
group for each of the last three years:

Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are periodically performed at each
refinery. MAP completed major turnarounds at its Garyville, Catlettsburg and Canton refineries during 2004.

MAP
increased its overall crude oil refining capacity during 2004 from 935,000 bpd to 948,000 bpd after completing the planned turnaround and expansion project at the Garyville refinery.
This expansion increased crude oil capacity at Garyville from 232,000 bpd to 245,000 bpd.


The
Catlettsburg refinery multi-year improvement project was completed during early 2004. At a cost of approximately $440 million, the project improves product yields
and lowers overall refinery costs while making gasoline with less than 30 parts per million of sulfur, which allows MAP to meet Tier II gasoline regulations which became effective on January 1,
2004.

MAP
is constructing approximately $300 million in new capital projects for its 74,000 bpd Detroit, Michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $110 million expansion project,
is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100,000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control
regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005.

Marketing

In 2004 MAP's refined product sales volumes (excluding matching buy/sell transactions) totaled 20.4 billion gallons (1,329,000 bpd). The wholesale
distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast, and sales in
the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of MAP's refined product sales volumes in 2004, excluding sales related to matching buy/sell transactions. Approximately
52 percent of MAP's gasoline sales volumes and 92 percent of its distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other
wholesalers in 2004.

Approximately
55 percent of MAP's propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur
are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the United States. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 16 percent of pitch
products are exported into growing markets in Canada, Mexico, India and South America.

MAP
markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast. The MAP customer base includes approximately 800 asphalt-paving
contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

The
following table sets forth the volume of MAP's consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years:

MAP sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. MAP also sells low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states.

As
of December 31, 2004, MAP supplied petroleum products to about 3,900 Marathon and Ashland branded retail outlets located primarily in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and
Illinois. Branded retail outlets are also located in Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Alabama, and South Carolina.

SSA
sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated retail outlets. As of December 31, 2004, SSA had 1,669 retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and
convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the brand names "Speedway" and "SuperAmerica." SSA's revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise totaled
$2.3 billion in 2004, compared with $2.2 billion in 2003. Profit
levels from the sale of such merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.

Pilot
Travel Centers LLC ("PTC"), a joint venture with Pilot Corporation ("Pilot"), is the largest operator of travel centers in the United States with approximately 250 locations in 35
states at December 31, 2004. The travel centers


offer
diesel fuel, gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises brand name restaurants. Pilot and MAP each own a 50 percent interest in PTC.

MAP's
retail marketing strategy is focused on SSA's Midwest operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand, and continued growth for PTC.

Supply and Transportation

MAP obtains the crude oil it processes from negotiated contracts and spot purchases or exchanges. In 2004, MAP's net purchases of U.S. produced crude oil for
refinery input averaged 416,000 bpd, including a net 20,000 bpd from Marathon. In 2004, Canada was the source for 14 percent or 130,000 bpd of crude oil processed and other foreign sources
supplied 42 percent or 393,000 bpd of the crude oil processed by MAP's refineries, including approximately 245,000 bpd from the Middle East. This crude was acquired from various foreign
national oil companies, producing companies and traders.

MAP
operates a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude oil to its refineries and refined products to its marketing areas. At December 31, 2004, MAP owned, leased, or
had an ownership interest in approximately 2,860 miles of crude oil trunk lines and 3,850 miles of product trunk lines. At December 31, 2004 MAP had interests in the following pipelines:

•

100 percent
ownership of Ohio River Pipe Line LLC, which owns the Cardinal Products Pipeline, a refined products pipeline extending from Kenova, West Virginia to
Columbus, Ohio;

•

50 percent
interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a system connecting Gulf Coast refineries with the Midwest market;

•

47 percent
interest in LOOP LLC ("LOOP"), which is the owner and operator of the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of Louisiana;

•

50 percent
interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system;

•

37 percent
interest in the Capline system, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois; and

•

33 percent
interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, which owns a crude oil pipeline extending from Clearbrook, Minnesota to Cottage Grove, Minnesota, which is in the
vicinity of MAP's St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery.

MAP's
84 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically located throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a combination of
pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. MAP's marine transportation operations include towboats and barges that transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers, their
tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. MAP also leases and owns rail cars in various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of tractors, tank
trailers and general service trucks.

Marathon
also has interests in two refined product pipelines which are not part of MAP:

•

17 percent
interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, which is a light-product pipeline system extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Midwest; and

•

6 percent
interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a light-product pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois to Toledo, Ohio.

The
above discussion of the RM&T segment includes forward-looking statements concerning anticipated completion of the Detroit refinery capital projects. Some factors that could affect
the Detroit projects include unforeseen problems arising from construction, regulatory approval constraints, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and
other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.


Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefication and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain other gas processing
facilities and pipeline operations, and marketing and transportation of natural gas. Also included are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects.

Methanol

We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion
of our natural gas production in the Alba field. Methanol sales totaled 980,000 gross metric tons (441,000 net metric tons) in 2004. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and
the U.S.

Natural Gas Marketing and Transportation Activities

In addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we purchase gas from third-party producers and marketers for resale.

We
own a 24 percent interest in Nautilus Pipeline Company, LLC and a 24 percent interest in Manta Ray Offshore Gathering Company, LLC, which are both Gulf of Mexico natural
gas pipeline systems. Additionally, we own a 34 percent interest in the Neptune natural gas processing plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The plant has the capacity to process 600
mmcfd of natural gas, which is supplied by the Nautilus pipeline system.

Alaska LNG

We own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefication plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in
Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, the LNG has been sold under a long-term
contract with two of Japan's largest utility companies. LNG deliveries totaled 62 gross bcf (24 net bcf) in 2004.

Equatorial Guinea LNG Project

During 2004, Marathon and its partner, Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Ecuatorial ("GEPetrol"), the National Oil Company of Equatorial Guinea, through
Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited ("EGHoldings"), began construction of an LNG plant on Bioko Island that will deliver a contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric
tons per year (approximately 460 mmcfd). This project will allow us to monetize our gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the Alba field participants
under a long-term gas supply agreement. Construction of the plant continues to progress and startup is projected for late 2007.

At
the end of 2004, we held a 75 percent economic interest in EGHoldings, with GEPetrol holding the remaining 25 percent economic interest. In connection with the formation
of EGHoldings, GEPetrol was given certain contractual rights with respect to the purchase and resale to a third party of a 13 percent interest in EGHoldings currently held by Marathon. These
rights give GEPetrol the option to purchase this 13 percent interest and resell it to a third party. These rights specify that we will be reimbursed for our historical costs plus an additional
specified rate of return, which escalates depending on the time period during which such purchase and resale occurs, and a right to share in additional proceeds above those amounts under certain
circumstances of resale. If GEPetrol's rights are not exercised within one year from date of project sanction, which was in June 2004, the rights expire.

EGHoldings
has signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement with a subsidiary of BG Group plc ("BGML") under which BGML would purchase the LNG plant's production for a period of
17 years on an FOB Bioko Island basis with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. The LNG would be targeted primarily to a receiving terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where it
would be regasified and delivered into the Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline grid.

Elba Island LNG

During 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes as part of our Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification terminal capacity rights agreement. Under the terms of the
agreement, we can supply up to 58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as LNG) per year, for up to 22 years.

Also
during 2004, we signed an agreement with BP Energy Company ("BP") under which BP will supply us with 58 bcf of natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five years
beginning in the second half of 2005. We will


take
delivery of LNG at the Elba Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the Henry Hub index. This supply agreement with BP enables us to fully utilize our capacity rights at Elba
Island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded gas resources beyond the term of the BP contract. We continue to
actively seek additional cargoes prior to the start of deliveries from BP.

The
above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the estimated construction and startup dates of a LNG liquefaction plant and
related facilities. Factors that could affect the estimated construction and startup dates of the LNG plant and related facilities include, without limitation, unforeseen problems arising from
construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of
sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development of new reserves. We
compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and other properties, for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those
properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. As a consequence, we may
be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore for oil and gas. Acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving
front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other
specialists. Based on industry sources, we believe we currently rank eighth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2003 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.

Marathon
through MAP must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of
petroleum products. MAP believes it ranks fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2004. MAP competes in four distinct
markets – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution – for the sale of refined products and believes it competes with about 40 companies in the wholesale
distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot market; 8
refiner/marketers in the supply of branded petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220 petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum products. We compete in the
convenience store industry through SSA's retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and services. Some
locations also have on-premises brand-name restaurants such as Subway™. We also compete in the travel center industry through our 50 percent ownership in
PTC.

Our
operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally,
results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials
between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing
governmental regulations.

The Separation

On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001 ("Reorganization Agreement"),
Marathon completed the Separation, in which:

•

its
wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded
company; and

•

USX
Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

As
a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. Thomas J. Usher is the
non-executive chairman of the board of both companies, and, as of December 31, 2004, four of the ten remaining members of Marathon's board of directors are also directors of United
States Steel.


In
connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after
the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of
two of those agreements.

Financial Matters Agreement

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all Marathon's principal repayment, interest payment and other
obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by Marathon:

•

obligations
under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009 through
2033;

•

sale-leaseback
financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel's Fairfield Works facility, with the lease term extending to 2012,
subject to extensions;

•

obligations
relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by United States Steel;
and

•

certain
other guarantees.

The
financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for Marathon's discharge from any remaining
liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying Marathon an amount equal to the
remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds. $2 million of
the industrial revenue bonds are scheduled to mature in the period extending through December 31, 2009.

Under
the financial matters agreement, United States Steel shall have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual rights under the lease obligations assumed from Marathon,
including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. United States Steel shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term
of any of the assumed lease obligations without the prior consent of Marathon other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed lease obligations.

The
financial matters agreement also requires United States Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under a guarantee Marathon
provided with respect to all United States Steel's obligations under a partnership agreement between United States Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit Corporation of Delaware and
Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances including if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the
partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax exposures.

The
financial matters agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all covenants
and other obligations under the documents relating to the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed obligations. The
agreement also obligates Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations.

United
States Steel's obligations to Marathon under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel's accounts payable and other
general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security
interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent.

Tax Sharing Agreement

Marathon and United States Steel have a tax sharing agreement that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups. Provisions of this agreement include
the following:

•

for
any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period, ended on or before December 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing payments will be made between Marathon and
United States Steel generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation;


•

no
tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning after December 31, 2001; and

•

provisions
relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any, that result from the Separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free transaction and limitations on
post-Separation activities that might jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation.

Under
the general tax sharing principles in effect before the Separation:

•

the
taxes payable by each of the Marathon Group and the U.S. Steel Group were determined as if each of them had filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return;
and

•

the
U.S. Steel Group would receive the benefit, in the form of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax attributes, consisting principally of net operating
losses and various credits, that its business generated and the parent used on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable.

In
accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the Separation, Marathon made a preliminary settlement with United States Steel of approximately $440 million as the
net tax sharing payments owed to it for the year ended December 31, 2001 under the pre-Separation tax sharing principles.

The
tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before
December 31, 2001.

In
the tax sharing agreement, each of Marathon and United States Steel promised the other party that it:

•

would
not, before January 1, 2004, take various actions or enter into various transactions that might, under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation; and

•

would
be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such as interest and penalties, that results from
the Separation ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such action or entering into any such transaction.

The
prescribed actions and transactions include:

•

the
liquidation of Marathon or United States Steel; and

•

the
sale by Marathon or United States Steel of its assets, except in the ordinary course of business.

In
case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing
agreement to indemnify the first party against that liability.

Even
if the Separation otherwise qualified for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Separation may become taxable to Marathon under
section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if capital stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in either Marathon or United States Steel is acquired, directly or indirectly,
as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Separation. For this purpose, a "50 percent or greater interest" means capital stock possessing at least 50 percent
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of capital stock. To minimize this risk, both
Marathon and United States Steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in their equity structures that could cause the Separation to be
treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to which those provisions of section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code may apply. If an acquisition occurs that results in the
Separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the agreement provides that the resulting corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in that
acquisition transaction.

Although
the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Separation, each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members of the
same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the Separation, is jointly and severally liable under the Internal Revenue Code for the
federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for that year. To address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all or part of a tax liability
from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the agreement includes indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from whom the taxing
authorities are seeking collection to obtain indemnification from the other party, to the extent the agreement allocates that liability to that other party. Marathon can provide no assurance, however,
that United States Steel
will be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to Marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement.


Obligations Associated with the Separation as of December 31, 2004

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations Associated with the Separation of
United States Steel" on page 42 for a discussion of Marathon's obligations associated with the Separation.

Environmental Matters

We maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors. Our
Health, Environment and Safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations. The Health, Environment and Safety Management Committee, which is comprised of our officers, is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance
programs. We also have an Emergency Management Team, composed of senior management, which oversees the response to any major emergency environmental incident involving Marathon or any of our
properties.

Our
businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with
respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage
and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990
("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same matters. These laws and their associated
regulations are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard
to negligence or fault and impose liability on Marathon for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for Marathon's acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we
performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws
have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations, particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing regulations, new
water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.

For
a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" on page 44 and "Legal Proceedings" on page 21.

Air

Of particular significance to MAP are EPA regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004 for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. MAP's combined
capital costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other
refinery upgrade projects. Costs incurred through December 31, 2004 were approximately $520 million. Some factors that could potentially affect MAP's gasoline and diesel fuel compliance
costs include completion of project detailed engineering, construction and startup activities.

The
U.S. EPA has finalized new and revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for fine particulate emissions (PM2.5) and ozone. In connection with these new standards, EPA
will designate certain areas as "nonattainment," meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment areas EPA has proposed a rule called the Interstate
Air Quality Rule ("IAQR") that will require significant reductions of SO


and NOx emissions in numerous states. All of our refinery operations are located in these affected states. If this
rule is finalized, it could have a significant impact on our operations as well as the operations of many of our competitors. At this time, we cannot determine whether the IAQR will be finalized or
whether it will be substantially changed before it is final. As a result, we cannot presently reasonably estimate the financial impact of such a rule.

Water

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to
oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank
vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous


substances.
Also, in case of such releases OPA-90 requires responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for
violations of its provisions.

Additionally,
OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be
retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. As of December 31, 2004, all of the barges used in MAP's river transportation operations meet the
double-hulled requirements of OPA-90.

We
operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Several coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but
with expanded liability provisions,
including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered
by OPA-90.

Solid Waste

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous
wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground
storage tanks ("USTs") containing regulated substances. Since the EPA has not yet promulgated implementing regulations for all provisions of RCRA and has not yet made clear the practical application
of all the implementing regulations it has promulgated, the ultimate cost of compliance with this statute cannot be accurately estimated. In addition, new laws are being enacted and regulations are
being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately
defined.

Remediation

We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state
laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to
the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of
the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement fund once the applicable deductible has been satisfied. Accruals
for remediation expenses and associated reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable.

As
a general rule, Marathon and Ashland retained responsibility for certain remediation costs arising out of the prior ownership and operation of businesses transferred to MAP. Such
continuing responsibility, in certain situations, may be subject to threshold or sunset agreements, which gradually diminish this responsibility over time.

Properties

The location and general character of the principal oil and gas properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and other important
physical properties of Marathon have been described previously. Except for oil and gas producing properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated, such properties are held in fee. The
plants and facilities have been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in age and operating efficiency. At the date of acquisition of important properties, titles were examined and
opinions of counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made specifically for the purpose of this document. The properties classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many years
without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim.

The
basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas
Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves" on pages F-45 through F-46.

Property, Plant and Equipment Additions

For property, plant and equipment additions, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and
Liquidity – Capital Expenditures" on page 39.


Employees

We had 25,804 active employees as of December 31, 2004, including 22,661 MAP employees. Of the total number of MAP employees, 16,413 were
employees of Speedway SuperAmerica LLC, most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets.

Certain
hourly employees at the Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union under labor agreements
that expire on January 31, 2006. The same union represents certain hourly employees at the Texas City refinery under a labor agreement that expires on March 31, 2006. The International
Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2006 at the St. Paul Park refinery and January 31, 2007 at the
Detroit refinery.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of
matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included below in this discussion. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually
or in the aggregate, be material. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved
unfavorably.

Natural Gas Royalty Litigation

Marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that federal and Indian lessees violated the False Claims Act with respect to the reporting
and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids. The first case, U.S. ex rel Jack J. Grynberg v. Alaska Pipeline Co., et al. is primarily a gas measurement case, and the second case,
U.S. ex rel Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al, is primarily a gas valuation case. These cases assert that false claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages and interest
total more than $25 billion. The Department of Justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas companies and also
announced that it would not intervene against certain other defendants including Marathon. The matters are in the discovery phase and Marathon intends to vigorously defend these cases.

Powder River Basin Litigation

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") completed a multi-year review of potential environmental impacts from coal bed methane
development on federal lands in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. The Agency's Record of Decision ("ROD") was signed on April 30, 2003 supporting increased coal bed methane
development. Plaintiff environmental and other groups filed four suits in May 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana against the BLM alleging the Agency's environmental
impact review was not adequate. Plaintiffs seek a court order enjoining coal bed methane development on federal lands in the Powder River Basin until BLM conducts additional studies on the
environmental impact. Marathon has been allowed to intervene as a party in all four of the cases. As the lawsuits to delay energy development in the Powder River Basin progress through the courts, BLM
continues to process permits to drill under the ROD. In January 2004, the Court over protests of Plaintiffs, transferred to the District Court of Wyoming, portions of two of the cases dealing
with the sufficiency of the environmental impact review as to lands in Wyoming.

In
May 2004, plaintiff environmental groups Environmental Defense et al, filed suit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") in Montana Federal District Court, alleging
the agency did not adequately consider air


quality
impacts of coal bed methane and oil and gas operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements. Plaintiffs request that BLM be
ordered to cease issuing leases and permits for energy development, until additional analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. Marathon and Pennaco Energy, Inc. have intervened in the
litigation.

Environmental Proceedings

The following is a summary of proceedings involving Marathon that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2004, under federal and
state environmental laws. Except as described herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, management's belief set forth in the first paragraph
under Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" above takes such matters into account.

Claims
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste
disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") for each site include present and
former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of
identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the
amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, Marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA.

Projections,
provided in the following paragraphs, of spending for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for, or timing
of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements.

At
December 31, 2004, Marathon had been identified as a PRP at a total of six CERCLA waste sites. Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and
incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with all but one of these sites will be under $1 million per site, and most will be under
$100,000. Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under $4 million.

In
addition, there is one site where Marathon has received information requests or other indications that it may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently
available to confirm the existence of liability.

There
are also 131 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state,
or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 14 were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland which has retained liability for all
costs associated with remediation. Based on currently available information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation costs
in connection with 25 of these sites will be under $100,000 per site, 53 sites have potential costs between $100,000 and $1 million per site, 19 sites may involve remediation costs between
$1 million and $5 million per site and 8 sites have incurred remediation costs of more than $5 million per site. There are 11 sites with insufficient information to estimate
future remediation costs.

There
is one site that involves a remediation program in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") at a closed and dismantled refinery site located near
Muskegon, Michigan. During the next five years, Marathon anticipates spending less than $7 million at this site. Expenditures in 2004 were approximately $391,000, and expenditures in 2005 are
expected to be $600,000 as technical evaluation continues, and could be as much as $3,900,000 if soil remediation is commenced in the second half of the year. Ongoing work at this site is subject to
approval by the MDEQ, and a risk-based closure strategy is being developed for approval by the MDEQ.

MAP
has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney General's Office since 2002 concerning MAP's
self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MAP has had periodic discussions with Illinois officials
regarding this matter and more discussions may occur in 2005.


In
July, 2002, Marathon received a Notice of Enforcement from the State of Texas for alleged excess air emissions from its Yates Gas Plant and production operations on its Kloh lease. A
settlement of this matter was finalized in 2004, with Marathon and its co-owners paying a civil penalty of $74,000 and the donation of land as a Supplemental Environmental Project in lieu
of a further penalty of $74,000. Marathon is owner of a 38% interest in the facilities.

In
May, 2003, Marathon received a Consolidated Compliance Order & Notice or Potential Penalty from the State of Louisiana for alleged various air permit regulatory violations.
This matter was settled for a civil penalty of $148,628 and awaits formal closure with the State.

In
August of 2004, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ("WVDEP") submitted a draft consent order to MAP regarding MAP's handling of alleged hazardous waste generated
from tank cleanings in the State of West Virginia. The proposed order seeks a civil penalty of $337,900. MAP has met with the WVDEP and discussions are ongoing in an attempt to resolve this matter.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Not applicable.

PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market on which the Company's common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's common stock is also traded on the
Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange. Information concerning the high and low sales prices for the common stock as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system and the
frequency and amount of dividends paid during the last two years is set forth in "Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" on page F-41.

As
of January 31, 2005, there were 58,340 registered holders of Marathon common stock.

The
Board of Directors intends to declare and pay dividends on Marathon common stock based on the financial condition and results of operations of Marathon Oil Corporation, although it
has no obligation under Delaware law or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to do so. In determining its dividend policy with respect to Marathon common stock, the Board will rely on the
financial statements of Marathon. Dividends on Marathon common stock are limited to legally available funds of Marathon.

The
following table provides information about purchases by Marathon and its affiliated purchaser during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004 of equity securities that are

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Marathon Oil Corporation is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and
transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through our 62 percent owned subsidiary, Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC ("MAP"); and integrated gas. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Certain
sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially
affecting our businesses. These statements typically contain words such as "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "targets," "plans," "projects," "could," "may," "should," "would" or
similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance with "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by
cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements.

Unless
specifically noted, amounts for MAP include the 38 percent interest held by Ashland Inc. ("Ashland"), and amounts for Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited
("EGHoldings") include the 25 percent interest held by Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Ecuatorial ("GEPetrol").

Overview

Exploration and Production

Exploration and production ("E&P") segment revenues correlate closely with prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas produced. The
increase in our E&P segment revenues during 2004 tracked the increase in prices for these commodities. The robust prices for crude oil during 2004 were caused in part by increased demand in
strengthening economies, particularly in the United States and China, weather related damages and disruptions, the influence of OPEC, as well as civil and political unrest and military actions in
various oil exporting countries. The average spot price during 2004 for West Texas Intermediate ("WTI"), a benchmark crude oil, was $41.47 per barrel – up from an average of $30.99
in 2003 – and ended the year at $43.45. The differential between WTI and Brent (an international benchmark crude oil) widened to $3.20 in 2004 from $2.16 in 2003, primarily because
shipping freight rates were much higher in 2004 and it cost more to transport a Brent-based international barrel to the U.S. Marathon's domestic crude production is on average heavier and higher in
sulfur content than light sweet WTI. Heavier and higher sulfur crude oil (commonly referred to as sour crude) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil. The majority of OPEC spare capacity and new
production worldwide is medium sour or heavy sour, so the discount for medium and heavy sour crudes has increased relative to light sweet crude and thus reduced the relative profitability of sour
crude production. Marathon's international crude production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark.

Natural
gas prices were higher in 2004 as compared to 2003. A significant portion of our United States lower 48 natural gas production is sold at bid week prices, making this indicator
particularly important. The average quarterly bid week prices for 2004 were $5.69, $6.00, $5.75 and $7.07 for the first to fourth quarter. Natural gas prices in Alaska are largely contractual, while
natural gas production there is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. Our other major gas-producing
regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where large portions of our gas are sold at contractual prices, making realized prices in these areas less volatile.

additional information on price risk management, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on page 50.

E&P
segment income during 2004 was impacted by lower production (on an equivalent barrel basis) – down approximately 13 percent from 2003 levels. We estimate
that our 2005 production will average approximately 325,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ("BOEPD"), excluding the impact of acquisitions, dispositions or potential reentry into Libya.
Our continued exploration success coupled with ongoing development of our base businesses and new core areas, provides defined production growth that is expected to increase our average daily
production by an estimated compounded average growth rate of five to nine percent between 2005 and 2008.

Projected
production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) prices, supply and demand, regulatory constraints,
reserve estimates, production decline


rates
for mature fields, reserve replacement rates, drilling rig availability and geological and operating considerations. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Prices have historically been
volatile and have frequently been driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in economic activity and political developments in the world's major oil and gas
producing areas, including OPEC member countries. Any substantial decline in such prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A decline in such prices could also
adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development.

E&P
operations are subject to various hazards, including acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, explosions, fires and uncontrollable flows of
oil and gas. Offshore production and marine operations in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, the U.K. Atlantic Margin, the Celtic Sea, offshore Nova Scotia and offshore West Africa are
also subject to severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or violent storms or other hazards. Development of new production properties in countries outside the United States may require protracted
negotiations with host governments and are frequently subject to political considerations, such as tax regulations, which could adversely affect the economics of projects.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

MAP refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States. Refining,
marketing and transportation ("RM&T") segment income primarily represents MAP's income from operations which depends largely on the refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery throughputs,
retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of its pipeline transportation operations.

The
refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of
purchased products and manufacturing costs. MAP purchases crude oil to satisfy the throughput requirements of its refineries. As a result, its refining and wholesale marketing margin could be
adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. The crack spread, which is a measure of the difference between spot market gasoline and
distillate prices and spot market crude costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. In addition to changes in the crack spread, MAP's refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by
the types of crude oil processed, the wholesale selling prices realized for all the products sold and the level of manufacturing costs. MAP processes significant amounts of sour crude oil which
enhances its competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. As crude oil production increases in the coming years, heavy sour crude
oil production growth is expected to outpace sweet crude oil production growth, which may translate into higher sour crude oil discounts going forward. Over the last three years, approximately
60 percent of the crude oil throughput at MAP's refineries has been sour crude oil. Sales of asphalt increase during the highway construction season in MAP's market area which is primarily in
the second and third calendar quarters. The selling price of asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of alternative paving materials and the level of construction activity in both the
private and public sectors. Changes in manufacturing costs from period to period are primarily dependent on the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural
gas. The refining and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile and varies with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical
capabilities and the expectations regarding the adequacy of the supply of refined products and raw materials.

For
information on price risk management, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on page 50.

Additionally,
the retail marketing gasoline and distillate margin, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the wholesale cost of the refined products,
including secondary transportation, plays an important part in downstream profitability. The retail gasoline and distillate margin has been historically volatile, but tends to be countercyclical to
the refining and wholesale marketing margin. Factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of
economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions. Gross margins on merchandise sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross margin from
the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition and the level of
economic activity in the marketing areas. The profitability of MAP's pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The volume of crude oil
that MAP transports is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by MAP's crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance
are the production levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of alternative transportation modes, and the refinery and


transportation
system maintenance levels. The throughput of the refined products that MAP transports is directly affected by the production level of, and user demand for, refined products in the
markets served by MAP's refined product pipelines. In most of MAP's markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September, and declines during
the fall and winter months. The seasonal pattern for distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall movements on an annual basis. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and
maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

Environmental
regulations, particularly the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed (and are expected to continue to impose) increasingly stringent and costly requirements on
refining and marketing operations that may have an adverse effect on margins and financial condition. Refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to
unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. They are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as
capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions.

Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas ("IG") operations include marketing and transporting natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas
("LNG") and methanol, primarily in the United States, Europe and West Africa. Also included are the costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects, such as the LNG
project in Equatorial Guinea. The profitability of these operations depends largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on resale gas, and demand. Methanol spot pricing is volatile largely
because global methanol demand is only 33 million tons and any major unplanned shutdown or addition in production capacity can have a significant impact on the supply-demand balance. IG
operations could be impacted by unforeseen events such as explosions, fires, product spills, inclement weather or availability of LNG vessels. They are also subject to the additional hazards of marine
operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual
results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

Certain
accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary
to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is
material.

Estimated Net Recoverable Quantities of Oil and Gas

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of
proved reserves, both developed and undeveloped. The existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and
timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. Both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and
gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties and the expected future taxable income available to realize the value of deferred tax assets also rely in part on estimates
of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas.

Proved
reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively and negatively, as additional information becomes available and as contractual,
economic and political conditions change. During 2004, net revisions of previous estimates increased total proved reserves by 81 million BOE as a result of 190 million BOE in positive
revisions which were partially offset by 109 million BOE in negative revisions.

Our
estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by internal teams of in-house reservoir engineers and geoscience
professionals. All estimates prepared by these internal teams are approved by members of the Corporate Reserve Group upon input into Marathon's Reserve System. Any change to proved reserves in excess
of 2.5 million BOE, on a field-total basis for a single month, must be approved by the Director of Corporate Reserves. In 2003, we implemented a process to have third party consultants audit
the top 80 percent of our reserves over a 3 year period. Those third party audits have been completed on roughly 50 percent of our year-end 2004 reserves and have not resulted in any reserve
changes. In addition to third party audits, the Corporate Reserve Group routinely audits properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long reserves life, sudden changes in performance,
changes in economic or operating conditions, or recent acquisitions of material fields.

The
reserves of the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea comprise approximately 40 percent of our total proved oil and gas reserves. The next five largest oil and gas producing
asset groups – the Brae Area Complex offshore the United Kingdom, the Alvheim/Vilje development offshore Norway, the Kenai field in Alaska, the Petronius


development
in the Gulf of Mexico and the Foinaven area complex offshore the United Kingdom – comprise a total of approximately 20 percent of our total proved oil and gas
reserves.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which is
generally on a field-by-field basis for E&P assets, at the refinery and associated distribution system level or at the pipeline system level for downstream assets, or at a site
level for retail stores. If the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value.

The
expected future cash flows from our oil and gas producing asset groups require assumptions about matters such as future oil and gas prices, estimated recoverable quantities of oil
and gas, expected field performance and the political environment in the host country. An impairment of any of our large oil and gas producing property asset groups could have a material impact on the
presentation of financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations.

Marathon
evaluates its unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. Information
such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage are also considered.

The
expected future cash flows from our downstream assets require assumptions about matters such as future product prices, future crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining
lives of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the assets' existing service potential.

During
the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an impairment of $32 million related to unproved properties and $12 million related to producing properties primarily due to
unsuccessful developmental drilling activity in Russia. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we did not have significant impairment charges.

Suspended Exploratory Well Costs

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, to drill and
equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized. Costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and
geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized
on our balance sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year
following the completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. It is not unusual for costs associated with complex deepwater or international discoveries to be suspended on our balance sheet for
more than a year while we are performing additional appraisal work, determining an optimal plan of development or awaiting project sanction by our Board of Directors, our co-venturers and
the government entity having jurisdiction over the area under development. However, we continually monitor the progress being made towards the ultimate development of projects to ensure that continued
capitalization is appropriate. At December 31, 2004, total costs capitalized attributable to suspended exploratory well costs were $339 million. Of the $339 million,
$309 million relates to wells in areas where additional exploratory wells are underway or firmly planned. $23 million relates to wells in areas where additional wells are not firmly
planned; however, less than a year has elapsed since the rig release for these wells. The remaining $7 million relates to single well projects that were drilling over year end and completion
costs.

Exploration
expense was $202 million, $180 million and $192 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Costs incurred for exploration as reported on page F-42 was
$291 million, $231 million and $258 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Exploration expense differs from exploration costs incurred due to timing differences between when costs are
incurred and when those costs are ultimately recognized as expense. For example, costs may be incurred and suspended as exploratory well costs in one year and recorded in exploration expense in a
subsequent year if it is ultimately determined that proved reserves cannot be recognized. Additionally, exploration costs incurred for wells that find proved reserves are transferred to proved
property and remain capitalized, and therefore will not be recorded as exploration expense. Instead these costs will be expensed in depreciation, depletion and amortization on a
units-of-production basis once production begins. Exploration expense also includes non-cash charges for unproved property impairments. For 2004, 2003 and 2002
exploration expense included $52 million, $31 million and $25 million


of
unproved property impairment charges. Dry well expense included in exploration expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $54 million, $55 million and $91 million. The remaining
costs included in exploration expense of $96 million, $94 million and $76 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002 represent geological and geophysical costs, administrative expenses and
other expenses.

In
February 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") proposed FASB Staff Position FAS 19-a, "Accounting for Suspended Well Costs" ("FSP
FAS 19-a"), which would amend the guidance for suspended well costs in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies" ("SFAS No. 19"). SFAS No. 19 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If
classification of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of the drilling in an area requiring a major capital expenditure, paragraph 31(a) of SFAS No. 19 provides that the cost
should continue to be carried as an asset provided that (1) there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and
(2) drilling of the additional exploratory well is underway or firmly planned for the near future. If either of those two criteria is not met, SFAS No. 19 indicates the entity should
expense the exploratory well costs. For all other exploratory wells not addressed in paragraph 31(a), paragraph 31(b) provides that the capitalized costs should be charged to expense if
the reserves cannot be classified as proved after a year following the completion of exploratory drilling. Questions have arisen in
practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles. The issue is whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued
capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned
for the near future. The proposed FSP FAS 19-a would allow exploratory well costs to continue to be capitalized when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves
to justify completion as a producing well and (b) the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Our current policy
as described above is in accordance with the proposed FSP FAS 19-a.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation and depletion of producing oil and gas properties is determined by the units-of-production method and could change with
revisions to estimated proved developed recoverable reserves. The change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been
immaterial. A five percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $5.55 per barrel to $5.29 per barrel, which would increase
pre-tax income by $32 million annually. A five percent decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion rate from $5.55 per barrel to $5.84
per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre-tax income of $35 million annually.

Property,
plant and equipment in our RM&T segment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 42 years.
Useful lives are based on historical experience and the assumption that we will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to maintain the assets in good operating condition. Factors which
could affect the estimated useful lives of our RM&T property, plant and equipment include changes in planned use, environmental regulations, competition and technological advances. There have been no
significant changes in the useful lives of our RM&T property, plant and equipment during the 2002-2004 period.

Expected Future Taxable Income

We must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. As of December 31, 2004, we reported net
deferred tax assets of $1.360 billion, which represented gross assets of $1.853 billion net of valuation allowances of $493 million.

Numerous
assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions
(particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and future financial conditions. The estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in
our internal budgets, forecasts and strategic plans.

In
determining our overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted
probable and possible reserves related to our existing producing properties, as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely that
development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future. In assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence concerning the
realization of the impaired deferred tax asset.


Additionally,
we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation
allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred. The principal tax
planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign
subsidiaries are reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile.

Net Realizable Value of Receivables from United States Steel

As described further in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity – Obligations Associated with the
Separation of United States Steel" on page 42, we remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed
responsibility for repayment under the terms of the Separation. As of December 31, 2004, we have reported receivables from United States Steel of $602 million, representing the amount of
principal and accrued interest on Marathon debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment. We must assess the realizability of these receivables, based on our expectations
of United States Steel's ability to satisfy its obligations. To make this assessment, we must rely on public information about United States Steel. As of December 31, 2004, we have judged the
entire receivable to be realizable.

We
may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by United States Steel on a significant portion of this receivable until December 31, 2011. Of the $602 million,
$472 million, or 78 percent, relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in 2011 or later. The Financial Matters Agreement between Marathon and United States Steel provides that, on
or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, which is December 31, 2011, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed
industrial revenue bonds.

As
of December 31, 2004, our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (which includes debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility
for repayment and suspended cash distributions to Ashland) was 8 percent. The assessment of our liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations concerning United States Steel's
ability to satisfy its obligations.

If
the debt for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation, our cash-adjusted
debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, 2004 would have been approximately 1 percent. On the other hand, if the receivable from United States Steel had been
written off as unrealizable, the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, 2004 would have been approximately 8 percent. (If United
States Steel were unable to
satisfy its obligations, other adjustments in addition to the write-off of the receivable may be necessary.)

Contingent Liabilities

We accrue contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability claims and litigation claims when such
contingencies are probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates for multiple reasons. For instance, the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on
differing interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may change because of changes in laws,
regulations and their interpretation; the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination; and improvements in technology. Our in-house legal counsel
regularly assesses these contingent liabilities. In certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized.

Under
the accounting rules, a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. We generally record these losses as
"Costs of revenues" or "Selling, general and administrative expenses" on the Consolidated Statement of Income, except for tax contingencies, which are recorded as "Other taxes" or "Provision for
income taxes." For additional information on contingent liabilities, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies" on page 44.

An
estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.


Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves assumptions related to:

•

discount
rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations

•

expected
long-term rates of return on plan assets

•

rate
of future increases in compensation levels

•

health
care cost projections

We
develop our demographics and utilize the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. In determining the discount rate, we review market yields on
high-quality corporate debt and perform an in-depth analysis of projected pension plan cash flows relating to the duration of pension plan liabilities.

The
asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent equity securities and 25 percent debt securities),
past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields. Peer data and historical returns are
reviewed to check for reasonableness.

Compensation
increase assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.

Health
care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

Note 23
to the Consolidated Financial Statements, beginning on page F-30, includes detailed information for the three years ended December 31, 2004, on the
components of pension and other postretirement expense and the underlying assumptions as well as the funded status for the company's pension plans for the years ended 2004 and 2003.

Of
the assumptions used to measure the December 31, 2004 obligations and estimated 2005 net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the
periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. A .25 percent decrease in the discount rate of 5.75 percent for domestic and 5.30 percent for international would increase pension
and other postretirement plan expense by approximately $13 million and $2 million, respectively.

Estimated Fair Value of Derivative Contracts

We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk throughout our different businesses. These risks relate to
commodities, interest rates and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We use derivative instruments that are exchange traded and non-exchange traded. Non-exchange
traded instruments are referred to as over-the-counter ("OTC") instruments.

For
commodities, the fair value of exchange traded instruments is based on existing market quotes. Fair value for OTC instruments such as options and swap agreements is developed through
the use of option-pricing models or third party market quotes. Forward contracts are valued based on quotes from the counterparties of the forward contracts.

We
also have two long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). These contracts expire in September 2009. These contracts were entered
into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the East Brae field and the SAGE pipeline. Contract prices are linked to a basket of energy and other indices. The contract price is reset
annually in October based on the previous twelve-month changes in the basket of indices. Consequently, the prices under these contracts do not track forward gas prices.

These
U.K. gas contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments. The fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the U.K.
forward gas strip price to the expected sales volumes for the next eighteen months under these contracts. Adjustments to the fair value of these contracts result in noncash charges or credits to
income from operations. The difference between the contract price and the U.K. forward gas strip price may fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect income from operations.

The
noncash change in fair value recognized in earnings was a loss of $99 million in 2004, a loss of $66 million in 2003 and a gain of $18 million in 2002. These
effects are primarily due to the U.K. 18-month forward gas price curve strengthening 36 and 26 percent during 2004 and 2003 and weakening 12 percent during 2002.

additional information on market risk sensitivity, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on page 50.

Matching buy/sell transactions

Matching buy/sell transactions are arrangements in which we agree to buy a specific quantity and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products to be delivered
at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products at a different location, usually with the same counterparty.
All matching buy/sell transactions are settled in cash and are recorded in both revenues and costs of revenues as separate sales and purchase transactions, or on a "gross" basis.

In
a typical buy/sell transaction, we enter into a contract to sell a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a specified location and date to a particular counterparty, and
simultaneously agree to buy a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a different location on the same or another specified date, typically from the same counterparty. The value of the
purchased volumes rarely equals the sales value of the sold volumes. The value difference between purchases and sales are primarily due to 1) grade/quality differentials, 2) location
differentials or 3) timing differences, in those instances when the purchase and sale do not occur in the same month.

For
the E&P segment, we enter into matching buy/sell transactions to reposition crude oil from one market center to another in order to maximize the value received for our crude oil
production. For the RM&T segment, we enter into crude oil matching buy/sell transactions to secure the most profitable refinery supply and refined product matching buy/sell transactions to meet
projected customer demands and to secure the required volumes in the most cost-effective manner.

The
characteristics of our matching buy/sell transactions include gross invoicing between Marathon and its counterparties and cash settlement of the transactions. Nonperformance by one
party to deliver generally does not relieve the other party's obligation to perform. Both transactions require physical delivery of the product. The risks and rewards of ownership are evidenced by
title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk, counterparty nonperformance risk and the fact that we have the primary obligation to perform.

We
believe matching buy/sell transactions are monetary in nature and thus outside the scope of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("APB No. 29").
Additionally, we have evaluated EITF No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent" ("EITF No. 99-19") and, based on that evaluation,
management believes that the recording these transactions on a gross basis is appropriate.

The
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") is currently considering Issue No. 04-13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty," ("EITF
No. 04-13"), which relates to transactions in which an entity sells inventory to another entity in the same line of business from which it also purchases inventory. The following
questions have been raised regarding the accounting for these types of transactions and are expected to be addressed by the EITF:

(a)

Under
what circumstances should two or more transactions with the same counterparty (counterparties) be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of APB
No. 29?

(b)

If
nonmonetary transactions within the scope of APB No. 29 involve inventory, are there any circumstances under which the transactions should be recognized at fair value?

The
EITF has not yet addressed the first question. The EITF discussed the second question at its November 2004 meeting without reaching any consensus. If the EITF were to
determine that these transactions should be accounted for as monetary transactions on a gross basis, no change in our accounting policy for matching buy/sell transactions would be necessary. If the
EITF were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions qualifying for fair value recognition and require a net presentation of such transactions, the
amounts of revenues and cost of revenues associated with matching buy/sell transactions would be netted in our consolidated statement of income, but there would be no effect on income from operations,
net income or cash flows from operations. If the EITF were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions not qualifying for fair value recognition, these
amounts of revenues and cost of revenues would be netted in our consolidated statement of income and there could be an impact on income from operations and net income related to the timing of the
ultimate sale of product purchased in the "buy" side of the matching buy/sell transaction. However, management does not believe any impact would be material. There would be no impact on cash flows
from operations as a result of this accounting treatment.

E&P segment revenues increased by $86 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $334 million in 2003 from 2002. The 2004 increase was
primarily due to higher worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices. This increase was partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes and decreased crude oil marketing
activities. The 2003 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices and increased crude oil marketing activities. This increase was partially offset by lower
liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes. Derivative losses totaled $268 million in 2004, compared to losses of $176 million in 2003 and gains of $52 million in 2002. These
results included losses of $99 million in 2004 compared to losses of $66 million in 2003 and gains of $18 million in 2002 related to long-term natural gas contracts in
the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on page 50 for discussion of derivative instruments and associated
market risk. Matching buy/sell transactions decreased by $55 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $67 million in 2003 from 2002. The 2004 and 2003 decreases were primarily due to decreased
crude oil buy/sell transactions, partially offset by higher domestic liquid hydrocarbon prices.

RM&T
segment revenues increased by $9.116 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $8.115 billion in 2003 from 2002. The increases primarily resulted from higher refined product
selling prices and volumes and increased crude oil sales volumes and prices. Matching buy/sell transactions increased by $2.061 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $2.745 billion in 2003
from 2002. The 2004 increase was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and refined product prices and increased crude oil and refined products buy/sell transaction volumes. The 2003 increase was
primarily due to increased crude oil buy/sell transactions and higher liquid hydrocarbon and refined product prices, partially offset by lower refined product buy/sell transaction volumes.

IG
segment revenues decreased by $509 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $1.031 billion in 2003 from 2002. The decrease in 2004 is due to a decrease in natural gas
marketing activities, partially offset by higher natural gas prices. The increase in 2003 is a result of higher natural gas prices and increased natural gas marketing activity. Derivative gains
totaled $17 million in 2004, compared to gains of $19 million in 2003 and losses of $8 million in 2002.

For
additional information on segment results, see the discussion on income from operations on page 35.

Income
from equity method investments increased by $141 million in 2004 from 2003 and decreased by $108 million in 2003 from 2002. The increase in 2004 and decrease in 2003
is due to a $124 million loss on the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P. ("MKM") recorded in 2003. Results for 2004 also include increased earnings of
other equity method investments, primarily Atlantic Methanol Production Company ("AMPCO"). The loss on the dissolution of MKM in 2003 was partially offset by increased earnings of other equity method
investments due to higher natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices. For further discussion of the dissolution of MKM, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net
gains on disposal of assets decreased by $130 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $99 million in 2003 from 2002. Results from 2004 include the sale of various
SSA stores. During 2003, we sold our interest in CLAM Petroleum B.V. ("CLAM"), interests in several pipeline companies, Yates field and gathering system, SSA stores primarily in Florida, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, and certain fields in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. Results from 2002 include the sale of various SSA stores and the sale of San Juan Basin assets.


Gain
or loss on ownership change in MAP results from contributions to MAP of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by Marathon and Ashland.
In accordance with MAP's limited liability company agreement, in certain instances, environmental capital expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of
the assets, but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions. An excess of Ashland funded improvements over Marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of
Marathon funded improvements over Ashland funded improvements results in a net loss.

Cost of revenues

increased by $5.822 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $6.040 billion in 2003 from 2002. The increases are
primarily in the RM&T segment and result from higher acquisition costs for crude oil, refined products, refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased by $105 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $97 million in 2003 from 2002.
The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing. Our 2004 results were also impacted by
start-up costs associated with the LNG project in Equatorial Guinea and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased
employee benefit expenses (caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets) and other employee related costs.
Additionally, during 2003, we recorded a charge of $24 million related to organizational and business process changes.

Inventory market valuation reserve ("IMV")

is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value. Generally, we
will establish an IMV reserve when crude oil prices fall below $22 per barrel. The 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $71 million, reversing the IMV reserve
at December 31, 2001.

Net interest and other financial costs

decreased by $25 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $82 million in 2003 from 2002. The
decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income. The decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term
construction projects, the favorable effect of interest rate swaps, the favorable effect of a reduction in interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments. Additionally,
included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $9 million, $13 million and $8 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Loss from early extinguishment of debt in

2002 was attributable to the retirement of $337 million aggregate principal amount of debt,
resulting in a loss of $53 million.

Minority interest in income of MAP,

which represents Ashland's 38 percent ownership interest, increased by $230 million in
2004 from 2003 and by $129 million in 2003 from 2002. MAP income was higher in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the RM&T segment.

Minority interest in loss of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited,

which represents GEPetrol's 25 percent ownership interest, was
$7 million in 2004, primarily resulting from GEPetrol's share of start-up costs associated with the LNG project in Equatorial Guinea.

Provision for income taxes

increased by $143 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $215 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to
$388 million and $720 million increases in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for 2004 was 36.6 percent compared to 36.6 percent and 42.1 percent for
2003 and 2002. The higher rate in 2002 was due to the United Kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the North Sea oil and gas production, retroactively effective to
April 17, 2002. In 2002, we recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $61 million as a result of the rate increase.

Discontinued operations

in 2003 primarily relates to our E&P operations in western Canada, which were
sold in 2003 for a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million. Also, included in 2003 results is an $8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to United States
Steel Corporation. Results for 2002 report the western Canadian operations as discontinued.

Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles

of $4 million, net of a tax provision of $4 million, in 2003 represents
the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"), in which we recognized in income the cumulative effect
of recording the fair value of asset retirement obligations. The $13 million gain, net of a tax provision of $7 million, in 2002 represents the adoption of subsequently issued
interpretations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
No. 133") in which we must recognize in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom.

Net income

decreased by $60 million in 2004 from 2003 and increased by $805 million in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to the
factors discussed above.

Domestic E&P income

decreased by $82 million in 2004 from 2003 following an increase of
$429 million in 2003 from 2002. The decrease in 2004 was due to lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes primarily resulting from natural declines in field production rates,
weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and the sale of the Yates field, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher
natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices, lower dry well expense and a $25 million favorable contract settlement, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes and
derivative losses. Derivative losses totaled $118 million in 2004, compared to losses of $91 million in 2003 and gains of $32 million in 2002.

In
late September 2004, certain production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated due to hurricane activity resulting in shut-in of approximately 40 thousand
barrels per day ("mbpd") of liquid hydrocarbon and 95 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd") of natural gas production. Restoration of production began following the hurricanes and all facilities were
back on line by October 1, 2004 with the exception of the Petronius platform which is expected to be back on line by the end of the second quarter 2005. At the time of shut-in, the
Petronius field was producing approximately 23.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ("mboepd") net to Marathon. As a result of the damage to the Petronius platform, we recorded expense of
$11 million representing repair costs incurred, partially offset by the net effects of the property damage insurance recoveries and the related retrospective insurance premiums. We also
recorded income of $34 million for business interruption insurance recoveries.

Our
domestic average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $32.76 per barrel ("bbl") in 2004, compared to $27.02 per bbl in 2003 and $22.35 per bbl in 2002. Average
gas prices were $4.89 per thousand cubic feet ("mcf") excluding derivative activity in 2004, compared with $4.53 per mcf in 2003 and $2.87 per mcf in 2002.

Domestic
net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 27 percent to 81 mbpd in 2004, as a result of natural declines mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane damage to the
Petronius platform and the sale of Yates field in November 2003. Net natural gas production averaged 631 mmcfd, down 14 percent from 2003, as a result of hurricane damage to the
Petronius platform and natural declines in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico.

Domestic
net liquid hydrocarbons production decreased 11 percent to 111 mbpd in 2003, as a result of natural declines mainly in the Gulf of Mexico and dispositions. Net natural
gas production averaged 732 mmcfd, down 2 percent from 2002.

International E&P income

increased by $198 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $92 million in 2003 from 2002. The increase in
2004 was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and volumes partially offset by higher derivative losses. The increase in 2003 was due to higher natural gas and liquid
hydrocarbon prices and higher liquid hydrocarbon volumes partially offset by lower natural gas volumes and derivative losses. Derivative losses totaled $51 million in 2004, compared to losses
of $19 million in 2003 and gains of $2 million in 2002.

Our
international average liquid hydrocarbons price excluding derivative activity was $33.68 per bbl in 2004, compared with $26.24 per bbl in 2003 and $23.85 per bbl in 2002. Average gas
prices were $3.33 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2004, compared with $2.80 per mcf in 2003 and $2.35 per mcf in 2002.

International
net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 11 percent to 89 mbpd in 2004 primarily due to increased production in Equatorial Guinea and a full year of production
from Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation ("KMOC") which was acquired in 2003. Net natural gas production averaged 368 mmcfd, up 1 percent from 2003 due to increased production from the condensate
expansion project in Equatorial Guinea, offset by the disposition in 2003 of our interest in CLAM.

International
net liquid hydrocarbons production increased 2 percent to 80 mbpd in 2003 primarily due to the acquisition of KMOC, partially offset by lower production in the U.K.
Net natural gas production averaged 364 mmcfd, down 5 percent from 2002, primarily from lower production in Ireland and the disposition of our interest in CLAM. This decrease was partially
offset by increased production in Equatorial Guinea.

RM&T segment income

increased by $587 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $447 million in 2003 from 2002. The 2004 increase
primarily results from a higher refining and wholesale marketing margin, which averaged 8.8 cents per gallon versus 6.0 cents in 2003. Margins improved initially due to the market's concerns about
refiners' ability to supply the new Tier II low sulfur gasolines which were required effective January 1, 2004 and, more recently, due to concerns about the adequacy of distillate supplies
heading into winter. In addition, the widening of price differentials between sweet and sour crude positively affected the 2004 results. For the full year 2004 MAP averaged 939,000 barrels of crude
oil throughput per day or 99 percent of average system capacity. The 2003 increase was primarily due to an improved refining and wholesale marketing margin, as well as a higher gasoline and


distillate
retail gross margin partially offset by higher administrative expenses. The refining and wholesale marketing margin in 2003 averaged 6.0 cents per gallon, versus 2002 level of 3.9 cents.
The gasoline and distillate gross margin for its retail business was 12.3 cents per gallon in 2003, as compared to 10.1 cents per gallon in 2002. The higher administrative expenses were due primarily
to higher employee related costs. Results for 2003 also included $34 million of gains from the sale of certain interests in refined product pipelines.

Derivative
losses, which are included in the refining and wholesale marketing margin, were $272 million in 2004 compared to $158 million in 2003 and $124 million in
2002. These derivative losses were generally incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories and to protect
crack spread values.

Gains
on the sale of SSA stores included in segment income were $17 million, $8 million and $37 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

IG segment income

increased by $51 million in 2004 from 2003, following a decrease of $26 million in 2003 from 2002. The
increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in AMPCO and higher income from LNG operations, partially offset by costs associated with ongoing development of certain
integrated gas projects and lower margins from gas marketing activities, including recognized changes in the fair value of derivatives used to support those activities. The AMPCO methanol plant in
Equatorial Guinea operated at a 95 percent on-stream factor in 2004 and prices were strong, averaging nearly $227 per ton for the year. Additionally, the 2003 results included an
impairment charge of $22 million on an equity
method investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of two tanker operating leases. The decrease in 2003 is due to the impairment charge of $22 million and the loss of
$17 million on leases as discussed above and higher expenses related to the development of an integrated gas business, partially offset by higher AMPCO earnings.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity

Financial Condition

Current assets

increased $2.823 billion from year-end 2003, primarily due to an increase in cash
and cash equivalents and receivables. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the issuance on March 31, 2004, of 34,500,000 shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds
of $1.004 billion and the suspension of cash distributions to Ashland. The increase in receivables was mainly due to higher year-end commodity prices.

Current liabilities

increased $1.046 billion from year-end 2003, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as a
result of higher priced year-end crude oil purchases at MAP.

Investments and long-term receivables

increased $223 million from year-end 2003, primarily due to
contributions to an equity investee to fund the LPG expansion project in Equatorial Guinea and restricted cash of $66 million at EGHoldings.

Net property, plant and equipment

increased $980 million from year-end 2003. Net property, plant and equipment for each
of the last two years is summarized in the following table:

The increase in international E&P is due to the construction of the Alba field condensate expansion project in Equatorial Guinea. The increase in
RM&T is primarily due to refinery upgrade projects to enable the production of low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel and the Detroit, Michigan refinery expansion project, partially offset by sales of
SSA stores. The increase in IG is primarily due to costs associated with the LNG project in Equatorial Guinea.

Long-term debt

at December 31, 2004 was $4.057 billion, a decrease of $28 million from year-end
2003. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" on page 40, for further discussion.


Asset retirement obligations

increased $87 million from year-end 2003 primarily due to revisions of previous estimates
caused by the impact of a weakening U.S. dollar on foreign asset retirement obligations, as well as drilling activity during 2004.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing operations)

totaled $3.730 billion in 2004,
compared with $2.665 billion in 2003 and $2.331 billion in 2002. The increases mainly resulted from the effects of higher worldwide natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons prices and a
higher refining and wholesale marketing margin.

Net cash provided from operating activities (for discontinued operations)

totaled $83 million in 2003, compared with
$69 million in 2002 related to our E&P operations in western Canada sold in 2003.

Amounts
exclude the acquisitions of KMOC in 2003 and the Equatorial Guinea interests in 2002.

Capital expenditures in 2004 totaled $2.237 billion compared with $1.892 billion and $1.520 billion in 2003 and 2002,
excluding the acquisitions of KMOC in 2003 and Equatorial Guinea interests in 2002. The $345 million increase in 2004 mainly resulted from increased spending in the IG segment associated with
the LNG project in Equatorial Guinea. The $372 million increase in 2003 mainly resulted from increased spending in the RM&T segment at the Catlettsburg refinery and on the Cardinal Products
Pipeline and in the E&P segment in West Africa and Norway. The increase in IG in 2003 was due to the purchase of a 30 percent interest in two LNG tankers which we previously leased and project
development costs associated with the LNG project in Equatorial Guinea. The decrease in corporate capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to the implementation of SAP financial and operations
software in prior years.

Acquisitions

included cash payments of $252 million in 2003 for the acquisition of KMOC and $1.160 billion in 2002 for the
acquisition of the interests in Equatorial Guinea. For further discussion of acquisitions, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash from disposal of assets

was $76 million in 2004, compared with $1.256 billion including the disposal of discontinued
operations, in 2003 and $146 million in 2002. In 2004, proceeds were primarily from the sale of certain SSA stores and various domestic producing properties. In 2003, proceeds were primarily
from the disposition of our E&P properties in western Canada, the Yates field and gathering system, our interest in CLAM, various SSA stores, our interest in several pipeline companies and certain
fields in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming. In 2002, proceeds were primarily from the disposition of various SSA stores and the sale of our San Juan Basin assets.

Net cash provided from financing activities

totaled $527 million in 2004, compared with net cash used of $888 million in 2003
and net cash provided of $88 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 was due to $1.004 billion in net proceeds from the March 31, 2004, issuance of 34,500,000 shares of common stock
as well as the suspension of distributions to the minority shareholder of MAP. This was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to stockholders. The decrease in 2003 was due to activity in
2002 primarily associated with financing the acquisitions of Equatorial Guinea interests of $1.160 billion. This was partially offset by the $295 million repayment of preferred
securities in 2002 that became redeemable or were converted to a right to receive cash upon the Separation. In early January 2002, we paid $185 million to retire the 6.75% Convertible
Quarterly Income Preferred Securities and $110 million to retire the 6.50% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.


Derivative Instruments

See "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" on page 50, for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.

Dividends to Stockholders

On January 23, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 28 cents per share on our common stock, payable March 10, 2005, to stockholders of
record at the close of business on February 16, 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and access to
both the debt and equity capital markets. Our ability to access the debt capital market is supported by our investment grade credit ratings. Because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives
available to us, including internally generated cash flow, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund operations, including our capital spending
program, repayment of debt maturities for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007, and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.

Our
senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings with ratings of BBB+, Baa1, and
BBB+, respectively. Our investment-grade credit ratings were affirmed by these agencies following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Ashland's 38 percent ownership interest in MAP.

We
have a committed $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that terminates in May 2009. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against
this facility. At December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the five-year
revolving credit facility. Additionally, we have other uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million, of which no amounts were drawn at December 31, 2004.

MAP
has a committed $500 million five-year revolving credit facility with third-party financial institutions that terminates in May 2009. MAP also has a
$190 million revolving credit agreement with Ashland that expires in March 2005. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against these facilities. Pursuant to the terms of
our agreement to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in MAP currently held by Ashland (see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), MAP's use of its credit agreement with
Ashland was restricted after September 30, 2004 and we anticipate the credit agreement will be terminated if the transaction is completed.

The
Marathon and MAP revolving credit facilities each require a representation at an initial borrowing that there has been no change in the respective borrower's consolidated financial
position or operations, considered as a whole, that would materially and adversely affect such borrower's ability to perform its obligations under its revolving credit facility.

On
March 31, 2004, we completed the sale of 34,500,000 shares of common stock at the offering price of $30 per share from the $2.7 billion universal shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2002. We recorded net proceeds of $1.004 billion related to this issuance. As of December 31, 2004 there was
$1.7 billion aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities and/or other securities, including securities convertible
into or exchangeable for other equity or debt securities available to be issued under this shelf registration statement.

Cash
and cash equivalents totaled $3.369 billion at December 31, 2004, as compared to $1.396 billion at December 31, 2003. We expect to utilize a substantial
portion of this cash to repay debt assumed in connection with the proposed acquisition of Ashland's interest in MAP and related businesses, to retire other outstanding long-term debt or
for other general corporate purposes.

Cash
distributions from MAP have been suspended pending consummation of the agreement to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in MAP currently held by Ashland. If the
proposed transaction closes, Ashland would receive additional proceeds equal to 38 percent of MAP's distributable cash at the time of closing. If the transaction does not close, Ashland would
receive its share of these funds as part of MAP's normal distributions. Ashland's share on December 31, 2004 was $574 million.


Our
cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total-debt-minus-cash to
total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 8 percent at December 31, 2004, compared to 33 percent at year-end 2003 as shown
below. This includes approximately $594 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel Corporation ("United States Steel") and the above suspended distributions to Ashland. We
continually monitor our spending levels, market conditions and related interest rates to maintain what we perceive to be reasonable debt levels.

We
anticipate cash payments for interest of $251 million for 2005, $453 million for 2006-2007, $383 million for 2008-2009 and $1.596 billion
for the remaining years for a total of $2.683 billion.

The
majority of 2005's contractual obligations to purchase crude oil, refinery feedstock and refined products relate to contracts to be satisfied within the first

We
have acquired the right to deliver to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal 58 bcf of natural gas per year. The agreement's primary term ends in
2021. Pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the LNG re-gasification terminal.

We
are a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline. This agreement is used by Alliance Pipeline to secure its financing.
This arrangement represents an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. Therefore, this amount has also been disclosed as a guarantee. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
complete discussion of our guarantee.

(g)

Commitments
for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed
immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs.

(h)

We
have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance. We have estimated projected funding
requirements through 2014.

(i)

Includes
$694 million of contractual cash obligations that have been assumed by United States Steel. For additional information, see "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel – Summary of Contractual Cash
Obligations Assumed by United States Steel" on page 43.

Contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from the above table.
These include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors.

Our
opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently
available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our
performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future
performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even
though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes,
we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources; and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance
sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.

We
have provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated affiliates, United States Steel and certain lease contracts. These arrangements are described in Note 28 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
are a party to agreements that would require us to purchase, under certain circumstances, the interests in MAP and in Pilot Travel Centers LLC ("PTC") not currently owned. These
put/call agreements are described in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
are party to an agreement that would require us to sell, under certain circumstances, a 13 percent interest in EGHoldings to GEPetrol at historical cost plus an additional
specified rate of return for a period of one year from the date of project sanction. This agreement is described in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nonrecourse Indebtedness of Investees

Certain of our equity investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. If we were obligated to share in this debt on a
pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been approximately $299 million as of December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $170 million relates to PTC. If any of these equity
investees default, we have no obligation to support the debt. Our partner in PTC has guaranteed $157 million of the total PTC debt.


Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel

On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary,
United States Steel, to holders of its USX – U. S. Steel Group class of common stock ("Steel Stock") in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a
one-for-one basis (the "Separation").

We
remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms
of the Separation. United States Steel's obligations to Marathon are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel's accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. If
United States Steel fails to satisfy these obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights
under the leases assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to
increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.

As
of December 31, 2004, we have identified the following obligations totaling $671 million that have been assumed by United States Steel:

•

$472 million
of industrial revenue bonds related to environmental improvement projects for current and former United States Steel facilities, with maturities ranging
from 2009 through 2033. Accrued interest payable on these bonds was $8 million at December 31, 2004.

•

$71 million
of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for equipment at United States Steel's Fairfield Works, with a term extending to 2012, subject to
extensions. There was no accrued interest payable on this financing at December 31, 2004.

•

$51 million
of obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel's Clairton cokemaking facility, with a term extending to 2012. There was no accrued
interest payable on this financing at December 31, 2004.

•

$55 million
of operating lease obligations, of which $42 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major equipment used in plants and operations divested by
United States Steel.

•

A
guarantee of United States Steel's $14 million contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent owned joint venture
PRO-TEC Coating Company.

•

A
guarantee of all obligations of United States Steel as general partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P. to the limited partners. United States Steel has reported that
it currently has no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. For further discussion of the Clairton 1314B guarantee, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Of
the total $671 million, obligations of $602 million and corresponding receivables from United States Steel were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet (current
portion – $15 million; long-term portion – $587 million). The remaining $69 million was related to off-balance sheet
arrangements and contingent liabilities of United States Steel.

The
table below provides aggregated information on the portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by United States Steel as of
December 31, 2004:

We
anticipate cash payments for interest of $27 million for 2005, $53 million for 2006-2007, $53 million for 2008-2009 and $53 million for
the later years to be assumed by United States Steel.

Each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members of the same consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on or before
December 31, 2001, is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. Marathon and United States Steel have
entered into a tax sharing agreement that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended on or before December 31, 2001.


The
agreement includes indemnification provisions to address the possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing agreement allocates
that liability to the other party. In 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, we paid $16 million to United States Steel in connection with the settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of USX Corporation for the years 1992 through 1994.

United
States Steel reported in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness
including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity. However, United States Steel management believes that
its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. During periods of weakness in the manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy, United States Steel believes that it
can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending, sale of non-strategic assets and other cash conservation measures.

Transactions with Related Parties

We own a combined 63 percent working interest in the Alba field. We own a net 52 percent interest in an onshore LPG processing plant through an
equity method investee, Alba Plant LLC. Additionally, we own a 45 percent interest in an onshore methanol production plant through AMPCO, an equity method investee. We sell our marketed natural
gas from the Alba field to Alba Plant LLC and AMPCO. AMPCO uses the natural gas to manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through another equity method investee, AMPCO Marketing LLC.

MAP's
related party sales to its 50 percent equity method investee, PTC, consists primarily of refined petroleum products which accounted for approximately 2 percent of its
total sales revenue for 2004 and 2003. PTC is the largest travel center network in the United States and operates approximately 250 travel centers nationwide. MAP also sells refined petroleum products
consisting mainly of petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to Ashland which owns a 38 percent interest in MAP. MAP's sales to Ashland accounted for approximately 1 percent of its
total sales revenue for 2004 and 2003. We believe that these transactions were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.

In
2004, Marathon and GEPetrol announced that all of the necessary agreements had been finalized for a LNG plant, including the formation of the jointly-owned holding company EGHoldings.
Marathon holds a 75 percent economic interest and GEPetrol holds a 25 percent economic interest in EGHoldings. As of December 31, 2004, total expenditures of $551 million,
including $524 million of capital expenditures, related to the LNG project have been incurred. Cash held in escrow of $66 million to fund future contributions from GEPetrol is classified
as restricted cash and is included in investments and long-term receivables. Payables to related parties include $23 million payable to GEPetrol.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of
environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately recovered in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be adversely affected. We
believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of
factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of
crude oil and refined products.

Our
environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were

Total

$

$


(a)

Amounts
are determined based on American Petroleum Institute survey guidelines and include 100 percent of MAP.

(b)

These
amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.


Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 19 percent of total capital expenditures in 2004, 17 percent in 2003, and eight
percent in 2002.

We
accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental
remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.

We
have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at six waste sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") as
of December 31, 2004.
In addition, there is one site where we have received information requests or other indications that we may be a PRP under CERCLA but where sufficient information is presently unavailable to confirm
the existence of liability. At many of these sites, we are one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation, as well as our share thereof, is frequently dependent on the outcome
of investigations and remedial studies.

There
are also 131 additional sites, excluding retail marketing outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes, both federal and state,
or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation. Of these sites, 14 were associated with properties conveyed to MAP by Ashland for which Ashland has retained
liability for all costs associated with remediation.

New
or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but
since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate
costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.

Our
environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $438 million or 15 percent of capital expenditures in 2005. Predictions beyond 2005 can only be
broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the
availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $200 million in 2006;
however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if
additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.

New
Tier II gasoline and on-road diesel fuel rules require substantially reduced sulfur levels for gasoline and diesel starting in 2004 and 2006, respectively. The combined
capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately $900 million over the period between 2002 and 2006 and includes costs that could be
incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects. This is a forward-looking statement. Costs incurred through December 31, 2004, were approximately $520 million. Some factors (among
others) that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include completion of project detailed engineering, construction and start-up activities.

MAP
has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney General's Office since 2002 concerning MAP's
self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MAP has had periodic discussions with Illinois officials
regarding this matter and more discussions may occur in 2005.

During
2001, MAP entered into a New Source Review consent decree and settlement of alleged Clean Air Act ("CAA") and other violations with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency
covering all of MAP's refineries. The settlement committed MAP to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to MAP's refineries over
approximately an eight-year period. The total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $370 million over the eight-year
period, with about $240 million incurred through December 31, 2004. The impact of the settlement on ongoing operating expenses is expected to be immaterial. In addition, MAP has nearly
completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA violations, at a cost of $9 million. We believe this
settlement will provide MAP with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions.


Other Contingencies

We are a defendant along with many other refining companies in over forty cases in eleven states alleging methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE") contamination in
groundwater. The plaintiffs generally are water providers or governmental authorities and they allege that refiners, manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing
a defective product and that owners and operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed MTBE to be discharged into the groundwater. Several of these lawsuits allege contamination that is outside of
our marketing area. A few of the cases seek approval as class actions. Many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble damages under a variety of statutes and theories. We stopped producing MTBE at
our refineries in October 2002. The potential impact of these recent cases and future potential similar cases is uncertain. We will defend these cases vigorously.

We
are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive
enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources."

SEC Inquiry Relating to Equatorial Guinea

By letter dated July 15, 2004, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") notified Marathon that it was conducting an inquiry into
payments made to the government of Equatorial Guinea, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial Guinea. This inquiry follows an investigation and public
hearing conducted by the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which reviewed the transactions of various foreign governments, including that of Equatorial Guinea, with Riggs
Bank. The investigation and hearing also reviewed the operations of U.S. oil companies, including Marathon, in Equatorial Guinea. There was no finding in the Subcommittee's report that Marathon
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other applicable laws or regulations. The investigation is ongoing and Marathon is cooperating fully with the SEC inquiry.

Outlook

Capital, Investment and Exploration Budget

We approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of $2.98 billion for 2005. The primary focus of the 2005 budget is to find additional oil and gas
reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen RM&T assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas strategy. The budget includes worldwide production capital spending of $1.219 billion
primarily in U.S, Norway, Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Ireland, and the U.K. The worldwide exploration budget of $364 million includes plans to drill 15 significant exploration wells in the Gulf
of Mexico, Angola, Norway and other areas. Other activities will focus on projects primarily in the United States. The budget includes $804 million for RM&T projects, primarily for refinery
expansion and upgrading projects, as well as investments necessary to meet required low sulfur (Tier II) gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel specifications. The integrated gas
budget of $481 million is primarily for the ongoing construction of the LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The remaining $111 million balance is designated for corporate activities and
capitalized interest.

Exploration and Production

Our six discoveries in 2004 result from our balanced exploration strategy which places greater emphasis on near-term production and lower risk
opportunities, while retaining an appropriate exposure to longer-term options. Major exploration activities, which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those in:

•

Equatorial
Guinea, where we are evaluating development scenarios for the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries on the Alba Block, one of which includes production through the
Alba field infrastructure and the future LNG facility under construction on Bioko Island. We own a 63 percent interest in the Alba Block and serve as operator. We plan to drill one additional
exploration well in 2005 in Equatorial Guinea.

•

Norway,
where Hamsun well results are being analyzed and development scenarios are being examined including a possible tie-back to the Alvheim development. We
own a 65 percent interest in Hamsun and serve as operator. In addition, we acquired four new Norwegian exploration licenses (three operated) in the December 2004 APA License Round. We
now own interests in sixteen licenses in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and plan to drill two to three exploration wells during 2005.


•

Offshore
Angola, where development options for the northeast development area of Block 31, which includes the Plutao, Saturno, Marte and Venus discoveries, are currently
being evaluated. Also on Block 31, the Palas well in the southern portion was recently announced as a discovery and the Ceres well in the central portion has reached total depth and results will be
announced when government approval is received. We own a 10 percent interest in Block 31. On Angola Block 32, in which we own a 30 percent interest, additional drilling will be required
to determine commerciality of the Cola prospect and the results of the Gengibre well will be announced following government approval. We plan to participate in six exploration wells offshore Angola
during 2005.

•

Gulf
of Mexico, where development options for the Neptune unit are being assessed and front end engineering and design is anticipated to result in project sanction in 2005.
We own a 30 percent interest in the Neptune unit. We plan to participate in three to four wells in the Gulf of Mexico during 2005.

During
2004, we continued to make progress in advancing key development projects that will help serve as the basis for our production growth profile in the coming years. Major
development and production activities currently underway or under evaluation include those in:

•

Norway,
where our approved Alvheim PDO will consist of a floating production, storage and offloading ("FPSO") vessel with subsea infrastructure for five drill centers and
associated flow lines. Tendering for all major construction contracts was completed in early 2005, including contracts for FPSO topsides construction and hull modifications. The approved Alvheim PDO
includes the Kneler, Boa and Kameleon fields in which we own a 65 percent interest and serve as operator. A PDO for the nearby Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest, was
submitted by the operator, to the Norwegian Government in December 2004 and approval is expected in 2005. The combined Alvheim/Vilje developments are expected to ramp up production to more than
50,000 boepd during 2007.

•

Equatorial
Guinea, where we continued our expansion programs with the completion and continued ramp-up of production from the condensate expansion project. As of
year-end 2004, gross condensate production averaged approximately 45,800 bpd. At full capacity, the condensate expansion will increase total liquids production to approximately 57,000
gross bpd (32,000 bpd net to Marathon). Our LPG expansion project is on schedule for start-up during the second quarter of 2005. The project is mechanically complete and commissioning is
in progress. When the LPG expansion is completed, gross liquids production will increase to approximately 79,000 bpd (44,500 bpd net) during the second half of 2005.

•

Ireland,
where the An Bord Pleanála announced that it has upheld the Mayo County Council's decision to grant planning permission for the proposed natural gas
terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge, County Mayo, which is to be built to bring gas from the Corrib field ashore. This decision represents a major step forward for the Corrib gas project, in which we own an
18.5 percent interest. Construction began in December and first gas production is targeted for 2007.

•

Russia,
where we expect to drill approximately 70 wells in 2005.

•

Wyoming's
Powder River Basin, where we plan to drill approximately 500 coal bed natural gas wells in 2005.

•

Libya,
where we continue to work with our partners, including the Libyan Government, to finalize the terms of the group's reentry agreement following the lifting of U.S.
sanctions in early 2004. The parties continue to make progress toward a final agreement and we are optimistic that it will be finalized in the near future. We own a 16.33 percent interest in
the approximately 13 million acre Waha Concession.

The
above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of our worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production, future exploration and
drilling activity, the Alvheim/Vilje developments, the LPG expansion project and the Corrib gas project. Some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas and
condensate production, the exploration and drilling activities and the Alvheim development include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of capital available for exploration and
development, occurrence of acquisitions/dispositions of oil and gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards
such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. In addition to the foregoing
factors, the plan for development and operation of the Vilje Field may be affected by delays in obtaining Norwegian regulatory approval. Some factors that could affect the LPG expansion project and
the Corrib gas project include unforeseen problems arising from construction and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. The forward-looking information related to production is based on
certain assumptions, including, among others, presently known physical data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology development, future drilling success,
production experience, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations and operating conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially
from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.


Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Throughout 2004, MAP remained focused on its strategy of leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets, as well as expanding and enhancing its
asset base while controlling costs. The record refinery throughput performance was achieved even though the company had undertaken a significant number of planned turnarounds during the first quarter
of 2004 at the Garyville, Louisiana; Catlettsburg, Kentucky; and Canton, Ohio, refineries. Assuming refining margins remain strong in 2005, we expect MAP's 2005 average crude oil throughput to exceed
that achieved in 2004.

The
Detroit refinery expansion project remains on schedule for completion in late 2005. This project will increase the refinery's crude processing capacity from 74,000 bpd to 100,000 bpd
as well as enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Marathon is loaning MAP the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects.

On
March 18, 2004, we entered into an agreement with Ashland Inc. to acquire its 38 percent interest in MAP, along with a portion of its Valvoline Instant Oil Change
business and its maleic anhydride business. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including favorable private letter rulings from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"),
opinions of outside tax counsel, Ashland shareholder approval, Ashland public debt holder consents, and updated Ashland solvency opinions. With respect to the tax treatment of the transaction,
Marathon and Ashland are discussing with the IRS possible modifications of the transaction that would allow a tax efficient transfer of the MAP interest. Any such modifications would require Marathon
and
Ashland to amend the Master Agreement executed by the parties on March 18, 2004. However, there can be no assurance that an agreement on a modified transaction will be reached. If an agreement
is reached on a modified transaction, it is likely the transaction would close in the second quarter of 2005. For additional information, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to projections of crude oil throughput, the Detroit refinery expansion project, the proposed acquisition of
Ashland's 38 percent interest in MAP and other related businesses and the anticipated effects of private letter rulings from the IRS with respect to the tax treatment of the MAP transaction.
Some factors that could affect crude oil throughput include planned and unplanned refinery maintenance projects, the level of refining margins, and other operating considerations. The Detroit refinery
expansion project may be affected by the availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Some
factors that could affect the completion of the acquisition of Ashland's 38 percent interest in MAP and other related businesses include modifications to the transaction, an adverse ruling from
the IRS regarding certain tax basis issues, opinions of outside tax counsel, Ashland shareholder approval, Ashland public debt holder consents and updated Ashland solvency opinions. The foregoing
factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Integrated Gas

We continued to progress our integrated gas strategy throughout the year. This strategy is designed to complement our exploration and production operations
focusing on accessing low cost stranded natural gas resources and adding value by applying technology and commercial skills to connect those resources to the major consuming markets.

Construction
of the Equatorial Guinea LNG project is on schedule for shipment of first cargoes of LNG in late 2007. This project is expected to be one of the lowest cost LNG operations
in the Atlantic basin with an all-in LNG operating, capital and feedstock cost of approximately $1 per million British thermal units ("mmbtu") at the loading flange of the LNG plant.
Efforts are underway to acquire additional gas supply and expand the utilization of this LNG facility above and beyond the contract to supply 3.4 million metric tons per year to BG Gas
Marketing Ltd. for 17 years. We also are seeking additional natural gas supplies in the area to expand the capacity and life of this plant and that could lead to the development of a
second LNG train.

Under
the five year BP supply agreement, we will begin taking delivery of LNG at the Elba Island, Georgia, LNG regasification terminal during the second half of 2005. At the Elba Island
terminal, we hold rights to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf of natural gas per year through 2021, with an option to extend for five years. This supply agreement with BP enables us to fully utilize our
capacity rights at Elba Island during the period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this capacity to commercialize other stranded gas resources beyond the term of the BP
contract. We continue to actively seek LNG cargoes before the start of deliveries from BP.


In
2005, we plan to continue exploring and investing in gas technology research, including GTL technology, which was successfully applied in the Catoosa GTL demonstration plant in 2004.
In addition to GTL, we are
researching and developing expertise in methanol to power, gas to gasoline and compressed natural gas technologies.

The
above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction of a LNG project. Factors that could affect the proposed LNG project and related
facilities include unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply,
environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to
differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Corporate Matters

In 2004, as part of ongoing business transformation programs, we implemented two outsourcing agreements to achieve further business process improvements and cost
reductions. It is anticipated that these programs will result in total pretax charges of approximately $70 million. Of these charges, $24 million was recorded in 2003 and
$43 million was recorded in 2004, including net settlement and curtailment gains of $10 million in 2003 and losses of $20 million in 2004, on employee benefit plans. Projected
savings from the business transformation programs are expected to benefit all business segments.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

During December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS
No. 123R") as a revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation". This statement requires entities to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. In 2003, Marathon adopted the fair value
method for grants made, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003. Accordingly, management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material affect on results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. This statement is effective for Marathon on July 1, 2005. Marathon has not yet determined whether to adopt this standard earlier than the effective
date.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Management Opinion Concerning Derivative Instruments

Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices, interest
rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.

We
use commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to
the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials.

Our
strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. We will use a
variety of derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk in our different businesses. As market conditions
change, we evaluate our risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices.

Our
E&P segment primarily uses commodity derivative instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on portions of our future production when deemed advantageous to do so. We
also use financial derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure on foreign currency denominated capital investment expenditures, operating expenses and foreign tax
payments.

Our
RM&T segment uses commodity derivative instruments:

•

to
mitigate the price risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined
into salable petroleum products,

•

to
manage the price risk associated with anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use,

•

to
protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and LPG inventories,

•

to
lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers,

•

to
protect against decreases in future crack spreads,

•

to
mitigate price risk associated with freight on crude, feedstocks, and refined product deliveries, and

•

to
take advantage of trading opportunities identified in the commodity markets.

Our
IG segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. We use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on
purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes.

We
use financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposures. As we enter into these derivatives, assessments are made as to the
qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting.

We
believe that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments
could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. We believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or
liquidity.


Commodity Price Risk

Sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ("IFO") of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in commodity
prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, are provided in the following table:

We
remain at risk for future changes in the market value of derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged
item. Effects of these offsets are not reported in the sensitivity analyses. Amounts assume hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent changes in closing commodity prices, excluding basis
swaps, for each open contract position at December 31, 2004 and 2003. We evaluate our portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in
anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. We are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is
reviewed continuously and master netting agreements are used when practical. Changes to the portfolio after December 31, 2004, would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented in
the table.

(b)

Net
open contracts for the combined E&P and IG segments varied throughout 2004, from a low of 1 contract at December 15 to a high of 39,683 contracts at
January 1, and averaged 19,344 for the year. The number of net open contracts for the RM&T segment varied throughout 2004, from a low of 253 contracts at July 7 to a high of 23,138
contracts at October 13, and averaged 11,437 for the year. The derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and, because of these variations in the composition of
the portfolio over time, the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects.

(c)

The
calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated. Gains and losses on options are based on
changes in intrinsic value only.

(d)

The
direction of the price change used in calculating the sensitivity amount for each commodity is based on the largest incremental decrease in IFO when applied to the
derivative commodity instruments used to hedge that commodity.

(e)

Price

(f)

Price
decrease.

E&P Segment

Derivative losses included in the E&P segment were $169 million in 2004 compared to losses of $110 million in 2003 and gains of $34 million in
2002. Additionally, losses from discontinued cash flow hedges of $3 million are included in 2004 segment results, compared to losses of $8 million in 2003 and gains of $23 million
in 2002. The
discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur.

Excluded
from the E&P segment results were losses of $99 million in 2004, losses of $66 million in 2003 and gains of $18 million in 2002 on long-term gas
contracts in the United Kingdom that are accounted for as derivative instruments. For additional information on U.K. gas contracts, see "Estimated Fair Value of Derivative Contracts" on page 31.

At
December 31, 2004, we had no open equity production derivative contracts. We evaluate the commodity price risk of our equity production on an ongoing basis and may enter into
commodity derivative instruments when it is deemed advantageous.


RM&T Segment

We do not attempt to qualify commodity derivative instruments used in our RM&T operations for hedge accounting. As a result, we recognize all changes in the fair
value of derivatives used in our RM&T operations in income, although most of these derivatives have an underlying physical commodity transaction. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices
increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transactions. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying
physical commodity transactions. Derivative gains or losses included in RM&T segment income for each of the last three years are summarized in the following table:

During 2004, using derivative instruments MAP sold crack spreads forward through the fourth quarter 2005 at values higher than the company thought
sustainable in the actual months these contracts expire. Included in the $76 million derivative loss for 2004 noted in the above table for the "Protect crack spread values" strategy was
approximately an $8 million gain due to changes in the fair value of crack-spread derivatives that will expire throughout 2005.

In
addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 41 percent of the first quarter 2005 anticipated natural gas purchases for
refinery use.

IG Segment

We have used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. The underlying physical contract is
for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. Similarly, we will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year) fixed price contracts to market prices in
our ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. Derivative gains included in IG segment income were $17 million in 2004,
compared to gains of $19 million in 2003 and losses of $8 million in 2002. Trading activity in the IG segment resulted in losses of $2 million in 2004, compared to losses of
$7 million in 2003 and gains of $4 million in 2002 and have been included in the aforementioned amounts.

Other Commodity Risk

We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and
the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. For example,
New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") contracts for natural gas are priced
at Louisiana's Henry Hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western United States at prices that do not move in strict correlation with NYMEX prices. If
commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk.
These regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. OTC transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk.

We
are impacted by liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting
position. Due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions.


Interest Rate Risk

We are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the fair value of certain financial instruments. A sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental
effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table:

(b)

See
Note 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for carrying value of instruments.

(c)

For
long-term debt, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of our long-term debt at
December 31, 2004 and 2003. For interest rate swap agreements, this assumes a 10 percent decrease in the effective swap rate at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

(d)

Includes
amounts due within one year.

(e)

Fair
value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments. Therefore,
the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. This sensitivity is illustrated by the $164 million increase in the fair value of
long-term debt assuming a hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates. However, our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our
debt portfolio would unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only if we would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices
above carrying value.

We
have initiated a program to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments. The primary objective of this program is to reduce our
overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio. We have entered into several interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which
effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates. The following table summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the
interest rate swap activity as of December 31, 2004:

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing forward contracts, generally with terms of 365 days or less. The primary objective of
this program is to reduce our exposure to movements in the foreign currency markets by locking in foreign currency rates. At December 31, 2004, the following commodity derivatives were
outstanding. All contracts currently qualify for hedge accounting unless noted.

Credit Risk

We are exposed to significant credit risk from United States Steel arising from the Separation. That exposure is discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations Associated with the Separation of United States Steel" on page 42.

Safe Harbor

These quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management's opinion about risks associated
with the use of derivative instruments. These statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products
and other feedstocks. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.

Management's Responsibilities for Financial Statements

To
the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Marathon Oil Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (Marathon) are the responsibility of management and have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and estimates. The financial
information displayed in other sections of this report is consistent with these financial statements.

Marathon
seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial records by careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division
of responsibility and by communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood throughout the organization.

The
Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed
solely of independent directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by
each of their responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

To
the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

Marathon's
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(f) under
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934). An evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, was conducted under the supervision and the
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the results of this evaluation, Marathon's management concluded that its internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Marathon's
management assessment of the effectiveness of Marathon's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

We
have completed an integrated audit of Marathon Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries' (Marathon) 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing on pages F-4 through F-40 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Marathon
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of Marathon's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Marathon changed its method of accounting for asset retirement costs, stock based compensation and the effects of early
extinguishment of debt in 2003.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Marathon maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our
opinion, Marathon maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by COSO. Marathon's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Marathon's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Principal Accounting Policies

Marathon
is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its
62 percent owned consolidated subsidiary Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP); and integrated gas.

Principles applied in consolidation

–  These consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the businesses comprising Marathon.

The
assets and liabilities of MAP are consolidated in these financial statements and minority interest representing 38 percent of the carrying value of the net assets of MAP has
been recognized. Under certain circumstances, the MAP Limited Liability Company Agreement requires unanimous approval of certain matters brought to the MAP Board of Managers. Marathon does not believe
that the rights of the minority shareholder of MAP are substantive because the likelihood of those rights being triggered is remote.

Investments
in variable interest entities ("VIE") in which Marathon is the primary beneficiary are consolidated. Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited ("EGHoldings"), in which Marathon
holds a 75 percent interest and Compania Nacional de Petroleos de Guinea Ecuatorial ("GEPetrol") holds a 25 percent interest, is a VIE and Marathon is its primary beneficiary. EGHoldings
was formed for the purpose of constructing and operating a liquefied natural gas ("LNG") plant, and as of December 31, 2004, total expenditures of $551 million, including
$524 million of capital expenditures, related to the LNG project have been incurred.

Investments
in unincorporated oil and gas joint ventures and undivided interests in certain pipelines, gas processing plants and LNG tankers are consolidated on a pro rata basis.

Investments
in entities over which Marathon has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are carried at Marathon's share of net
assets plus loans and advances. Differences in the basis of
the investment and the separate net asset value of the investee, if any, are amortized into income in accordance with the remaining useful life of the underlying assets.

Investments
in companies whose stock is publicly traded are carried at market value. The difference between the cost of these investments and market value is recorded in other
comprehensive income (net of tax). Investments in companies whose stock has no readily determinable fair value are carried at cost.

Income
from equity method investments represents Marathon's proportionate share of income from equity method investments. Other income includes dividend income from other investments.
Dividend income is recognized when dividend payments are received.

Gains
or losses from a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary or an unconsolidated investee are recognized in the period of change.

Use of estimates

–  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
year-end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property, plant and equipment,
goodwill, intangibles, equity method investments and non-exchange traded derivative contracts; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets;
environmental remediation liabilities; liabilities for potential tax deficiencies and potential litigation claims and settlements; assets and obligations related to employee benefits; and the
classification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

Income per common share

–  Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share assumes exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of convertible debt and preferred securities, provided the
effect is not antidilutive.

Segment information

–  Marathon's operations consist of three reportable operating segments:

•

Exploration
and Production ("E&P") – explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis;

•

Refining,
Marketing and Transportation ("RM&T") – refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, the upper
Great Plains and southeastern United States through MAP; and

•

Integrated
Gas ("IG") – markets and transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, on a worldwide basis.

Management
has determined that these are its operating segments because these are the components of Marathon (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned
and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by Marathon's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated and assess
performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is responsible for allocating resources to and assessing performance of
Marathon's operating segments. Information on assets by segment is not provided because it is not reviewed by the CODM. The CODM is also

F-8

the
manager over each of the segments. In this role, he is responsible for allocating resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of components within the segments, and assessing the
performance of the components. The components within the segments that are separately reviewed and assessed by the CODM in his role as segment manager are aggregable with other components in the same
segment because they have similar economic characteristics.

Segment
income represents income from operations allocable to operating segments. Marathon corporate general and administrative costs are not allocated to operating segments. These costs
primarily consist of employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other related costs associated with corporate activities. Inventory market valuation
adjustments, noncash gains (losses) on two long-term natural gas sales contracts in the United Kingdom accounted for as derivative instruments and gains (losses) on ownership changes in
subsidiaries also are not allocated to operating segments. Additionally, certain nonoperating or infrequently occurring items are not allocated to operating segments (see segment income reconcilement
table on page F-20).

Effective
January 1, 2004, Marathon realigned its segment reporting to report a new business segment, Integrated Gas. This segment includes Marathon's LNG operations in Alaska and
Equatorial Guinea, methanol operations in Equatorial Guinea, the Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification activities and certain other natural gas marketing and transportation activities, along with
expenses related to the continued development of an integrated gas business. These activities were previously reported in the Other Energy Related Businesses ("OERB") segment, which has been
eliminated. Crude oil marketing and transportation activities and costs associated with a gas-to-liquids ("GTL") demonstration plant, previously reported in
OERB, are now reported in the E&P segment. Refined product transportation activities not included in MAP, also previously reported in OERB, are now reported in the RM&T segment. The 2003 and 2002
information has been restated to report the new segment structure.

Revenue recognition

–  Revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services are
provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Costs associated with revenues are recorded in costs of revenues.

Marathon
recognizes revenues from the production of oil and gas when title is transferred. In the United States and certain international locations, production volumes of liquid
hydrocarbons or natural gas are sold immediately and transported via pipeline. At other international locations, production volumes may be stored as inventory and sold at a later time. Royalties on
the production of oil and gas are either paid in cash or settled through the delivery of volumes. Marathon includes royalties in its revenue and cost of revenues when settlement of royalties is paid
in cash, while settlement of royalties based on the delivery of volumes are excluded from revenue and cost of revenues.

Rebates
from vendors are recognized as a reduction to cost of revenues when the initiating transaction occurs. Incentives that are derived from contractual provisions are accrued based
on past experience and recognized in cost of revenues.

Marathon
follows the sales method of accounting for gas production imbalances and would recognize a liability if the existing proved reserves were not adequate to cover the current
imbalance situation.

Matching buy/sell transactions

–  Matching buy/sell transactions are arrangements in which
Marathon agrees to buy a specific quantity and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products to be delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing to sell a specified quantity and
quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products at a different
location, usually with the same counterparty. All matching buy/sell transactions are settled in cash and are recorded in both revenues and costs of revenues as separate sales and purchase
transactions, or on a "gross" basis. The commodity purchased and the commodity sold generally are similar in nature.

In
a typical buy/sell transaction, Marathon enters into a contract to sell a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a specified location and date to a particular
counterparty, and simultaneously agrees to buy a particular grade of crude oil or refined product at a different location on the same or another specified date, typically from the same counterparty.
The value of the purchased volumes rarely equals the sales value of the sold volumes. The value differences between purchases and sales are primarily due to 1) grade/quality differentials,
2) location differentials or 3) timing differences, in those instances when the purchase and sale do not occur in the same month.

For
the E&P segment, Marathon enters into matching buy/sell transactions to reposition crude oil from one market center to another in order to maximize the value received for Marathon's
crude oil production. For the RM&T segment, Marathon enters into crude oil matching buy/sell transactions to secure the most profitable refinery supply. Also, for the RM&T segment, Marathon enters
into refined product matching buy/sell transactions to meet projected customer demands and to secure the required volumes in the most cost-effective manner.

The
characteristics of Marathon's matching buy/sell transactions include gross invoicing between Marathon and its counterparties and cash settlement of the transactions. Nonperformance
by one party to deliver generally does not relieve the other party's obligation to perform. Both transactions require physical delivery of the product. The risks and rewards of ownership are evidenced
by title transfer, assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling, credit risk, counterparty nonperformance risk and the fact that Marathon has the primary obligation to perform.

Marathon
believes matching buy/sell transactions are monetary in nature and thus outside the scope of APB Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("APB
No. 29"). Additionally, Marathon has evaluated EITF No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent" ("EITF No. 99-19") and,
based on that evaluation, management believes that the recording of these transactions on a gross basis is appropriate.

F-9

The
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") is currently considering Issue No. 04-13, "Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty," ("EITF
No. 04-13"), which relates to transactions in which an entity sells inventory to another entity in the same line of business from which it also purchases inventory. The following
questions have been raised regarding the accounting for these types of transactions and are expected to be addressed by the EITF:

(a)

Under
what circumstances should two or more transactions with the same counterparty (counterparties) be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of APB
No. 29?

(b)

If
nonmonetary transactions within the scope of APB No. 29 involve inventory, are there any circumstances under which the transactions should be recognized at fair value?

The
EITF has not yet addressed the first question. The EITF discussed the second question at its November 2004 meeting without reaching any consensus. If the EITF were to
determine that these transactions should be accounted for as monetary transactions on a gross basis, no change in Marathon's accounting policy for matching buy/sell transactions would be necessary. If
the EITF were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions qualifying for fair value recognition and require a net presentation of such transactions, the
amounts of revenues and cost
of revenues associated with matching buy/sell transactions would be netted in Marathon's consolidated statement of income, but there would be no effect on income from operations, net income or cash
flows from operations. If the EITF were to determine that these transactions should be accounted for as nonmonetary transactions not qualifying for fair value recognition, these amounts of revenues
and cost of revenues would be netted in Marathon's consolidated statement of income and there could be an impact on income from operations and net income related to the timing of the ultimate sale of
product purchased in the "buy" side of the matching buy/sell transaction. However, management does not believe any impact would be material. There would be no impact on cash flows from operations as a
result of this accounting treatment.

Cash and cash equivalents

–  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and
investments in highly liquid debt instruments with maturities generally of three months or less.

Inventories

–  Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is
determined primarily under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

The
inventory market valuation reserve results when the recorded LIFO cost basis of crude oil and refined products inventories exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is decreased when
market prices increase and inventories turn over and is increased when market prices decrease. Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve result in noncash charges or credits to costs and
expenses.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

–  Trade accounts receivable are
recorded at the invoiced amount and only proprietary credit card receivables bear interest. Accounts receivable consists mainly of trade receivables. Account balances are charged to bad debt expense
when it is probable the receivable will not be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in Marathon's existing proprietary credit
card receivables and other receivables. Marathon determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience and proprietary credit card sales. Marathon reviews the allowance for
doubtful accounts quarterly and past due balances over 180 days are reviewed individually for collectibility.

Traditional derivative instruments

–  Marathon uses commodity-based derivatives and financial
instrument related derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. As market conditions change, Marathon may use selective derivative
instruments that assume market risk in exchange for an upfront premium. Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps and combinations of options, including written or net written
options, related to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, future interest expense and certain business
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income, in revenues, other income, costs of revenues or net interest and
other financing costs, unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows or certain foreign currency exposures. Cash flows related to the use of derivatives are classified in operating
activities with the underlying hedged transaction.

For
derivatives qualifying as hedges of future cash flows or certain foreign currency exposures, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in a component of
stockholders' equity called other comprehensive income and then reclassified to income, in revenues, costs of revenues or net interest and other financing costs, when the underlying anticipated
transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in income as it occurs. For discontinued cash flow hedges, prospective changes in the fair value of the derivative are
recognized in income. Any gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income at the time a hedge is discontinued continues to be deferred until the original forecasted transaction occurs. However,
if it is determined that the likelihood of the original forecasted transaction occurring is no longer probable, the entire gain or loss accumulated in other comprehensive income is immediately
reclassified into income.

For
derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of recognized assets, liabilities or firm commitments, changes in the fair value of both the hedged item and the related derivative
are recognized immediately in income, in revenues,

F-10

costs
of revenues or net interest and other financing costs, with an offsetting effect included in the basis of the hedged item. The net effect is to report in income the extent to which the hedge is
not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

For
derivative instruments that are classified as trading, changes in the fair value are recognized immediately in other income. Any premium received is amortized into income based on
the underlying settlement terms of the derivative position. All related effects of a trading strategy, including physical settlement of the derivative position, are recognized in other income.

Nontraditional derivative instruments

–  Certain contracts involving the purchase or sale of
commodities are not considered normal purchases or normal sales under generally accepted accounting principles and are required to be accounted for as derivative instruments. Marathon refers to such
contracts as "nontraditional derivative instruments" because, unlike traditional derivative instruments, nontraditional derivative instruments have not been entered into to manage a risk exposure.
Such contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in income as revenues or cost of revenues.

In
the E&P segment, two long-term natural gas delivery commitment contracts in the United Kingdom are classified as nontraditional derivative instruments. These contracts
contain pricing provisions that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity and therefore must be accounted for as derivative instruments.

In
the RM&T segment, certain physical commodity contracts are classified as nontraditional derivative instruments because certain volumes under these contracts are physically netted at
particular delivery locations. The netting process causes all contracts at that delivery location to be considered derivative instruments. Other physical contracts that involve flash title are also
accounted for as nontraditional derivative instruments. Marathon has made an election under generally accepted accounting principles to treat contracts involving flash title as derivative instruments.

Property, plant and equipment

–  Marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for
oil and gas producing activities. Costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells
are capitalized. Costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed. Costs
incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion
as a producing well and (b) Marathon is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a
determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following the completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. The status of suspended well costs is
monitored continuously and reviewed not less than quarterly.

In
February 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") proposed FASB Staff Position FAS 19-a, "Accounting for Suspended Well Costs" ("FSP
FAS 19-a"), which would amend the guidance for suspended well costs in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 19, "Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies" ("SFAS No. 19"). SFAS No. 19 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If
the well has found proved reserves, the capitalized costs become part of the entity's wells, equipment, and facilities; if, however, the well has not found proved reserves, the capitalized costs of
drilling the well are expensed. If classification of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of the drilling in an area requiring a major capital expenditure, paragraph 31(a) of SFAS
No. 19 provides that the cost should continue to be carried as an asset provided that (1) there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well if the
required capital expenditure is made and (2) drilling of the additional exploratory well is underway or firmly planned for the near future. If either of those two criteria is not met, SFAS
No. 19 indicates the entity should expense the exploratory well costs. For all other exploratory wells not addressed in paragraph 31(a), paragraph 31(b) provides that the
capitalized
costs should be charged to expense if the reserves cannot be classified as proved after a year following the completion of exploratory drilling. Questions have arisen in practice about the application
of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles. The issue is whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well
costs beyond one year other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future. The proposed
FSP FAS 19-a would allow exploratory well costs to continue to be capitalized when (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a
producing well and (b) the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Marathon's current policy is in accordance
with the proposed FSP FAS 19-a. The proposed FSP FAS 19-a also provides for certain disclosures to be made regarding capitalized exploratory well costs.

Capitalized
costs of producing oil and gas properties are depreciated and depleted by the units-of-production method. Support equipment and other property, plant
and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Marathon
evaluates its oil and gas producing properties for impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets
if there is significant shared infrastructure. Impairment of proved properties is required when carrying value exceeds undiscounted future net cash flows based on total proved and
risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down

F-11

to
their fair value, as determined by discounted future net cash flows based on total proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves or, if available, comparable market values.

Marathon
evaluates its unproved property investment for impairment based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an undiscounted future net cash flow approach. Information
such as drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. Impairment expense for unproved oil and gas properties is reported in
exploration expense.

Property,
plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing activities is recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which range from 3 to 42 years.

When
property, plant and equipment depreciated on an individual basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reported in income. Gains on disposal of property, plant
and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as held for sale.
Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment depreciated on a group basis are credited to accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization with no immediate effect on income.

Goodwill

–  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value
of the net assets acquired, primarily from the acquisitions of the Equatorial Guinea interests in 2002 and of Pennaco Energy, Inc. in 2000. Annually, Marathon assesses the carrying amount of
goodwill by testing for impairment. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and other assets and liabilities to reporting units. Marathon has determined the components of the E&P segment have
similar economic characteristics and therefore aggregates the components into a single reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the
reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then the recorded goodwill is impaired down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense.

Intangible assets

–  Intangible assets consists of deferred marketing costs, intangible
contract rights, proprietary information, and unrecognized pension plan prior service costs. The marketing costs incurred in the RM&T segment relate to refurbishment of various branded jobber
locations. These marketing costs are amortized over five to ten years depending on the term of the associated marketing agreement. Additionally, Marathon has intangibles in the IG
segment associated with the acquisition of a contractual right to utilize the Elba Island LNG terminal in Savannah, Georgia. These rights are being amortized over the expected life of the contract.

Major maintenance activities

–  Marathon incurs costs for planned major refinery maintenance
("turnarounds"). Such costs are expensed in the same annual period as incurred; however, estimated annual turnaround costs are recognized in income throughout the year on a pro rata basis.

Environmental remediation liabilities

–  Environmental remediation expenditures are
capitalized if the costs mitigate past or prevent future contamination or if the costs improve environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets. Marathon provides for remediation costs and
penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility
study or the commitment to a formal plan of action. Remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably
fixed and determinable. If recoveries of remediation costs from third parties are probable, a receivable is recorded.

Asset retirement obligations

–  The fair value of asset retirement obligations are recognized
in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. For Marathon, asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing
facilities. Asset retirement obligations include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and
seabed, including those leased. Estimates of these costs are developed for each property based on the type of production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir,
market demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering professionals. Depreciation of capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of asset
retirement obligations are recorded over time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis, while the accretion to be recognized will escalate
over the life of the producing assets. Asset retirement obligations have not been recognized for certain refinery, crude oil and product pipeline and marketing assets because the fair value cannot be
estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation. Additionally, asset retirement obligations have not been recognized for certain of Marathon's international oil and gas
producing facilities as Marathon currently does not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities.

Deferred taxes

–  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases as reported in Marathon's filings with the
respective taxing authority. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on several interrelated factors. These factors include Marathon's expectation to generate sufficient
future taxable income including future foreign source income, tax credits, operating loss carryforwards, and management's intent regarding the permanent reinvestment of the income from certain foreign
subsidiaries.

F-12

Pensions and other postretirement benefits

–  Marathon has noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees, international employees located in Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, and most MAP employees. In addition, several excess benefits
plans exist covering domestic employees within defined regulatory compensation limits. Benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of service and final average pensionable earnings. MAP
also participates in a multiemployer plan that provides coverage for less than 5 percent of its employees. The benefits provided include both pension and health care.

Marathon
also has defined benefit plans for other postretirement benefits covering most employees. Health care benefits are provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major
medical benefit provisions subject to various cost sharing features. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain nonunion and union represented retiree beneficiaries. Other postretirement benefits
have not been prefunded.

Marathon
uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Stock-based compensation

–  The Marathon Oil Corporation 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan (the
"Plan") authorizes the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Marathon to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, cash awards and performance awards to employees.
The Plan also allows Marathon to provide equity compensation to its non-employee directors of its Board of Directors. The Plan was approved by Marathon's shareholders on April 30,
2003. No more than 20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the Plan, and no more than 8,500,000 of those shares may be used for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation
rights. Shares subject to awards that are forfeited, terminated, expire unexercised, settled in cash, exchanged for other awards, tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, withheld to
satisfy tax obligations or otherwise lapse again become available for awards.

The
Plan replaced the 1990 Stock Plan, the Non-Officer Restricted Stock Plan, the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, the deferred stock benefit provision of the
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Senior Executive Officer Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, and the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Prior
Plans"). No new grants will be made from the Prior Plans. Any awards previously granted under the Prior Plans shall continue to vest and/or be exercisable in accordance with their original terms and
conditions.

Stock
options represent the right to purchase shares of stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Certain options are granted with a tandem stock appreciation
right, which allows the recipient to instead elect to receive cash and/or common stock equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of common stock, as determined in accordance with the
plan, over the option price of shares. Most stock options granted under the Plan vest ratably over a three-year period and all expire 10 years from the date they are granted.

Similar
to stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs") represent the right to receive a payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of common stock on the date
the right is exercised over the exercise price. In general, SARs that have been granted under the Plan are settled in shares of stock, vest ratably over a three-year period, and have a
maximum term of 10 years from the date they are granted.

The
Compensation Committee grants stock-based Performance Awards to officers under the Plan. The stock-based Performance Awards represent shares of common stock that are subject to
forfeiture provisions and restrictions on transfer. Those restrictions may be removed if certain pre-established performance measures are met. The stock-based Performance Awards granted
under the Plan generally vest at the end of a thirty-six month performance period if certain pre-established performance targets are achieved.

Marathon
also grants restricted stock to certain non-officer employees under the Plan. Participants are awarded restricted stock by the Salary and Benefits Committee based on
their performance within certain guidelines. The restricted stock awards vest in one-third increments over a three-year period, contingent on the recipient's continued
employment. Prior to vesting, the restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock and receive dividends thereon. The nonvested shares are not transferable and are retained by Marathon
until they vest.

Unearned
compensation is charged to equity when restricted stock and performance shares are granted. Compensation expense is recognized over the balance of the vesting period and is
adjusted if conditions of the restricted stock or performance share grant are not met. Amounts related to the performance-based restricted stock awards under the 1990 Plan are subsequently adjusted
for changes in the market value of the underlying stock.

Marathon
maintains an equity compensation program for its non-employee directors under the Plan. Pursuant to the program, non-employee directors must defer
50 percent of their annual retainers in the form of common stock units. In addition, the program provides each non-employee director with a matching grant of up to 1,000 shares of
common stock on his or her initial election to the board if he or she purchases an equivalent number of shares within 60 days of joining the board.

Effective
January 1, 2003, Marathon applied the fair value based method of accounting to future grants and any modified grants for stock-based compensation. All prior outstanding
and unvested awards continue to be accounted for

F-13

under
the intrinsic value method. The following net income and per share data illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding
and unvested awards in each period.

Concentrations of credit risk

–  Marathon is exposed to credit risk in the
event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing
review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, Marathon has significant exposures to
United States Steel arising from the Separation. These exposures are discussed in Note 3.

Reclassifications

–  Certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been made to conform
to 2004 classifications.

2. New Accounting Standards

Effective
July 1, 2004, Marathon adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 106-2 ("FSP FAS 106-2") "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" ("the Act"). FSP FAS 106-2 includes guidance on recognizing the effects of the new legislation under the various
conditions surrounding the assessment of "actuarial equivalence." Marathon has determined, based on available regulatory guidance, that the postretirement plans' prescription drug benefits are
actuarially equivalent to the Medicare "Part D" benefit under the Act. The subsidy-related reduction at July 1, 2004 in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the Marathon and
MAP postretirement plans are $44 million and $49 million. The combined favorable pretax effect of the subsidy-related reduction for 2004 on the measurement of the net periodic
postretirement benefit cost related to service cost, interest cost and actuarial gain amortization, is $7 million.

Effective
July 1, 2004, Marathon adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 142-2, "Application of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to
Oil- and Gas-Producing Entities" ("FSP FAS 142-2"). FSP FAS 142-2 states drilling and mineral rights of oil- and
gas-producing entities are excluded from Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), and accordingly, should
not be classified as intangible assets rather than oil and gas properties. The adoption of FSP FAS 142-2 did not have an effect on Marathon's financial position, cash flows or
results of operations.

Effective
December 21, 2004, Marathon adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 109-1, "Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the
Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP FAS 109-1"). FSP FAS 109-1 states the deduction, signed
into law by the President on October 22, 2004, of up to 9 percent (when fully phased-in) of the lesser of (a) "qualified production activities income," as defined in
the Act, or (b) taxable income (after the deduction for the utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards) should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement 109.
Accordingly, Marathon will treat the deduction as a permanent difference in the years taken.

F-14

Effective
December 21, 2004, Marathon adopted FASB Staff Position FAS 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision
within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP FAS 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) introduces a special one-time dividends received
deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided certain criteria are met. FSP FAS 109-2 states an enterprise is allowed time beyond the
financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying Statement 109. Marathon does not
intend to repatriate foreign earnings due to the cash commitments for foreign capital projects.

In
the second quarter of 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 "Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS No. 145"). Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the provisions relating to
the classification of the effects of early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of income. As a result, losses of $53 million from the early extinguishment of debt in 2002,
which were previously reported as an extraordinary item (net of tax of $20 million), have been reclassified into income before income taxes. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 had no impact on
net income for 2002.

Effective
January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123"). Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS
No. 148"), an amendment of SFAS No. 123, provides alternative methods for the transition of the accounting for stock-based compensation from the intrinsic value method to the fair value
method. Marathon has applied the fair value method to grants made, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003. The impact on Marathon's 2003 net income was not materially different than
under previous accounting standards.

Effective
January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"). The
transition adjustment related to adopting SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003, was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect on net income
of adopting SFAS No. 143 was a net favorable effect of $4 million, net of tax of $4 million. At the time of adoption, total assets increased $120 million, and total
liabilities increased $116 million. The amounts recognized on adoption are based on numerous estimates and assumptions, including future retirement costs, future recoverable quantities of oil
and gas, future inflation rates and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.

Since
the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"), as amended by
SFAS Nos. 137 and 138, the FASB has issued several interpretations. As a result, Marathon has recognized in income the effect of changes in the fair value of two long-term natural gas
sales contracts in the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2002, Marathon recognized a favorable cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $13 million, net of tax of
$7 million.

3. Information about United States Steel

The Separation

–  Prior to December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of
common stock: USX- Marathon Group common stock ("Common Stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon's energy business, and USX – U.S. Steel Group
common stock ("Steel Stock"), which was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon's steel business. On December 31, 2001, in a tax-free distribution to holders of Steel Stock,
Marathon exchanged the common stock of United States Steel for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis ("the Separation").

In
connection with the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel entered into a number of agreements, including:

Financial Matters Agreement

–  Marathon and United States Steel have
entered into a Financial Matters Agreement that provides for United States Steel's assumption of certain industrial revenue bonds and certain other financial obligations of Marathon. The Financial
Matters Agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for Marathon's discharge from any remaining liability under any of the
assumed industrial revenue bonds.

Under
the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase
options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases, other
than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases.

United
States Steel is the sole general partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P. ("Clairton 1314B"), which owns certain cokemaking facilities formerly owned by United States Steel.
Marathon has guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of United States Steel under the partnership documents. The Financial Matters Agreement requires United States Steel to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from its obligations under this guarantee. United States Steel may dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including if it is required to
fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has indemnified the limited
partners for certain income tax exposures.

F-15

The
Financial Matters Agreement requires Marathon to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a
default or the acceleration of the payment on the assumed obligations.

United
States Steel's obligations to Marathon under the Financial Matters Agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel's accounts payable and other
general unsecured obligations. The Financial Matters Agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security
interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without Marathon's consent.

Tax Sharing Agreement

–  Marathon and United States Steel have entered
into a Tax Sharing Agreement that reflects each party's rights and obligations relating to payments and refunds of income, sales, transfer and other taxes that are attributable to periods beginning
prior to and including the Separation Date and taxes resulting from transactions effected in connection with the Separation.

The
Tax Sharing Agreement incorporates the general tax sharing principles of the former tax allocation policy. In general, Marathon and United States Steel, will make payments between
them such that, with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Separation Date, the amount of taxes to be paid by
each of Marathon and United States Steel will be determined, subject to certain adjustments, as if the former groups each filed their own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return. The Tax Sharing
Agreement also provides for payments between Marathon and United States Steel for certain tax adjustments that may be made after the Separation. Other provisions address, but are not limited to, the
handling of tax audits, settlements and return filing in cases where both Marathon and United States Steel have an interest in the results of these activities.

In
2004 and 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax sharing agreement, Marathon paid $3 million and $16 million to United States Steel in connection with the
settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of the consolidated federal income tax returns of USX Corporation for the years 1992 through 1994. Included in discontinued operations in 2003 is an
$8 million adjustment to the liabilities to United States Steel under this tax sharing agreement.

Relationship Between Marathon and United States Steel After the Separation

–  As a result of
the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest in the other. Thomas J. Usher is the non-executive chairman of the board of
both companies, and as of December 31, 2004, four of the ten remaining members of Marathon's board of directors are also directors of United States Steel.

Sales
to United States Steel in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $30 million, $31 million and $14 million, primarily for natural gas. Purchases from United States Steel in
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $27 million, $14 million and $12 million, primarily for raw materials. Management believes that transactions with United States Steel were conducted under
terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. Marathon reimbursed United States Steel $3 million in both 2004 and 2002 for the payment of benefits to retirees, including Mr. Usher,
under United States Steel's 2001 plan of reorganization.

In
2002, Marathon cancelled the unvested restricted stock awards held by certain former officers and provided each with an appropriate cash settlement. The total cost of the settlement
was $5 million.

Amounts Receivable from or Payable to United States Steel Arising from the Separation

–  As
previously discussed, Marathon remains primarily obligated for certain financings for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the Separation. When United
States Steel makes payments on the principal of these financings, both the receivable and the obligation will be reduced.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, amounts receivable or payable to United States Steel were included in the balance sheet as follows:

5. Business Combinations

On
May 12, 2003, Marathon acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation ("KMOC") for $285 million, including the assumption of $31 million in debt. KMOC is currently evaluating or
developing nine oil fields in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of western Siberia in the Russian Federation. Results of operations for 2003 include the results of KMOC from May 12, 2003. The
allocation of purchase price is final. There was no goodwill associated with the purchase.

The
following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price of KMOC to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

During 2002, in two separate transactions, Marathon acquired interests in the Alba Field offshore Equatorial Guinea, West Africa, and certain other
related assets.

On
January 3, 2002, Marathon acquired certain interests from CMS Energy Corporation for $1.005 billion. Marathon acquired three entities that own a combined
52.4 percent working interest in the Alba Production Sharing Contract and a net 43.2 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant through an equity method
investee. Additionally, Marathon acquired a 45.0 percent net interest in an onshore methanol production plant through an equity method investee. Results of operations for 2002 include the
results of the interests acquired from CMS Energy from January 3, 2002.

On
June 20, 2002, Marathon acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Globex Energy, Inc. ("Globex") for $155 million. Globex owned an additional
10.9 percent working interest in the Alba Production Sharing Contract and an additional net 9.0 percent interest in the onshore liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. Globex also held
oil and gas interests offshore Australia, which were sold on October 28, 2003. Results of operations include the results of the interests acquired from Globex from June 20, 2002.

The
CMS and Globex allocations of purchase price are final. The goodwill arising from the allocations was $175 million, which was assigned to the E&P segment. Significant factors
that resulted in the recognition of goodwill include: the ability to acquire an established business with an assembled workforce and a proven track record and a strategic acquisition in a core
geographic area.

Additionally,
the purchase price allocated to equity method investments was $224 million higher than the underlying net assets of the investees. This excess will be amortized over
the expected useful life of the underlying assets except for $81 million of goodwill relating to equity method investments.

6. Discontinued Operations

On
October 1, 2003, Marathon sold its exploration and production operations in western Canada for $612 million. This divestiture decision was made as part of Marathon's strategic plan to
rationalize noncore oil and gas properties. The results of these operations have been reported separately as discontinued operations in Marathon's Consolidated Statement of Income. The sale resulted
in a gain of $278 million, including a tax benefit of $8 million, which has been reported in discontinued operations. Revenues applicable to the discontinued operations totaled
$188 million and $165 million for 2003 and 2002. Pretax income or loss from discontinued operations was income of $66 million for 2003 and a loss of $4 million for 2002.
During 2004, the final working capital adjustment was determined, which resulted in an additional gain of $4 million and is reported in discontinued operations.

Marathon
expects to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets. In addition, the ability to realize the benefit of
foreign tax credits is based on certain assumptions concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices), income generated from foreign sources and Marathon's tax
profile in the years that such credits may be claimed.

The consolidated tax returns of Marathon for the years 1998 through 2003 are under various stages of audit and administrative review by the IRS.
Marathon believes it has made adequate provision for income taxes and interest which may become payable for years not yet settled.

Pretax
income from continuing operations included amounts attributable to foreign sources of $534 million in 2004, $453 million in 2003 and $372 million in 2002.

Undistributed
income of certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2004, amounted to $687 million. No provision for deferred U.S. income taxes has been made
for these subsidiaries because Marathon intends to permanently reinvest such income in those foreign operations. If such income were not permanently reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
$241 million would have been required.

See
Note 3 for a discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement between Marathon and United States Steel.

11. Business Transformation

During
2003, Marathon implemented an organizational realignment plan that included streamlining Marathon's business processes and services, realigning reporting relationships to reduce costs across
all organizations, consolidating organizations in Houston and reducing the workforce. During 2004, Marathon entered into two outsourcing agreements to achieve further business process improvements and
cost reductions.

During
2004 and 2003, Marathon recorded $43 million and $24 million of costs as general and administrative expenses related to these business transformation programs. These
charges included employee severance and benefit costs related to the elimination of approximately 700 regular employee positions, relocation costs, net benefit plans settlement and curtailment losses
and fixed asset related costs.

The

acquisition costs were estimated to exceed the LIFO inventory values at December 31, 2004 and 2003, by approximately $1,294 million and $655 million. Cost of revenues was reduced
and income from operations was increased by $4 million in 2004, $11 million in 2003, and less than $1 million in 2002 as a result of liquidations of LIFO inventories.

Marathon's carrying value of its equity method investments is $258 million higher than the underlying net assets of investees. This basis
difference is being amortized into income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying net assets.

Dividends
and partnership distributions received from equity investees (excluding distributions that represented a return of capital previously contributed) were $127 million in
2004, $175 million in 2003 and $109 million in 2002.

On
June 30, 2003, Marathon Oil Corporation and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. ("Kinder Morgan") dissolved MKM Partners L.P. which had oil and gas production operations in the
Permian Basin of Texas. Marathon held an 85 percent noncontrolling interest in the partnership. Prior to the dissolution of the partnership, Kinder Morgan acquired MKM Partners L.P.'s
12.75 percent interest in the SACROC unit for an undisclosed amount. The partnership recorded a loss on the disposal of SACROC of $19 million, of which Marathon's share was
$17 million. Also prior to the dissolution, Marathon recorded a $107 million impairment of its investment in MKM Partners L.P. due to an other-than-temporary
decline in the fair value of the investment. The total loss recognized by Marathon related to the dissolution of MKM Partners L.P. was $124 million. The partnership's interest in the Yates
field was distributed to Marathon and Kinder Morgan on dissolution.

related amounts in accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization of $6 million and $2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

On
November 3, 2003, Marathon sold its 42.45 percent interest in the Yates field and its 100 percent interest in the Yates gathering system to Kinder Morgan for
$229 million and recognized a loss of $8 million. This divestiture decision

F-24

was
made as part of Marathon's strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties. The Yates field and gathering system consisted of assets of $240 million of property, plant and
equipment and asset retirement obligations of $3 million.

During
2002, Marathon acquired additional interests in coalbed natural gas assets in the Powder River Basin of northern Wyoming and southern Montana from XTO Energy, Inc. ("XTO")
in exchange for certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. Additionally, 100 million cubic feet per day of long-term gas transportation capacity was
released to Marathon by the original owner of the Powder River Basin interests. On July 1, 2002, Marathon completed this transaction by selling its production interests in the San Juan Basin of
New Mexico to XTO for $42 million. Marathon recognized a gain of $24 million in 2002 related to this transaction.

(a)

The
fair value and carrying value of derivative instruments are the same. The fair value amounts for OTC positions are determined using option-pricing models or dealer
quotes. The fair values of exchange-traded positions are based on market quotes derived from major exchanges. The fair value of interest rate and foreign currency swaps is based on dealer quotes.
Marathon's consolidated balance sheet is reported on a net asset/(liability) basis by brokerage firm, as permitted by the master netting agreements.

(b)

There
was no ineffectiveness associated with fair value hedges for 2004 or 2003 because the hedging instrument and the existing firm commitment contracts are priced on
the same underlying index. Certain derivative instruments used in the fair value hedges mature between 2005 and 2008.

(c)

The
ineffective portion of changes in the fair value for cash flow hedges, on a before tax basis, during 2004 and 2003 was $1 million and less than
$1 million. In addition, during 2004 and 2003, losses of $3 million and $8 million were recognized in revenues as the result of a discontinuation of a portion of a cash flow hedge
related to natural gas and crude oil production. Of the $12 million recorded in OCI as of December 31, 2004, $2 million is expected to be reclassified to income in 2005.

(d)

The
contract price under the U.K. long-term natural gas contracts is reset annually and is indexed to a basket of costs of living and energy commodity
indices for the previous twelve months. The fair value of these contracts is determined by applying the difference between the contract price and the U.K. forward gas strip price to the expected sales
volumes under these contracts for the next eighteen months. The eighteen-month period represents approximately ninety percent of market liquidity in that region.

(e)

Certain
physical commodity contracts are classified as nontraditional derivative instruments because certain volumes covered by these contracts are physically netted at
particular delivery locations. Additionally, other physical contracts that involve flash title are accounted for as nontraditional derivative instruments.

(f)

The
fair value of OTC interest rate swaps exclude accrued interest amounts not yet settled. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, accrued interest approximated
$4 million and $7 million. The net fair value of the OTC interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 of a $10 million loss and a $4 million gain, is
included in long-term debt (see Note 20).

Fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities approximates carrying value due to the short-term
maturity of the instruments. Fair value of investments and long-term receivables was based on discounted cash flows or other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of
long-term debt instruments was based on market prices where available or current borrowing rates available for financings with similar terms and maturities. Fair value of the receivables
from United States Steel was estimated using market prices for United States Steel debt assuming the industrial revenue bonds are redeemed on or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation per the
Financial Matters Agreement.

19. Short-Term Debt

Certain
banks provide Marathon with uncommitted short-term lines of credit totaling $200 million bearing interest at short-term market rates determined at the time of a
request for borrowings. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against these lines of credit.

MAP
has a $190 million revolving credit agreement with Ashland that terminates in March 2005, as discussed in Note 4. Pursuant to the terms of Marathon's agreement
to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in MAP currently held by Ashland (see Note 29), MAP effectively was restricted from borrowing from Ashland under this facility after
September 30, 2004.

Marathon
has a $1.5 billion 5-year revolving credit agreement and MAP has a $500 million 5-year revolving credit facility, both of
which terminate in May 2009. Interest on these facilities is based on defined short-term market rates. During the term of the agreements, Marathon is obligated to pay a variable
facility fee on total commitments, which at December 31, 2004 was 0.125%. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings against these facilities. Commercial paper is supported by the
unused and available credit on the Marathon 5-year facility and, accordingly, is classified as long-term debt.

(b)

These
notes contain a make-whole provision allowing Marathon the right to repay the debt at a premium to market price.

(c)

United
States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment of $472 million of these obligations.

(d)

This
sale-leaseback financing arrangement relates to a lease of a slab caster at United States Steel's Fairfield Works facility in Alabama with a term
through 2012. Marathon is the primary obligor under this lease. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has assumed responsibility for all obligations under this lease. This lease
is an amortizing financing with a final maturity of 2012, subject to additional extensions.

(e)

This
obligation relates to a lease of equipment at United States Steel's Clairton Works cokemaking facility in Pennsylvania with a term through 2012. Marathon is the

Expected Long-Term Return on Plan Assets

U.S. Plans

Historical
markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market
principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and
stock yields. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

International Plans

The
overall expected long-term return on plan assets is derived using the expected returns on the different asset classes, individual asset classes, weighted by holdings as
of year end. The long term rate of return on equity investments is assumed to be 2.5 percent greater than the yield on local government stock. Expected returns on debt securities are taken
directly at market yields and cash is taken at the local currency base rate.

Plan Investment Policies and Strategies

U.S. Plans

The
investment policy reflects the funded status of the plan and the future ability of the Company to make further contributions. Historical performance results and future expectations
suggest that common stocks will provide higher total investment returns than fixed-income securities over a long-term investment horizon. As a result, equity investments will likely
continue to exceed 50 percent of the value of the fund. Accordingly, bond and other fixed income investments will comprise the remainder of the fund. Short term investments shall reflect the
liquidity requirements for making pension payments. The plans' targeted asset allocation is comprised of 75 percent equities and 25 percent debt securities. Management of the plans'
assets is delegated to the United States Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund. The fund manager has discretion to move away from the target allocations based upon the manager's judgment as to current
confidence or concern for the capital markets. Investments are diversified by industry and type, limited by grade and maturity. The policy prohibits investments in any securities in the steel industry
and allows derivatives subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset and
liability studies.

International Plans

The
objective of the investment policy is to achieve a long-term return which is consistent with assumptions made by the actuary in determining the funding requirements of
the plans. The target asset allocation of approximately 75 percent equities and 25 percent debt securities and the unitized pool approach meets this objective and controls the various
risks to which the plans assets are exposed, including matching the timing of estimated future obligations to the maturities of the plans' assets. The day-to-day management of
the plans' assets are delegated to several professional investment managers. The spread of assets by type and the investment managers' policies on investing in individual securities within each type
provides adequate diversification of investments. The use of derivatives by the investment managers is permitted and plan specific, subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance and risk is
measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and liability studies.

Cash Flows

Contributions

Both
MAP and Marathon's foreign subsidiaries expect to make contributions to their funded pension plans in 2005 approximating $127 million and $31 million, respectively.
Marathon is not required to make a cash contribution to its funded domestic pension plan in 2005. Cash contributions to be paid from the general assets of the company for both the unfunded pension and
postretirement benefit plans are expected to be approximately $2 million and $34 million in 2005.

In connection with past sales of various plants and operations, Marathon assigned and the purchasers assumed certain leases of major equipment used
in the divested plants and operations of United States Steel. In the event of a default by any of the purchasers, United States Steel has assumed these obligations; however, Marathon remains primarily
obligated for payments under these leases. Minimum lease payments under these operating lease obligations of $42 million have been included above and an equal amount has been reported as
sublease rentals.

Of
the $166 million present value of net minimum capital lease payments, $122 million was related to obligations assumed by United States Steel under the Financial Matters
Agreement. Of the $363 million total minimum operating lease payments, $13 million was assumed by United States Steel under the Financial Matters Agreement.

During
2003, Marathon purchased two LNG tankers which were previously leased. A $17 million charge was recorded on the termination of the operating leases. These tankers are used
to transport LNG from Kenai, Alaska to Tokyo, Japan.

28. Contingencies and Commitments

Marathon
is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the
environment. Certain of these matters are discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Marathon's consolidated financial
statements. However, management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

Environmental matters

–  Marathon is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous
waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $110 million and $117 million. It is
not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties that may be imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain states,
under programs to assist companies in cleanup efforts related to underground storage tanks at retail marketing outlets, were $65 million and $86 million at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

F-36

On
May 11, 2001, MAP entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which commits it to complete certain agreed on environmental projects over an
eight-year period primarily aimed at reducing air emissions at its seven refineries. The court approved this consent decree on August 28, 2001. The total one-time
expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately $370 million over the eight-year period, with about $240 million incurred through December 31, 2004. In
addition, MAP has nearly completed certain agreed on supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged Clean Air Act violations, at a cost of
$9 million. MAP believes that this settlement will provide MAP with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions.

(a)

Marathon
holds interests in an offshore oil port, LOOP LLC ("LOOP"), and a crude oil pipeline system, LOCAP LLC ("LOCAP"). Both LOOP and LOCAP have secured various
project financings with throughput and deficiency ("T&D") agreements. A T&D agreement creates a potential obligation to advance funds in the event of a cash shortfall. When these rights are assigned
to a lender to secure financing, the T&D is considered to be an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. Under the agreements, Marathon is required to advance funds if the investees are unable to service
debt. Any such advances are considered prepayments of future transportation charges. The terms of the agreements vary but tend to follow the terms of the underlying debt. Assuming
non-payment by the investees, the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is estimated to be $183 million and $192 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in these amounts are a LOOP revolving credit facility of $25 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and a LOCAP revolving credit facility of
$23 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The undrawn portion of the revolving credit facilities is $34 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

(b)

MAP
holds an interest in a refined products pipeline, Centennial Pipeline LLC ("Centennial"), and has guaranteed the repayment of Centennial's outstanding balance under
a Master Shelf Agreement, which expires in 2024, and a Credit Agreement, which expires in 2007. The guarantees arose in order to obtain adequate financing. Prior to expiration of the Master Shelf
Agreement, MAP could be relinquished from responsibility under the guarantee should Centennial meet certain financial tests. If Centennial defaults on its outstanding balance, the estimated maximum
potential amount of future payments is $75 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

(c)

In
2003, Marathon sold its interest in the Yates field and gathering system to Kinder Morgan. In accordance with this transaction, Marathon indemnified Kinder Morgan
from inaccuracies in Marathon's representations, warranties, covenants and agreement. There is not a specified term on these guarantees and the maximum potential amount of future cash payments is
estimated at $228 million.

(d)

In
conjunction with the sale of certain Canadian assets to Husky Oil operations Limited ("Husky") during 2003, Marathon guaranteed Husky with regards to unknown
environmental obligations and inaccuracies in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements by Marathon. These indemnifications are part of the normal course of doing business and selling
assets. Per the Purchase and Sale agreement, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees is $568 million.

(e)

Marathon
entered into certain performance and general guarantees and environmental and general indemnifications in connection with certain asset sales. The terms vary
from 2005 to indefinite and the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees and indemnifications is estimated to be $30 million.

(f)

Marathon
has guaranteed United States Steel's contingent obligation to repay certain distributions from its 50 percent-owned joint venture, PRO-TEC
Coating Company ("PRO-TEC"). Should PRO-TEC default under its agreements and should United States Steel be unable to perform under its guarantee, Marathon is required to
perform on behalf of United States Steel. The maximum potential payout is estimated at $14 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Additionally, United States Steel is the sole general
partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P., which owns certain cokemaking facilities formerly owned by United States Steel. Marathon has guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of United
States Steel under the partnership documents. In addition to the commitment to fund operating cash shortfalls of the partnership discussed in Note 3, United States Steel, under

F-37

certain
circumstances, is required to indemnify the limited partners if the partnership product sales fail to qualify for the credit under Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. United States
Steel has estimated the maximum potential amount of this indemnity obligation at December 31, 2004 and 2003, including interest and tax gross-up, was approximately
$620 million and $610 million. Furthermore, United States Steel under certain circumstances has indemnified the partnership for environmental obligations. The maximum potential amount of
this indemnity obligation is not estimable.

(g)

The
agreement between Centennial and its members allows each member to contribute cash in lieu of Centennial procuring separate insurance in the event of third-party
liability arising from a catastrophic event. There is an indefinite term for the agreement and each member is to contribute cash in proportion to its ownership interest, up to a maximum amount of
$50 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. In February 2003, Marathon's ownership interest in Centennial increased from 33 percent to 50 percent. As a result of this
modification to the Centennial catastrophic event guarantee, MAP recorded a $4 million obligation during 2003.

(h)

Marathon
is a party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline L.P. ("Alliance"). The agreement requires Marathon to pay minimum
annual charges of approximately $5 million through 2015. The payments are required even if the transportation facility is not utilized. As this contract has been used by Alliance to secure its
financing, the arrangement qualifies as an indirect guarantee of indebtedness. This agreement runs through 2015 and has a maximum potential payout of $67 million at December 31, 2004 and
2003. As a result of the Canadian sale discussed above, Husky has indemnified Marathon for any claims related to these guarantees.

(i)

Kenai
Kachemak Pipeline LLC ("KKPL") was organized in late 2002. Marathon is an equity investor in KKPL, holding a 60 percent, noncontrolling
interest. In April 2003, Marathon guaranteed KKPL's performance to properly construct, operate, maintain and abandon the pipeline in accordance with the Alaska Pipeline Act and
the Right of Way Lease Agreement with the State of Alaska. The major obligations covered under the guarantee include maintaining the right-of-way, satisfying any liabilities
caused by operation of the pipeline, and providing for the abandonment costs. Obligations that could arise under the guarantee would vary according to the circumstances triggering payment but the
maximum potential payment is estimated at $15 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

(j)

Marathon
has entered into leases of corporate assets containing general lessee indemnities and guaranteed residual value clauses. There is not a specified term and the
maximum potential amount of future payments is estimated to be $14 million.

(k)

These
leases contain terminal rental adjustment clauses which provide that MAP will indemnify the lessor to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the asset at
the end of the lease fall short of the specified minimum percentage of original value.

(l)

$318 million
represents guarantees made by MAP and $34 million represents the undrawn portion of revolving credit facilities.

Contract commitments

–  At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Marathon's
contract commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled $1,094 million and $565 million, respectively. The $529 million increase is primarily due to contractual
commitments related to the Equatorial Guinea LNG project. Included in these contract commitments is $65 million related to the approximately $300 million in refinery upgrade and
expansion projects for MAP's 74,000 bpd Detroit, Michigan refinery. Marathon will loan MAP the funds necessary for the Detroit, Michigan refinery upgrade and expansion projects. The MAP LLC Agreement
has been amended to allow the Detroit refinery cash flows to be dedicated to
service this debt. The Put/Call Agreement was amended to provide that, in the event Marathon exercises its call right, the Detroit refinery will not be valued at an amount less than the working
capital related to the Detroit refinery, excluding working capital additions related to the expansion and clean fuels projects.

Agreements with joint owners

–  In connection with the 1998 formation of MAP, Marathon and
Ashland entered into a Put/Call, Registration Rights and Standstill Agreement (the Put/Call Agreement). The Put/Call Agreement provides that at any time after December 31, 2004, Ashland will
have the right to sell to Marathon all of Ashland's ownership interest in MAP, for an amount in cash and/or Marathon debt or equity securities equal to the product of 85 percent
(90 percent if equity securities are used) of the fair market value of MAP at that time, multiplied by Ashland's percentage interest in MAP. Payment could be made at closing, or at Marathon's
option, in three equal annual installments, the first of which would be payable at closing. At any time after December 31, 2004, Marathon will have the right to purchase all of Ashland's
ownership interests in MAP, for an amount in cash equal to the product of 115 percent of the fair market value of MAP at that time, multiplied by Ashland's percentage interest in MAP. Pursuant
to the terms of Marathon's agreement to acquire the 38 percent ownership interest in MAP currently held by Ashland, Ashland does not have the right to exercise its put right and Marathon does
not have the right to exercise its call right under the Put/Call Agreement unless and until the acquisition agreement is terminated.

As
part of the formation of PTC, MAP and Pilot Corporation (Pilot) entered into a Put/Call and Registration Rights Agreement (Agreement). The Agreement provides that any time after
September 1, 2008, Pilot will have the right to sell its interest in PTC to MAP for an amount of cash and/or Marathon, MAP or Ashland equity securities equal to the product of 90 percent
(95 percent if paid in securities) of the fair market value of PTC at the time multiplied by Pilot's percentage interest in PTC. At any time after September 1, 2011, under certain
conditions, MAP will have the right to purchase Pilot's interest in PTC for an amount of cash and/or Marathon, MAP or Ashland equity securities equal to the product of 105 percent
(110 percent if paid in securities) of the fair market value of PTC at the time multiplied by Pilot's percentage interest in PTC.

In
connection with the formation of EGHoldings, GEPetrol was given certain contractual rights with respect to the purchase and resale to a third party of a 13 percent interest in
EGHoldings currently held by Marathon. These rights give GEPetrol the option to purchase this 13 percent interest and resell it to a third party. These rights specify that Marathon will be
reimbursed for its historical costs plus an additional specified rate of return, which escalates depending on the time period during which such purchase and resale occurs, and a right to share in
additional proceeds above those amounts under certain circumstances of resale. If GEPetrol's rights are not exercised within one year from date of project sanction, the rights expire.

F-38

29. Proposed Acquisition

Marathon
has entered into an agreement which would result in the acquisition of the 38 percent ownership interest in MAP currently held by Ashland. In addition, Marathon would acquire a portion
of Ashland's Valvoline Instant Oil Change business and its maleic anhydride business. As a result of the transaction, MAP will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon.

As
part of the transaction, Ashland will receive approximately $800 million in cash and accounts receivable from MAP to redeem a portion of its interest in MAP. Marathon will
assume approximately $1.9 billion of debt, which is expected to be repaid immediately following closing. Additionally, Ashland shareholders will receive $315 million in Marathon common
stock. Ashland's liabilities under certain existing environmental indemnification obligations related to MAP will be capped at $50 million.

The
MAP Limited Liability Company Agreement has been amended to eliminate the requirement for MAP to make quarterly cash distributions to Marathon and Ashland between the date the
principal transaction agreements were signed and the closing of the transaction. As a result, the redemption proceeds to Ashland (cash and accounts receivable) will be increased by an amount equal to
approximately 38 percent of the cash accumulated from MAP's operations during that period, subject to certain adjustments. At December 31, 2004, Ashland's share of distributable cash was
$574 million. In the event of a termination of the acquisition agreement, MAP's obligation to make cash distributions to Marathon and Ashland would be restored.

On
June 1, 2004, the United States Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the pre-closing waiting period mandated by the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act, thereby indicating that it had no present intent to challenge the acquisition and permitting the parties to proceed toward closing. Additionally, Marathon and Ashland submitted a request for a
letter ruling to the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") on the tax-free status of the proposed acquisition. Related to the proposed acquisition, Marathon filed a registration
statement on Form S-4 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 12, 2004, subsequent to Ashland filing a preliminary proxy statement on
Schedule 14A on June 21, 2004, and Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 14A on August 31, 2004. The completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions,
including favorable private letter rulings from the IRS, Ashland shareholder approval and Ashland public debt holder consents.

Of the total capitalized costs for exploratory wells, approximately $78 million and $9 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002
related to wells for which costs had been suspended for more than one year following the completion of drilling and for which additional exploratory wells are not underway or firmly planned. There

these wells, sufficient progress is being made assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of these projects to justify continued capitalization of the costs. The following table

(a)

A
plan of development for the Corrib Field was submitted to the Petroleum Affairs Division of the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources in
November 2000. Awards of major contracts for a terminal, subsea facilities, and an onshore pipeline were made between March and August 2001. Design of the facilities was commenced and
material was procured. Planning approval for the terminal
construction was received from the Mayo County Council (the "local authority") in August 2001 but this approval was appealed to the National Planning Appeals Board ("ABP") in
September 2001. As a result of the expected delay, due to the appeal to ABP, a revised plan of development was submitted in November 2001 and a Petroleum Lease was awarded to the Corrib
joint venture participants in the same month. In 2001, Marathon recognized proved undeveloped reserves due to Marathon's record of obtaining necessary permits and approvals in Ireland. In
May 2002, ABP approved the revised plan of development. In April 2003, following a lengthy appeals process, ABP refused planning permission for the terminal due to concerns over the long
term stability of stripped peat that was to be stored on the site. Marathon reclassified approximately 14 million barrels of oil equivalent from proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves
in 2003 due to continuing delays in receiving the necessary approval for the terminal. In December 2003, a new planning application was submitted to the local authority for the terminal which
addressed ABP's concerns over peat stability. The local authority granted planning permission for the revised application in April 2004; however this was subsequently appealed to ABP. In
October 2004, ABP upheld the local authority's decision to grant planning permission for the natural gas terminal. This decision is a major step forward in the Corrib Project and has allowed
development activities to proceed. Marathon recognized proved reserves for Corrib at the end of 2004.

(b)

In
2001 a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona prospect. In 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled. One was successful while the other was written off to
exploratory dry well expense in the amount of $14 million. An integrated project team was formed in 2003 to formulate a development plan. Marathon is currently negotiating commercial terms of a
production handling agreement with a nearby operator and is also in the process of reviewing seismic data to obtain a better understanding of the complex salt formations in the area and to optimize
the location of the next well. As of December 31, 2004, drilling operations for the next well were firmly planned and are expected to be completed in July 2005. The results of this well
will determine when proved reserves will be recognized.

(c)

Future
plans are to re-enter and sidetrack this well. All costs below 16,000 feet, which totaled $18 million, were written off to exploratory dry well
expense in 2001 and 2002. Marathon entered into a joint venture agreement on August 5, 2003, for a technical evaluation of the prospect. In addition, Marathon is in the process of reviewing
seismic data for another drilling prospect. As of December 31, 2004, a well was firmly planned for 2005. If a discovery is made, plans are to utilize the initial wellbore to sidetrack as an
appraisal well. The earliest that proved reserves could potentially be recognized would be at project sanction, estimated in 2007. If the 2005 well is not successful, the initial well will be written
off in 2005.

31. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

During
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123R") as a revision of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." This statement requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award, usually the vesting period. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. In 2003, Marathon adopted the fair value method for grants made, modified or settled on or
after January 1, 2003. Accordingly, management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a material affect on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. This
statement is effective for Marathon on July 1, 2005. Marathon has not yet determined whether to adopt this standard earlier than the effective date.

Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Estimates of the proved reserves have been prepared by internal asset teams including reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. Reserve
estimates are periodically reviewed by Marathon's Corporate Reserves group to assure that rigorous professional standards and the reserves definitions prescribed by the U. S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) are consistently applied throughout the company.

Proved
reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are subject to changes, either positively or negatively, as additional information becomes available and
contractual, economic and political conditions change.

Marathon's
net proved reserve estimates have been adjusted as necessary to consider all contractual agreements, royalty obligations and interests owned by others at the time of the
estimate. Only reserves that are estimated to be recovered during the term of the current contract, unless there is a clear and consistent history of contract extension, have been included in the
proved reserve estimate. Reserves from properties governed by production sharing contracts have been calculated using the "economic interest" method prescribed by the SEC. Reserves that are not
currently considered proved, that may result from extensions of currently proved areas, or that may result from applying secondary or tertiary recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be
economic are excluded. Purchased natural gas utilized in reservoir management and subsequently resold is also excluded. Marathon does not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves subject to
long-term supply agreements with foreign governments or authorities in which Marathon acts as producer.

Proved
developed reserves are the quantities of oil and gas expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. In some cases, proved
undeveloped reserves may require substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities. Production volumes shown are sales volumes, net of any products consumed during production
activities.

of estimated reserves from properties governed by production sharing contracts.

(b)

The
net positive or negative balance of proved reserves acquired or relinquished in property trades within the same geographic area is reported as purchases of reserves
in place or sales of reserves in place, respectively.

(c)

Reserves
represent the transfer of certain mineral interests on the dissolution of MKM Partners, L.P.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Future cash inflows

are computed by applying year-end prices of oil and gas relating to
Marathon's proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at
year-end.

The
assumptions used to compute the proved reserve valuation do not necessarily reflect Marathon's expectations of actual revenues to be derived from those reserves or their present
worth. Assigning monetary values to the estimated quantities of reserves, described on the preceding page, does not reduce the subjective and ever-changing nature of such reserve
estimates.

Additional
subjectivity occurs when determining present values because the rate of producing the reserves must be estimated. In addition to uncertainties inherent in predicting the
future, variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of Marathon's control, such as unintentional delays in development, environmental
concerns, changes in prices or regulatory controls.

The
reserve valuation assumes that all reserves will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place or subjected to participation by foreign governments, additional
economic considerations also could affect the amount of cash eventually realized.

Future development and production, transportation and administrative costs

are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in
developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.

Future income tax expenses

are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future
tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to Marathon's proved oil and gas reserves. Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are
recognized.

Discount

was derived by using a discount rate of 10 percent annually.

Non-Officer Restricted Stock Plan –

The Non-Officer
Restricted Stock Plan was approved by the Board effective January 1, 2001, to provide restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to non-officer employees of Marathon and its
affiliates. The purposes of the plan are to reward specific noteworthy achievements by non-officer employees and promote the retention of outstanding non-officer employees. All
awards under this plan are subject to a four-year time-based vesting schedule, with 50 percent of the shares vesting two years from the date of grant and the remaining
50 percent of the shares vesting four years from the date of grant. If a recipient terminates employment other than by reason of death, any unvested portion of his or her award will be
forfeited. Dividends are paid on all awards made under the plan prior to vesting. Marathon's authority to make grants under this plan was terminated effective as of April 30, 2003.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors –

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, all non-employee directors of Marathon are required to defer half of their annual retainers in the form of common stock units. On the date the retainer
would otherwise be payable to the non-employee director, Marathon credits an unfunded bookkeeping account for each non-employee director with a number of common stock units
equal to half of his or her annual retainer divided by the fair market value of Marathon's common stock. The ongoing value of each common stock unit equals the market price of Marathon's common stock.
When dividends are paid, Marathon credits each unfunded account with dividend equivalents on the number of units then in the individual's account in the form of additional common stock units. When the
non-employee director leaves the Board, he or she is issued actual shares of common stock equal to the number of common stock units in his or her account at that time. Marathon's authority
to make equity grants under this plan was terminated effective as of April 30, 2003.

(a)

Deductions
for the allowance for doubtful accounts and long-term receivables include amounts written off as uncollectible, net of recoveries. Deductions in
the inventory market valuation reserve reflect increases in market prices and inventory turnover, resulting in noncash credits to costs and expenses. Deductions in the state tax valuation allowance is
due to expiring net operating losses. Deductions in the foreign tax valuation allowance for 2003 relate to the sale of the exploration and production operations in western Canada and reduction in
Norway's valuation allowance due to additional deferred tax liabilities. Deductions in the federal valuation allowance reflect the amount of excess capital losses utilized during the year.

(b)

Reflects
valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets generated in the current period, primarily related to net operating losses.

(c)

Reflects
valuation allowance established for deferred tax assets generated in 2003, resulting from excess capital losses related to the sale of exploration and
production operations in western Canada.

(d)

In
preparation of the December 31, 2004 consolidated financial statements, Marathon identified certain deferred tax liabilities related to Marathon's Norway
operations that were omitted from the above disclosures related to December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. This omission resulted in an understatement of the deferred tax liability primarily related
to property, plant and equipment by $153 million, $47 million and $26 million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and a corresponding overstatement of the related valuation
allowance by the same dollar amount. Accordingly, Marathon has revised the December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 presentation to increase the deferred tax liability by $153 million,
$47 million and $26 million and correspondingly to decrease the valuation allowance by the same amount. The revision has no impact on Marathon's previously reported financial position,
tax provision, net income or cash flow.
