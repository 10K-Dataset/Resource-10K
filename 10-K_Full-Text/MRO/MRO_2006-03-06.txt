PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX
HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX
Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July
2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the
consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged
into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its
name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction
described in the next paragraph (the “Separation”),
USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

Before December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding
classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which
was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business,
and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel
Stock”), which was intended to reflect the performance of
our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of
our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common
stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel
Corporation (“United States Steel”) to holders of
Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel
Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In connection with the Separation, our certificate of
incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001 and, from
that date, Marathon has only one class of common stock
authorized.

On June 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership
interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”)
previously held by Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”). In
addition, we acquired a portion of Ashland’s Valvoline
Instant Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its
interest in LOOP LLC, which owns and operates the only
U.S. deepwater oil port, and its interest in LOCAP LLC,
which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions
(the “Acquisition”), MAP is now wholly owned by
Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company
LLC (“MPC”) effective September 1, 2005.

Segment and Geographic Information

Our operations consist of three operating segments:
1) Exploration and Production
(“E&P”) – explores for and produces
crude oil and natural gas on a worldwide basis;
2) Refining, Marketing and Transportation
(“RM&T”) – refines, markets and
transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the
Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States;
and 3) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets
and transports natural gas and products manufactured from
natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and
methanol on a worldwide basis. For operating segment and
geographic financial information, see Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Exploration and Production

(In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and
production operations, references to “net” wells,
production or sales indicate our ownership interest or share, as
the context requires.)



As of December 31, 2005 we were conducting exploration,
development and production activities in nine countries.
Principal exploration activities were in the United States,
Norway, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, the United Kingdom and
Canada. Principal development and production activities were in
the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Russia.

On December 29, 2005, in conjunction with our partners in
the former Oasis Group, we entered into an agreement with the
National Oil Corporation of Libya on the terms under which the
companies would return to their oil and natural gas exploration
and production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. See
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged
191,000 barrels per day (“bpd”), an increase
of 12 percent from 2004 levels. Our 2005 worldwide net
natural gas sales, including gas acquired for injection and
subsequent resale, averaged 932 million cubic feet per
day (“mmcfd”), a decrease of 7 percent
compared to 2004. In total, our 2005 worldwide net sales
averaged 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent
(“boe”) per day, compared to 337,000 boe per day in
2004. (For purposes of determining boe, natural gas volumes are
converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing
the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet
(“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added
to the barrel equivalent of gas volume to obtain boe.) In 2006,
our worldwide net production available for sale is expected to
average approximately 365,000 to 395,000 boe per day, including
40,000 to 45,000 bpd from our Libya operations, excluding
future acquisitions and dispositions.

The above projections of 2006 Libya and worldwide net liquid
hydrocarbon and natural gas sales and production volumes are
forward-looking statements. Some factors that could potentially
affect timing and levels of production available for sale
include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the
amount of capital available for exploration and development,
regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature
fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling
rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary
government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen
hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist
acts and the government or military response thereto, and other
geological, operating and economic considerations. These factors
(among others) could cause actual results to differ materially
from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Exploration

In the United States during 2005, we drilled 33 gross
(21 net) exploratory wells of which 29 gross
(18 net) wells encountered hydrocarbons. Of these
29 wells, one gross (zero net) well was temporarily
suspended. Internationally, we drilled 13 gross (six net)
exploratory wells of which 11 gross (five net) wells
encountered hydrocarbons. Of these 11 gross (five net)
wells, all were temporarily suspended or are in the process of
completing.

United States

– The Gulf of Mexico continues to
be a core area for us with the potential to add new reserves. At
the end of 2005, we had interests in 129 blocks in the Gulf of
Mexico, including 96 in the deepwater area.

In 2001, a successful discovery well was drilled on the Ozona
prospect (Garden Banks block 515) in the Gulf of Mexico
and, in 2002, two sidetrack wells were drilled, one of which was
successful. Our plans are to develop this as a subsea tieback to
area infrastructure. Commercial terms have been secured for the
tieback and processing of Ozona production and we are attempting
to secure a drilling rig to drill the development well. We hold
a 68 percent operated interest in the Ozona prospect.

A well on the Flathead prospect (Walker Ridge block 30) in
the Gulf of Mexico was suspended in 2002. Technical evaluations
continued during 2005 and are progressing towards a possible
re-entry and sidetrack before 2008. In 2005, a well drilled on a
block directly offsetting the Flathead prospect encountered
hydrocarbons. We hold a 100 percent operated interest in
the Flathead prospect.

In 2005, we drilled a well on the Stones prospect located on
Walker Ridge block 508 in the Gulf of Mexico to total depth
and encountered hydrocarbons. Additional drilling is required to
determine the commerciality of this prospect. We hold a
20 percent outside-operated interest in the Stones prospect.

Other United States exploration activity during 2005 included
three gross (three net) wells in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska,
all of which were discoveries, and 14 gross (six net) wells
in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, 13 gross (six net) of
which were discoveries.

Norway

– We hold interests in over
1 million gross acres offshore Norway and plan to continue
our exploration effort there. In late 2005, we began drilling an
appraisal well at the outside-operated Gudrun discovery, which
we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2006 and
followed by an evaluation of the well results.

Results for the Volund well (formerly Hamsun) are being analyzed
and development scenarios are being examined including a
possible tie-back to the Alvheim development. We own a
65 percent interest in Volund and serve as operator.



Angola

– Offshore Angola, we own a
10 percent interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent
interest in Block 32. To date we have announced 13
discoveries on these blocks, which reinforces the potential of
this trend. On Block 31, we have four previously announced
discoveries which form a potential development area in the
northeastern portion of the block (Plutao, Saturo, Marte and
Venus). In 2005, we announced five additional discoveries
located in the southeastern part of Block 31 (Palas, Ceres,
Juno, Astraea and Hebe). On Block 32, we previously
announced the Gindungo and Canela discoveries. In 2005, we
announced the Gengibre discovery and also had a successful
appraisal well on this discovery. Lastly, in early 2006, we
announced another discovery on the Mostarda prospect. Continued
exploration success reinforces the potential for a commercial
development on Block 32.

Equatorial Guinea

– During 2004, we
participated in two natural gas and condensate discoveries on
the Alba Block offshore Equatorial Guinea. The Deep Luba
discovery well, drilled from the Alba field production platform,
encountered natural gas and condensate in several pay zones. The
Gardenia discovery well is located approximately 11 miles
southwest of the Alba Field. We are currently evaluating
development scenarios for both the Deep Luba and Gardenia
discoveries. These discoveries reinforce the potential of the
Alba Block, in which we own a 63 percent interest.

In 2003, we announced a natural gas discovery on Block D
offshore Equatorial Guinea, where we are the operator with a
90 percent interest. The discovery well is on the Bococo
prospect, which is approximately six miles west of the Alba
field. The well has been suspended for re-entry at a later date.
Development scenarios for the Bococo gas discovery along with
three earlier dry gas discoveries on Block D are being
considered for further development.

Canada

– We are the operator and own a
30 percent interest in the Annapolis lease offshore Nova
Scotia. In addition, we operate the adjacent Cortland lease
where we own a 75 interest and the adjacent Empire lease where
we own a 50 percent interest.

Production (including development activities)

United States

– Approximately 40 percent
of our 2005 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales and
62 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales were
produced from U.S. operations.

During 2005, our production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged
33,800 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons, representing
44 percent of our total U.S. net liquid hydrocarbon
sales, and 84 mmcfd of natural gas, representing 14 percent
of our total U.S. net natural gas sales. Net liquid
hydrocarbon production in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by
1,900 bpd and net natural gas production decreased by 16
mmcfd from the prior year. The decrease in production is mainly
due to natural field declines and the effects of five tropical
storms or hurricanes during 2005. In September 2004, our
Petronius platform suffered damage from Hurricane Ivan and was
out of service until March 2005. At year-end 2005, we held
interests in eight producing fields and seven platforms in the
Gulf of Mexico, of which four platforms are operated by Marathon.

We are one of the largest natural gas producers in the Cook
Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. In 2005 our
Alaskan net natural gas sales averaged 167 mmcfd,
representing 29 percent of our total U.S. net natural
gas sales. Our natural gas production from Alaska is seasonal in
nature, trending down during the second and third quarters and
increasing during the fourth and first quarters to meet local
market winter demands. In addition to our operations in other
established Alaskan fields, production from the Ninilchik field
began in 2003 and development continues on the field. Ninilchik
natural gas is transported through the

32-mile

portion of the
Kenai Kachemak Pipeline which connects Ninilchik to the existing
natural gas pipeline infrastructure serving residential, utility
and industrial markets on the Kenai Peninsula, in Anchorage and
in other parts of south central Alaska. We operate Ninilchik and
own a 60 percent interest in it and the section of the
Kenai Kachemak Pipeline described above. Our 2005 development
program in the Cook Inlet included participation in the drilling
of six wells.

Net liquid hydrocarbon sales from our Wyoming fields averaged
20,700 bpd in 2005 compared to 21,200 bpd in 2004. Net
natural gas sales from our Wyoming fields averaged
104 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 108 mmcfd in 2004. The
decrease in our Wyoming net natural gas sales is primarily
attributed to lower production from the Powder River Basin,
which averaged 66 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 69 mmcfd
in 2004 primarily as a result of natural field decline,
partially offset by development drilling. Development of the
Powder River Basin continued in 2005 with approximately
195 wells drilled, compared to approximately 230 wells
drilled in 2004. Water discharge regulations impacted the pace
of development in the Powder River Basin in 2005. Additional
development of our southwest Wyoming interests continued in 2005
where we participated in the drilling of 35 wells.

Net natural gas sales from our Oklahoma fields averaged
77 mmcfd in 2005 compared to 82 mmcfd in 2004
primarily as a result of natural field decline, partially offset
by development and exploratory drilling. Our 2005 development
program continued to focus in the Anadarko Basin where we
participated in the drilling of 82 wells.



Our share of liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Permian Basin
region, which extends from southeast New Mexico to west Texas,
averaged 15,900 bpd in 2005, compared to 18,900 bpd in
2004. Net natural gas sales from our New Mexico fields,
primarily the Indian Basin field, averaged 59 mmcfd in 2005
compared to 85 mmcfd in 2004. These decreases in net sales
are due to natural field declines.

Net natural gas sales from our Texas fields, primarily located
in East Texas, averaged 73 mmcfd in 2005 compared to
65 mmcfd in 2004. This increase is primarily attributable
to drilling in the Pearwood and Giddings fields. In addition,
active development of the Mimms Creek field in East Texas
continued in 2005.

During 2005, we announced the sanctioning of the Neptune
deepwater development on Atwater Valley Blocks 573, 574,
575, 617 and 618 in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2004, we announced
that the Neptune 7 appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons.
This discovery followed the Neptune 3 discovery in 2002 and
the Neptune 5 discovery in 2003. Two successful appraisal
sidetrack wells were also drilled from the original
Neptune 5 location. We hold a 30 percent interest in
the Neptune unit which is located approximately 120 miles
off the coast of Louisiana. The field will be developed with
seven initial subsea wells tied back to a stand alone tension
leg platform. Fabrication of the platform commenced in late
2005. The drilling and completion of the development wells is
expected to begin during the first half of 2006. Neptune is
expected to begin production in late 2007 or early 2008 reaching
full production during 2008.

In 2003, we announced the Perseus discovery located on Viosca
Knoll Block 830 in the Gulf of Mexico approximately five
miles from the Petronius platform. Production from the initial
development well at Perseus was expected to begin in 2004 but,
due to hurricane activity in September 2004 and the resulting
damage to the Petronius platform, production was delayed. The
initial long-reach development well was drilled from the
Petronius platform reaching a total depth of 30,855 feet,
and first production commenced in April 2005. Drilling of a
second long-reach development well began in September 2005 and
is expected to reach the planned total depth of 31,598 feet
in the first quarter of 2006. First production from this second
well is anticipated in the second quarter of 2006. We own a
50 percent outside-operated interest in this block.

United Kingdom

– Our largest asset in the U.K.
North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and
have a 42 percent interest in the South, Central, North,
and West Brae fields and a 38 percent interest in the East
Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the
underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central Brae field
and West Brae/Sedgwick fields. The North Brae field, which is
produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field are
gas condensate fields. Our share of sales from the Brae area
averaged 18,300 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005,
compared with 15,900 bpd in 2004. The increase primarily
resulted from the timing of sales of liquid hydrocarbons and
improved performance from the West Brae reservoir. Our share of
Brae natural gas sales averaged 169 mmcfd, which was lower
than the 197 mmcfd in 2004 as a result of natural field
declines in the North and East Brae gas condensate fields.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline
and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing
and transportation business since 1986. Currently, there are 23
agreements with third-party fields contracted to use the Brae
system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff
revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact
on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and
extending the economic life of the complex.

The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the
outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”)
system. The Beryl group owns the remaining 50 percent. The
SAGE pipeline transports gas from the Brae and Beryl areas and
has a total wet natural gas capacity of approximately
1.1 billion cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The
SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes
natural gas from the SAGE pipeline and 0.8 bcf per day of
third-party natural gas from the Britannia field.

In the U.K. Atlantic Margin, we own an approximate
30 percent interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area
complex, consisting of a 28 percent interest in the main
Foinaven field, 47 percent of East Foinaven and
20 percent of the T35 and T25 accumulations, each of which
has a single well. Our share of sales from the Foinaven fields
averaged 16,000 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 9 mmcfd
of natural gas in 2005, compared to 21,900 bpd and
10 mmcfd in 2004, primarily as a result of the timing of
sales of liquid hydrocarbons; however, reliability issues and
natural field declines also contributed to the decrease.

Norway

– We are the operator and own a
65 percent interest in the Alvheim complex located on the
Norwegian Continental Shelf. This development is comprised of
the Kneler and Boa discoveries and the previously undeveloped
Kameleon accumulation. During 2004, we received approval from
the Norwegian authorities for our Alvheim plan of development
and operation (“PDO”), which will consist of a
floating production, storage and offloading vessel
(“FPSO”) with subsea infrastructure for five drill
centers and associated flow lines. The PDO also outlines
transportation of produced oil by shuttle tanker and
transportation of produced natural gas to the SAGE system using
a new

14-inch,

24-mile

cross border
pipeline. Marathon and its Alvheim project partners signed a
purchase and sale agreement in 2004 for the Odin multipurpose
shuttle tanker, which will be modified to an FPSO. In 2004,



the Alvheim partners reached agreement to tie-in the nearby
Vilje discovery, in which we own a 47 percent interest,
subject to the approval of the Norwegian government. In 2005,
the Norwegian government approved the Vilje PDO. Our share of
production from a combined Alvheim/Vilje development is expected
to reach more than 50,000 boe per day with first production
starting in early 2007.

During 2005, net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in
Norway from the Heimdal, Vale, Byggve and Skirne fields averaged
2,000 bpd and 34 mmcfd. We own a 24 percent
interest in the Heimdal field, a 47 percent interest in the
Vale field and a 20 percent interest in the Skirne field,
which came on stream during 2004.

Ireland

– We own a 100 percent interest in
the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale fields in
the Celtic Sea offshore Ireland. Net natural gas sales were
50 mmcfd in 2005, compared with 58 mmcfd in 2004. In
February 2006, we acquired an 86.5 percent operated
interest in the Seven Heads natural gas field. Previously, we
processed and transported natural gas and we provided field
operating services to the Seven Heads group through our existing
Kinsale Head facilities.

We own an 18.5 percent interest in the outside-operated
Corrib natural gas development project, located approximately
40 miles off Ireland’s west coast. During 2004, An
Bord Pleanála (the Planning Board) upheld the Mayo County
Council’s decision to grant planning approval for the
proposed natural gas terminal at Bellanaboy Bridge, County Mayo,
which will process natural gas from the Corrib field.
Development activities started in late 2004 but were suspended
in 2005 pending resolution of issues raised by opponents of the
project. A government-commissioned independent safety review of
the onshore pipeline associated with the proposed development
has been completed and we are awaiting publication of the
related report.

Equatorial Guinea

– We own a 63 percent
interest in the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea and a
52 percent interest in an onshore liquefied petroleum gas
processing plant held through an equity method investee. During
2005, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 39,600 bpd and
net natural gas sales averaged 92 mmcfd, compared to
18,900 bpd and 76 mmcfd in 2004. A condensate
expansion project in Equatorial Guinea was completed during 2004
and ramped up to full production in early 2005. This expansion
project increased condensate production from approximately
15,000 gross bpd to approximately 67,000 gross bpd
(38,000 bpd net to Marathon). A liquefied petroleum gas
(“LPG”) expansion project in Equatorial Guinea ramped
up to full production in the third quarter of 2005. Gross LPG
production increased from approximately 3,000 gross bpd to
19,000 gross bpd (11,000 bpd net to Marathon). Liquid
hydrocarbon production continues to increase as a result of the
expansion projects. Total production available for sale in
January 2006 was approximately 90,000 gross bpd
(51,000 bpd net to Marathon).

Approximately 130 mmcfd of dry gas remaining after the
condensate and LPG are removed is supplied to Atlantic Methanol
Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”), where it is used to
manufacture methanol. We own 45 percent of AMPCO, which is
reported in the Integrated Gas segment. Remaining dry gas is
returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba reservoir for
later production when the LNG plant construction project on
Bioko Island, discussed below under Integrated Gas, is completed.

Libya

– We hold a 16.33 percent interest
in the Waha concessions, which currently produce approximately
350,000 gross boe per day and encompass almost
13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. As a result of
our return to operations in Libya, we expect to add
approximately 40,000 to 45,000 net bpd of production
available for sale during 2006.

Gabon

– We are the operator of the Tchatamba
South, Tchatamba West and Tchatamba Marin fields offshore Gabon
with a 56 percent interest. Net sales in Gabon averaged
12,100 bpd of liquid hydrocarbons in 2005, compared with
13,600 bpd in 2004. Production from these three fields is
processed on a single facility at Tchatamba Marin, with
processed oil being transported through an offshore and onshore
pipeline to an outside-operated storage facility.

Russia

– During 2003 we acquired Khanty
Mansiysk Oil Corporation (“KMOC”). KMOC’s fields
are located in the Khanty Mansiysk region of western Siberia.
Net liquid hydrocarbon sales from these assets averaged
26,600 bpd during 2005, primarily from the East Kamennoye
and Potenay fields. Development activities continued in 2005,
with 82 wells drilled in East Kamennoye.

Other Matters

We hold an interest in an exploration and production license in
Sudan. We suspended operations in Sudan in 1985. We have had no
employees in the country and have derived no economic benefit
from those interests since that time. We have abided and will
continue to abide by all U.S. sanctions related to Sudan
and will not consider resuming any activity regarding our
interests there until such time as it is permitted under
U.S. law.

We discovered the Ash Shaer and Cherrife gas fields in Syria in
the 1980s. We submitted four plans of development to the Syrian
Petroleum Company in the 1990s, but none were approved. The
Syrian government subsequently claimed that the production
sharing contract for these fields had expired. We have been
involved in an



ongoing dispute with the Syrian Petroleum Company and government
of Syria over our interest in these fields. We are discussing a
settlement under which a new production sharing contract would
be executed to provide us the right to sell all or a significant
portion of our interest to a third party. We have and will
continue to comply with all U.S. sanctions related to Syria.

The above discussion of the E&P segment includes
forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of
completion of the Gudrun appraisal well, the possibility of
developing Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola, the timing and
levels of production from the Neptune development, the Perseus
discovery, the combined Alvheim/Vilje development and estimated
levels of production associated with our re-entry into Libya.
Some factors which could affect the timing of completion of the
Gudrun appraisal well, the possible development of
Blocks 31 and 32, the timing and production levels of the
Neptune development, the Perseus discovery, the Alvheim/Vilje
development and estimated levels of production in Libya include
pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, amount of
capital available for exploration and development, regulatory
constraints, drilling rig availability, inability or delays in
obtaining necessary government or third-party approvals or
permits, timing of commencing production from new wells,
unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or
terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and
other geological, operating and economic considerations. The
estimated levels of production in Libya and possible
developments in Blocks 31 and 32 could further be affected
by presently known data concerning size and character of
reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and
production experience. The foregoing factors (among others)
could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements.



Reserves

At December 31, 2005, our net proved liquid hydrocarbon and
natural gas reserves totaled approximately 1.295 billion
boe, of which 44 percent were located in Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”)
countries. The following table sets forth estimated quantities
of net proved oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each of
the last three years.

Estimated Quantities of Net Proved Liquid Hydrocarbon and
Natural Gas Reserves at December 31

Proved developed reserves represented 71 percent of total
proved reserves as of December 31, 2005, as compared to
62 percent as of December 31, 2004. Of the
374 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves at year-end
2005, less than 20 percent have been included as proved
reserves for more than three years while approximately
18 percent were added during 2005.

During 2005, we added net proved reserves of 282 million
boe, excluding 2 million boe of dispositions, while
producing 124 million boe. These net additions included
165 million boe as a result of our re-entry into Libya,
50 million boe of extensions, discoveries and other
additions, and total revisions of 58 million boe. Of the
total net reserve additions, 215 million boe were proved
developed and 67 million boe were proved undeveloped.
Additionally, we transferred 121 million boe from proved
undeveloped to proved developed during 2005. Costs incurred for
the periods ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 relating
to the development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas
reserves, were $955 million, $708 million and
$780 million. These amounts include our proportionate share
of equity method investees’ costs incurred as these were
costs necessary for the development of proved undeveloped
reserves. As of December 31, 2005, estimated future
development costs relating to the development of proved
undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves for the years 2006
through 2008 are projected to be $868 million,
$340 million and $175 million.



The Alba field in Equatorial Guinea had the most significant
positive revisions, totaling 47 million boe. Of this
volume, 21 million boe was added due to the progress on the
Equatorial Guinea LNG project, which will provide a market for
the Alba field’s natural gas reserves sooner and to a
greater extent under the current production sharing contract
than was expected when proved reserves were estimated at the end
of 2004. At the end of 2005, our total proved reserves
associated with the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea
totaled 505 million boe, or 39 percent of our total
proved reserves.

The above estimated quantities of net proved oil and natural gas
reserves, estimated future development costs relating to the
development of proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves
and timing of production from development projects are
forward-looking statements and are based on a number of
assumptions, including (among others) prices, presently known
physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs,
economic recoverability, technology developments, future
drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash
flow from operations, production experience and other operating
considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove
inaccurate, actual recoveries could be different than current
estimates.

For additional details of estimated quantities of net proved oil
and natural gas reserves at the end of each of the last three
years, see “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas
Producing Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves” on pages F-46 through F-47.
We filed reports with the U.S. Department of Energy
(“DOE”) for the years 2004 and 2003 disclosing the
year-end estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We will file a
similar report for 2005. The year-end estimates reported to the
DOE are the same as the estimates reported in the Supplementary
Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

Delivery
    Commitments

We have committed to deliver fixed and determinable quantities
of natural gas to customers under a variety of contractual
arrangements.

In Alaska, we have two long-term sales contracts with local
utility companies, which obligate us to supply approximately
152 bcf of natural gas over the remaining lives of these
contracts, which terminate in 2012 and 2018. During 2005, we
entered into another agreement with a local utility company
which, pending Regulatory Commission of Alaska approval, will
obligate us to supply approximately 60 bcf of natural gas
between 2009 and 2018. In addition, we own a 30 percent
interest in a Kenai, Alaska LNG plant and a proportionate share
of the long-term LNG sales obligation to two Japanese utility
companies. This obligation is estimated to total 62 bcf
through the remaining life of the contract, which terminates in
2009. These commitments are structured with variable-pricing
terms. Our production from various natural gas fields in the
Cook Inlet supply the natural gas to service these contracts.
Our proved reserves in the Cook Inlet are sufficient to meet
these contractual obligations.

In the U.K., we have two long-term sales contracts with utility
companies, which obligate us to supply approximately
190 bcf of natural gas through the remaining lives of these
contracts, which terminate in 2009. Our Brae area proved
reserves, acquired natural gas contracts and estimated
production rates are sufficient to meet these contractual
obligations. Pricing under these natural gas sales contracts is
variable. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion of these contracts.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Our RM&T operations are primarily conducted by MPC and its
subsidiaries, including its wholly-owned subsidiaries Speedway
SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”) and Marathon Pipe Line LLC.

Refining

We own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining
capacity of 974,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The table
below sets forth the location and daily throughput capacity of
each of our refineries as of December 31, 2005:

Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum
distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming,
desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries can
process a wide variety of crude oils and produce typical
refinery products, including reformulated and low sulfur
gasolines. Our refineries are integrated via pipelines and
barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation
links that connect the refineries allow the movement of
intermediate products to optimize operations and the production
of higher margin products. For example, naphtha may be moved
from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is
available. By shipping intermediate products between facilities
during partial refinery shutdowns, we are able to utilize
processing capacity that is not directly affected by the
shutdown work.

We increased our overall crude oil refining capacity during 2005
from 948,000 bpd to 974,000 bpd after completing the
expansion project at our Detroit refinery. This expansion
increased crude oil capacity at Detroit from 74,000 bpd to
100,000 bpd. The project also improves operating efficiency
and enables the Detroit refinery to meet new lower gasoline and
diesel sulfur specifications.

During 2005, we announced plans to evaluate a 180,000 bpd
expansion of our Garyville refinery. The initial phase of the
potential expansion includes front-end engineering and design
(“FEED”) work which began in December 2005 and could
lead to the start of construction in 2007. The project,
estimated to cost approximately $2.2 billion, could be
completed as early as the fourth quarter of 2009. The final
investment decision is subject to completion of the FEED work
and the receipt of applicable permits.

We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt
emulsions and industrial asphalts. We manufacture petroleum
pitch, primarily used in the graphite electrode, clay target and
refractory industries. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics,
aliphatic hydrocarbons, cumene, base lube oil, polymer grade
propylene, maleic anhydride and slack wax.

During 2005, our refineries processed 973,000 bpd of crude
oil and 205,000 bpd of other charge and blend stocks. The
following table sets forth our refinery production by product
group for each of the last three years:

Planned maintenance activities requiring temporary shutdown of
certain refinery operating units, or turnarounds, are
periodically performed at each refinery. We completed major
turnarounds at our Detroit and Catlettsburg refineries in 2005.

Marketing

In 2005, our refined product sales volumes (excluding matching
buy/sell transactions) totaled 21.1 billion gallons
(1,378,000 bpd). The wholesale distribution of petroleum
products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and
industrial consumers, primarily located in the Midwest, the
upper Great Plains and the Southeast, and sales in the spot
market, accounted for approximately 71 percent of our
refined product sales volumes in 2005, excluding sales related
to matching buy/sell transactions. Approximately 53 percent
of our gasoline sales volumes and 91 percent of our
distillate sales volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market
basis.

Approximately half of our propane is sold into the home heating
market, with the balance being purchased by industrial
consumers. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur
are domestically marketed to customers in the chemical industry.
Base lube oils, maleic anhydride, slack wax, extract and pitch
are sold throughout the United States and Canada, with pitch
products also being exported worldwide.

We market asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout
the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and the Southeast. Our
customer base includes approximately 830 asphalt-paving
contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and
townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

The following table sets forth our refined product sales by
product group for each of the last three years:

Refined Product Sales

We sell reformulated gasoline in parts of our marketing
territory, primarily Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky;
northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also sell
low-vapor-pressure gasoline in nine states.

As of December 31, 2005, we supplied petroleum products to
about 4,000 Marathon branded retail outlets located primarily in
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. Branded retail
outlets are also located in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Alabama and South Carolina.

SSA sells gasoline and diesel fuel through company-operated
retail outlets. As of December 31, 2005, SSA had 1,638
retail outlets in nine states that sold petroleum products and
convenience store merchandise and services, primarily under the
brand names “Speedway” and “SuperAmerica.”
SSA’s revenues from the sale of non-petroleum merchandise
totaled $2.5 billion in 2005, compared with
$2.3 billion in 2004. Profit levels from the sale of such
merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit
levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. SSA
also operates 60 Valvoline Instant Oil Change retail outlets
located in Michigan and northwest Ohio.

Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”), our joint venture
with Pilot Corporation (“Pilot”), is the largest
operator of travel centers in the United States with
approximately 260 locations in 37 states at
December 31, 2005. The travel centers offer diesel fuel,
gasoline and a variety of other services, including on-premises
brand-name restaurants. Pilot and Marathon each own a
50 percent interest in PTC.

Our marketing strategy is focused on SSA’s Midwest
operations, additional growth of the Marathon brand and
continued growth for PTC.



Supply and Transportation

We obtain the crude oil we process from negotiated contracts and
spot purchases or exchanges. In 2005, our net purchases of
U.S. produced crude oil for refinery input averaged
447,000 bpd, or 46 percent of crude oil processed,
including a net 12,000 bpd from our production operations.
In 2005, Canada was the source for 11 percent, or
111,000 bpd, of crude oil processed and other foreign
sources supplied 43 percent, or 415,000 bpd, of the
crude oil processed by our refineries, including approximately
221,000 bpd from the Middle East. This crude was acquired
from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies
and trading companies.

We operate a system of pipelines and terminals to provide crude
oil to our refineries and refined products to our marketing
areas. At December 31, 2005, we owned or leased
approximately 2,774 miles of crude oil trunk lines and
3,824 miles of refined product trunk lines. At
December 31, 2005 we had interests in the following
pipelines:

Our 85 light product and asphalt terminals are strategically
located throughout the Midwest, upper Great Plains and
Southeast. These facilities are supplied by a combination of
pipelines, barges, rail cars and/or trucks. Our marine
transportation operations include towboats and barges that
transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois
rivers, their tributaries and the Intercoastal Waterway. We also
lease and own rail cars of various sizes and capacities for
movement and storage of petroleum products and a large number of
tractors and tank trailers.

Effective October 15, 2006, most of the diesel fuel sold
for highway use must contain no more than 15 parts per million
of sulfur at the retail outlet. This new ultra low sulfur diesel
(“ULSD”) fuel requirement will place a premium on
ensuring that there is no contamination of the ULSD while it is
in transit to the retail outlet. We expect to be able to meet
these requirements.

The above discussion of the RM&T segment includes
forward-looking statements concerning the possible expansion of
the Garyville refinery. Some factors that could affect the
Garyville expansion project include the results of the FEED
work, necessary regulatory approvals, crude oil supply and
transportation logistics, necessary permits and continued
favorable investment climate, availability of materials and
labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other
risks customarily associated with construction projects. These
factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ
materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements.



Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction
and regasification operations, methanol operations, certain
other gas processing facilities and pipeline operations, and
marketing and transportation of natural gas. Also included in
the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the
costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated
gas projects.

Alaska LNG

We own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural
gas liquefaction plant and two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used
to transport LNG to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant
is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the
Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, the LNG has been
sold under a long-term contract with two of Japan’s largest
utility companies. This contract continues through March 2009,
with 2005 LNG deliveries totaling 65 gross bcf (22 net
bcf).

Equatorial Guinea LNG Project

In 2004, we and our partner, Compania Nacional de Petroleos de
Guinea Ecuatorial (“GEPetrol”), the National Oil
Company of Equatorial Guinea, through Equatorial Guinea LNG
Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”), began construction of
an LNG plant on Bioko Island that will initially deliver a
contracted offtake of 3.4 million metric tons per year
beginning in 2007 (approximately 460 mmcfd) under a Sales and
Purchase Agreement with a subsidiary of BG Group plc
(“BGML”). BGML will purchase the LNG plant’s
production for a period of 17 years on an FOB Bioko Island
basis with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index.
The LNG plant is ultimately expected to have the ability to
operate at higher rates and for a longer period than the current
contracted offtake rate and term. This project will allow us to
monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as
natural gas for the plant will be purchased from the Alba field
participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement.
Construction of the plant is ahead of schedule with first
shipment of LNG expected in the third quarter of 2007.

On July 25, 2005, Marathon and GEPetrol entered into
agreements under which Mitsui & Co., Ltd.
(“Mitsui”) and a subsidiary of Marubeni Corporation
(“Marubeni”) acquired 8.5 percent and
6.5 percent interests, respectively, in EGHoldings.
Following the transaction, we hold a 60 percent interest in
EGHoldings, with GEPetrol holding a 25 percent interest and
Mitsui and Marubeni holding the remaining interests.

The EGHoldings partners are also exploring the feasibility of
adding a second LNG train in an effort to create a regional gas
hub that would commercialize stranded natural gas from various
sources in the surrounding Gulf of Guinea region.

Elba Island LNG

In April 2004, we began delivering LNG cargoes as part of our
Elba Island, Georgia LNG regasification terminal capacity rights
agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we can supply up to
58 billion cubic feet of natural gas (as LNG) per year into
the terminal through 2021 with a possible extension to 2023.

In September 2004, we signed an agreement with BP Energy Company
(“BP”) under which BP will supply us with 58 bcf of
natural gas per year, as LNG, for a minimum period of five
years. The agreement allows for delivery of LNG at the Elba
Island LNG regasification terminal with pricing linked to the
Henry Hub index. This supply agreement with BP enables us to
fully utilize our capacity rights at Elba Island during the
period of this agreement, while affording us the flexibility to
access this capacity to commercialize other stranded natural gas
resources beyond the term of the BP contract. The agreement
commenced in 2005.

Methanol

We own a 45 percent interest in Atlantic Methanol
Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”), which owns a
methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock
for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas
production in the Alba field. Methanol sales totaled
1,052,000 gross metric tons (473,000 net metric tons)
in 2005. Production from the plant is used to supply customers
in Europe and the U.S.

AMPCO will undergo a scheduled maintenance shutdown during the
second quarter of 2006. During the outage, AMPCO will also seek
to remove bottlenecks in several parts of the plant.

Natural Gas Marketing and Transportation Activities

In addition to the sale of our own natural gas production, we
purchase gas from third-party producers and marketers for resale.



During 2005, we sold our 24 percent interest in Nautilus
Pipeline Company, LLC and our 24 percent interest in Manta
Ray Offshore Gathering Company, LLC, which are both Gulf of
Mexico natural gas pipeline systems. We still own a
34 percent interest in the Neptune natural gas processing
plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The plant has
the capacity to process 600 mmcfd of natural gas, which is
supplied by the Nautilus pipeline system.

Gas Technology

We invest in gas technology research, including

gas-to

-liquids
(“GTL”) technology which was successfully applied in a
GTL demonstration plant at the Port of Catoosa, Oklahoma in
2004. In addition to GTL, we are continuing to explore gas
technologies including methanol to power, gas to fuels and
compressed natural gas technologies.

The above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains
forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels
of production associated with the LNG plant and the possible
expansion thereof. Factors that could affect the LNG plant
include, unforeseen problems arising from construction,
inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and
third-party approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or
supply, environmental issues, availability or construction of
sufficient LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather
conditions. In addition to these factors, other factors that
could potentially affect the possible expansion of the current
LNG project and the development of additional LNG capacity
through additional projects include partner approvals, access to
sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial
negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient
regasification capacity. The foregoing factors (among others)
could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas
industry and, in particular, in the exploration and development
of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and
independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and
natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these
companies, as well as national oil companies, for the equipment
and labor required to develop and operate those properties and
in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of
our competitors have financial and other resources greater than
those available to us. As a consequence, we may be at a
competitive disadvantage in bidding for the rights to explore
for oil and natural gas. Acquiring the more attractive
exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids
involving front-end bonus payments or

commitments-to

-work
programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel,
including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based
on industry sources, we believe we currently rank ninth among

U.S.-based

petroleum
companies on the basis of 2005 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and
natural gas production.

We must also compete with a large number of other companies to
acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the
distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum
products. We rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on
the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of
December 31, 2005. We compete in four distinct
markets – wholesale, spot, branded and retail
distribution – for the sale of refined products. We
believe we compete with about 30 companies in the wholesale
distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers
and large commercial and industrial consumers; about
75 companies in the sale of petroleum products in the spot
market; nine refiner/marketers in the supply of branded
petroleum products to dealers and jobbers; and approximately 220
petroleum product retailers in the retail sale of petroleum
products. We compete in the convenience store industry through
SSA’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers
gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of
other merchandise and services. Some locations also have
on-premises brand-name restaurants such as
Subway

tm

.
We also compete in the travel center industry through our
50 percent ownership in PTC.

Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude
oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in
competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally,
results from production operations benefit from higher crude oil
and natural gas prices while refining and marketing margins may
be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price
differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect
operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry
are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events
and new and changing governmental regulations.

The Separation

On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon
completed the Separation, in which:

•

its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted
    into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel
    Corporation and became a separate, publicly traded
    company; and

•

USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.



As a result of the Separation, Marathon and United States Steel
are separate companies, and neither has any ownership interest
in the other. Effective January 31, 2006, Thomas J. Usher
retired as chairman of the board of directors and as a director
of United States Steel, and Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson retired
as a director of United States Steel. As a result, three
remaining members of our board of directors are also directors
of United States Steel.

In connection with the Separation and pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered
into a series of agreements governing their relationship after
the Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and
certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods
before the Separation. The following is a description of the
material terms of two of those agreements.

Financial Matters Agreement

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has
assumed and agreed to discharge all Marathon’s principal
repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the
following, including any amounts due on any default or
acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default
caused by Marathon:

The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before
the tenth anniversary of the Separation, United States Steel
will provide for Marathon’s discharge from any remaining
liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds.
United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing
or, to the extent not refinanced, paying Marathon an amount
equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and
unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium required to
immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue
bonds.

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel shall
have the right to exercise all of the existing contractual
rights under the lease obligations assumed from Marathon,
including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or
the grant or release of security interests. United States Steel
shall have no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen
the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without the
prior consent of Marathon other than extensions set forth in the
terms of the assumed lease obligations.

The financial matters agreement also requires United States
Steel to use commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon
released from its obligations under a guarantee Marathon
provided with respect to all United States Steel’s
obligations under a partnership agreement between United States
Steel, as general partner, and General Electric Credit
Corporation of Delaware and Southern Energy Clairton, LLC, as
limited partners. United States Steel may dissolve the
partnership under certain circumstances including if it is
required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the partnership
in excess of $150 million. In addition to the normal
commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has
indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax
exposures.

The financial matters agreement requires Marathon to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all necessary action or
refrain from acting so as to assure compliance with all
covenants and other obligations under the documents relating to
the assumed obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or
the acceleration of the payment obligations under the assumed
obligations. The agreement also obligates Marathon to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters
of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the
assumed obligations.

United States Steel’s obligations to Marathon under the
financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations
that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable
and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters
agreement does not contain any financial covenants, and United
States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages
on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer
assets without our consent.



Tax Sharing Agreement

Marathon and United States Steel have a tax sharing agreement
that applies to each of their consolidated tax reporting groups.
Provisions of this agreement include the following:

•

for any taxable period, or any portion of any taxable period,
    ended on or before December 31, 2001, unpaid tax sharing
    payments will be made between Marathon and United States Steel
    generally in accordance with the general tax sharing principles
    in effect before the Separation;

•

no tax sharing payments will be made with respect to taxable
    periods, or portions thereof, beginning after December 31,
    2001; and

•

provisions relating to the tax and related liabilities, if any,
    that result from the Separation ceasing to qualify as a tax-free
    transaction and limitations on post-Separation activities that
    might jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation.

Under the general tax sharing principles in effect before the
Separation:

•

the taxes payable by each of the Marathon Group and the
    U.S. Steel Group were determined as if each of them had
    filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax
    return; and

•

the U.S. Steel Group would receive the benefit, in the form
    of tax sharing payments by the parent corporation, of the tax
    attributes, consisting principally of net operating losses and
    various credits, that its business generated and the parent used
    on a consolidated basis to reduce its taxes otherwise payable.

In accordance with the tax sharing agreement, at the time of the
Separation, Marathon made a preliminary settlement with United
States Steel of approximately $440 million as the net tax
sharing payments owed to it for the year ended December 31,
2001 under the pre-Separation tax sharing principles.

The tax sharing agreement also addresses the handling of tax
audits and contests and other matters respecting taxable
periods, or portions of taxable periods, ended before
December 31, 2001.

In the tax sharing agreement, each of Marathon and United States
Steel promised the other party that it:

•

would not, before January 1, 2004, take various actions or
    enter into various transactions that might, under
    section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
    jeopardize the tax-free status of the Separation; and

•

would be responsible for, and indemnify and hold the other party
    harmless from and against, any tax and related liability, such
    as interest and penalties, that results from the Separation
    ceasing to qualify as tax-free because of its taking of any such
    action or entering into any such transaction.

The prescribed actions and transactions include:

•

the liquidation of Marathon or United States Steel; and

•

the sale by Marathon or United States Steel of its assets,
    except in the ordinary course of business.

In case a taxing authority seeks to collect a tax liability from
one party that the tax sharing agreement has allocated to the
other party, the other party has agreed in the sharing agreement
to indemnify the first party against that liability.

Even if the Separation otherwise qualified for tax-free
treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code,
the Separation may become taxable to Marathon under
section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code if capital
stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in
either Marathon or United States Steel is acquired, directly or
indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions
that include the Separation. For this purpose, a
“50 percent or greater interest” means capital
stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at
least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all
classes of capital stock. To minimize this risk, both Marathon
and United States Steel agreed in the tax sharing agreement that
they would not enter into any transactions or make any change in
their equity structures that could cause the Separation to be
treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions to
which those provisions of section 355(e) of the Internal
Revenue Code may apply. If an acquisition occurs that results in
the Separation being taxable under section 355(e) of the
Internal Revenue Code, the agreement provides that the resulting
corporate tax liability will be borne by the party involved in
that acquisition transaction.

Although the tax sharing agreement allocates tax liabilities
relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Separation, each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members
of the same consolidated tax reporting group during any portion
of a taxable period ended on or prior to the date of the
Separation, is jointly and severally liable under the Internal
Revenue Code for the federal income tax liability of the entire
consolidated tax reporting group for that year. To address the
possibility that the taxing authorities may seek to collect all
or part of a tax liability from one party where the tax sharing
agreement allocates that liability to the other party, the
agreement includes



indemnification provisions that would entitle the party from
whom the taxing authorities are seeking collection to obtain
indemnification from the other party, to the extent the
agreement allocates that liability to that other party. Marathon
can provide no assurance, however, that United States Steel will
be able to meet its indemnification obligations, if any, to
Marathon that may arise under the tax sharing agreement.

December 31, 2005

Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations

Separation.

Environmental Matters

We maintain a comprehensive environmental policy overseen by the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our Board of
Directors. Our Corporate Responsibility organization has the
responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations
maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance
with applicable laws and regulations. The Corporate
Responsibility Management Committee, which is comprised of
certain of our officers, is charged with reviewing our overall
performance with various environmental compliance programs. We
also have a Crisis Management Team, composed primarily of senior
management, which oversees the response to any major emergency
environmental incident involving Marathon or any of our
properties.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. These
environmental laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act
(“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water
Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with
respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and
disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with
respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990

(“OPA-90”)

with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many
states where we operate have similar laws dealing with the same
matters. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being
adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis,
and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be
broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more
accurately defined. In some cases, they can impose liability for
the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without
regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the
conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our
acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we
performed them. The ultimate impact of complying with existing
laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable
because certain implementing regulations for some environmental
laws have not yet been finalized or, in some instances, are
undergoing revision. These environmental laws and regulations,
particularly the 1990 Amendments to the CAA and its implementing
regulations, new water quality standards and stricter fuel
regulations, could result in increased capital, operating and
compliance costs.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs
of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies” and “Legal
Proceedings.”

Air

Of particular significance to our refining operations are
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)
regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004
for gasoline and 2006 for diesel fuel. Our combined capital
costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to
approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and
2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of
other refinery upgrade projects. Costs incurred through
December 31, 2005 were approximately $825 million,
with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2006. This is a
forward-looking statement. Some factors (among others) that
could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance
costs include completion of construction and

start-up

activities.

The EPA has finalized new and revised National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate
emissions (PM2.5) and ozone. In connection with these new
standards, the EPA will designate certain areas as
“nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such
areas does not meet the NAAQS. To address these nonattainment
areas, in January 2004, the EPA proposed a rule called the
Interstate Air Quality Rule (“IAQR”) that would
require significant reductions of
SO


and NOx emissions in numerous states. The final rule was
promulgated on May 12, 2005, and the rule was renamed the
Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”). While the EPA
expects that states will meet their CAIR obligations by
requiring emissions reductions from Electric Generating Units
(“EGUs”), states will have the final say on what
sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria. Our refinery
operations are located in affected states and some states may
choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the
CAIR requirements; however we cannot reasonably estimate the
final financial impact of the state actions to implement the
CAIR until the states have taken further action.



Water

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the
CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance
efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which
amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the
owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an
emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous
substances. Also, in case of such releases OPA-90 requires
responsible companies to pay resulting removal costs and
damages, provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal
sanctions for violations of its provisions.

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or
operating in U.S. waters be double hulled and that existing
tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or
removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out
schedule. As of December 31, 2005, all of the barges used
for river transport of our feedstocks and refined products meet
the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90.

We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous
substances could occur. Several coastal states in which we
operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with
expanded liability provisions, including provisions for cargo
owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator
responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans
for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90.

Solid Waste

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of
hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards
for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides
affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the
environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations,
the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground
storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated
substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal
operations at some of our RM&T facilities and primarily
utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities.
Ongoing RCRA-related costs are not expected to be material.

Remediation

We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the
normal course of operations, releases of petroleum products from
USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that
contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed
and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of
the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states,
which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to
remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of
the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of
the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation
costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST
reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been
satisfied. Accruals for remediation expenses and associated
reimbursements are established for sites where contamination has
been determined to exist and the amount of associated costs is
reasonably determinable.

Employees

We had 27,756 active employees as of December 31, 2005. Of
that number, 18,257 were employees of Speedway SuperAmerica LLC,
most of which were employed at retail marketing outlets.

Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton
refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and
Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and
Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on
January 31, 2009. The same union represents certain hourly
employees at our Texas City refinery under a labor agreement
that expires on March 31, 2009. The International
Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees
under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on
May 31, 2006 at our St. Paul Park refinery and
January 31, 2007 at our Detroit refinery.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Marathon is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the
course of its business. The following summarizes some, but not
all, of the risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.

A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas
prices would reduce our revenues, operating results and future
rate of growth.

Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Our revenues,
operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent
on the prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and refined
products. Historically, the markets for oil, natural gas and
refined products have been volatile and may continue to be
volatile in the future. Many of the factors influencing prices
of oil, natural gas and refined products are beyond our control.
These factors include:

The long-term effects of these and other conditions on the
prices of oil and natural gas are uncertain.

Lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil
and natural gas that we produce, which may reduce our revenues
and operating income. Significant reductions in oil and natural
gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures.

Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves depend on many
factors and assumptions, including various assumptions that are
based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the
estimates. Any material changes in those conditions or other
factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity
and value of our oil and natural gas reserves.

The proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in
this Report has been derived from engineering estimates. Those
estimates were prepared by our personnel and reviewed, on a
selected basis, by third-party petroleum engineers. The
estimates were calculated using oil and natural gas prices in
effect as of December 31, 2005, as well as other conditions
in existence as of that date. Any significant future price
changes may have a material effect on the quantity and present
value of our proved reserves. Future reserve revisions could
also result from changes in, among other things, governmental
regulation and severance and other production taxes.

Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves
estimating volumes to be recovered from underground
accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be directly
measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using
industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and
scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves
and future net cash flows based on the same available data.
Because of the subjective nature of oil and natural gas reserve
estimates, each of the following items may differ materially
from the amounts or other factors estimated:

•

the amount and timing of oil and natural gas production;

•

the revenues and costs associated with that production; and

•

the amount and timing of future development expenditures.

The discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves
included in this Report should not be considered as the market
value of the reserves attributable to our properties. As
required by generally accepted accounting principles, the
estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved
reserves are based generally on prices and costs as of the date
of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be
materially higher or lower.

In addition, the 10 percent discount factor that is
required to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues
for reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting
principles is not necessarily the most appropriate discount
factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time
and risks associated with our business and the oil and natural
gas industry in general.



If we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional
reserves, our future oil and natural gas production would
decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of
operations and impairing our financial condition.

The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties
generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the
extent we acquire additional properties containing proved
reserves, conduct successful exploration and development
activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional
behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved
reserves will decline materially as oil and natural gas is
produced.

Increases in crude oil prices and environmental regulations
may reduce our refined product margins.

The profitability of our refining, marketing and transportation
operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of
crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices
we obtain for refined products. We are a net purchaser of crude
oil. A significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from
various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and
trading companies, including suppliers from the Middle East.
These purchases are subject to political, geographic and
economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers
located in that area of the world. Our overall RM&T
profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of
supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we
do not recover in the marketplace. Refined product margins have
been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic
activity in the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate,
logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined
products.

In addition, environmental regulations, particularly the 1990
amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed, and are expected
to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly
requirements on refining and marketing operations, which may
reduce our refined product margins.

If we do not compete successfully with our competitors, our
future operating performance and profitability could materially
decline.

We compete with major integrated and independent oil and natural
gas companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases
and other properties. We compete with these companies, as well
as national oil companies, for the equipment and labor required
to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of
oil and natural gas to end-users. In addition, in implementing
our integrated gas strategy, we compete with major integrated
energy companies in bidding for and developing liquefied natural
gas projects, which are very capital intensive. Many of our
competitors have financial and other resources substantially
greater than those available to us. As a consequence, we may be
at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring additional properties
and bidding for and developing additional projects, such as LNG
plants. Many of our larger competitors in the LNG market can
complete more projects than we have the capacity to complete,
which could lead those competitors to realize economies of scale
that we are unable to realize. In addition, many of our larger
competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect
the demand for oil and natural gas, such as changes in worldwide
prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of
alternative fuels and the application of government regulations.

We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures
and operating costs as a result of environmental laws and
regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be
materially reduced.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment. We have incurred
and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and
maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these
laws and regulations. To the extent these expenditures, as with
all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our
products and services, operating results will be adversely
affected. The specific impact of these laws and regulations on
each of our competitors may vary depending on a number of
factors, including the age and location of their operating
facilities, marketing area and production processes. We may also
be required to make material expenditures or may become subject
to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection
with new, amended or more stringent requirements, stricter
interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery
of contamination. In addition, any failure by us to comply with
existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines
and other enforcement action against us.

Our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to
civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting
from contamination of the environment or personal injuries
caused by releases of hazardous substances.

Environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of
them have become more stringent. In some cases, they can impose
liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible
party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability
on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have
caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable
requirements when we performed them.



Worldwide political and economic developments could damage
our operations and materially reduce our profitability.

Local political and economic factors in international markets
could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately
50 percent of our oil and natural gas production in 2005
was derived from production outside the United States and
approximately 70 percent of our proved reserves as of
December 31, 2005 were located outside the United States.
In addition, we are increasing the focus of our development
operations on areas outside the United States.

There are many risks associated with operations in international
markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies
relating to crude oil, natural gas or refined product pricing
and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic
developments and international monetary fluctuations. These
risks include:

•

political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and
    civil disturbances;

•

the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property
    with or without compensation or may attempt to renegotiate or
    revoke existing contractual arrangements; and

•

fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and
    currency controls.

Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or
threat of future terrorist attacks could cause a downturn in the
economies of the United States and other developed countries. A
lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in
energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins
to decline and limit our future growth prospects. More
specifically, these risks could lead to increased volatility in
prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. In
addition, these risks could increase instability in the
financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for
us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverages that we
consider adequate.

Actions of the United States government through tax and other
legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could
reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and
overseas. The United States government can prevent or restrict
us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions
and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our
ability to operate in or gain access to opportunities in various
countries. Actions by both the United States and host
governments have affected operations significantly in the past
and will continue to do so in the future.

Our operations are subject to business interruptions and
casualty losses, and we do not insure against all potential
losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected
liabilities.

Our exploration and production operations are subject to
unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires,
loss of well control, spills, hurricanes and other adverse
weather, labor disputes and maritime accidents. In addition, our
refining, marketing and transportation operations are subject to
business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and
unplanned events such as explosions, fires, pipeline
interruptions, crude oil or refined product spills, inclement
weather or labor disputes. They are also subject to the
additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing,
collision and damage or loss from severe weather conditions. We
maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses
or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in amounts
that we believe to be prudent. Uninsured losses and liabilities
arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available
to us for exploration, drilling and production and could
materially reduce our profitability.

If Ashland fails to pay its taxes, we could be responsible
for satisfying various tax obligations of Ashland.

As a result of the transactions in which we acquired the
minority interest in MPC from Ashland, Marathon is severally
liable for federal income taxes (and in some cases for certain
state taxes) for tax years of Ashland still open as of the date
we completed the transactions. We have entered into a tax
matters agreement with Ashland, which provides that:

•

we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the Marathon
    group of companies, including the tax liabilities of MPC and the
    other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions
    (for periods after the completion of the transactions); and

•

Ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of
    the Ashland group of companies before the completion of the
    transactions, and the income taxes attributable to
    Ashland’s interest in MPC before the completion of the
    transactions. However, under certain circumstances we will have
    several liability for those tax liabilities owed by Ashland to
    various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue
    Service.

If Ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are
severally liable, we may be required to satisfy this tax
obligation. That would leave us in the position of having to
seek indemnification from Ashland. In that event, our



indemnification claims against Ashland would constitute general
unsecured claims, which would be effectively subordinate to the
claims of secured creditors of Ashland, and we would be subject
to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt
from Ashland.

Marathon is required to pay Ashland for deductions relating
to various contingent liabilities of Ashland, which could be
material.

We are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent
liabilities that will be paid by Ashland after completion of the
transactions. Under the tax matters agreement, we are required
to pay the benefit of those deductions to Ashland, with the
computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments
divided into two “baskets,” as described below:

Basket One

– This applies to the first
$30 million of contingent liability deductions (increased
by inflation each year up to a maximum of $60 million) that
we may claim in each year for the first 20 years following
the acquisition. The benefit of Basket One deductions is
determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by 32%
(or, if different, by a percentage equal to three percentage
points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the
applicable tax year). We are obligated to pay this amount to
Ashland. The computation and payment of Basket One amounts does
not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from
the use of the contingent liability deductions in Basket One.
Upon specified events related to Ashland (or after
20 years), the contingent liability deductions that would
otherwise have been compensated under Basket One will be taken
into account in Basket Two. In addition, Basket One applies only
for Federal income tax purposes; state, local or foreign tax
benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be
compensated only under Basket Two.

Because we are required to make payments to Ashland whether or
not we generate any actual tax savings from the Basket One
contingent liability deductions, the amount of our tax benefit
payments to Ashland with respect to Basket One contingent
liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that
we derive from these deductions. We are obligated to make these
payments to Ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable
income to realize any benefit for the deductions.

Basket Two

– All contingent liability
deductions relating to Ashland’s pre-transactions
operations that are not subject to Basket One are considered and
compensated under Basket Two. The benefit of Basket Two
deductions is determined on a “with and without”
basis; that is, the contingent liability deductions are treated
as the last deductions used by the Marathon group. Thus, if the
Marathon group has deductions, tax credits or other tax benefits
of its own, it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent
possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent
liability deductions. To the extent that we have the capacity to
use the contingent liability deductions based on this
methodology, the actual amount of tax saved by the Marathon
group through the use of the contingent liability deductions
will be calculated and paid to Ashland. Because Basket Two
amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the
Marathon group from the use of Basket Two deductions, those
amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a
change in the Marathon group’s tax liability for a
particular year. This could occur because of audit adjustments
or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years, for
example. To the extent that such a recalculation results in a
smaller Basket Two benefit with respect to a contingent
liability deduction for which Ashland has already received
compensation, Ashland is required to repay such compensation to
Marathon. In the event we become entitled to any repayment, we
would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting
an unsecured claim from Ashland.

If the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the
minority interest in MPC previously owned by Ashland were found
to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we could be
required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to
return a portion of the interest in MPC, and either of those
results could have a material adverse effect on us.

In a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more
creditors or a representative of creditors of Ashland, a court
may review our recently completed transactions with Ashland
under the fraudulent transfer provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code and comparable provisions of state
fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws. Under those laws, the
transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined
that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or that the
transactions were constructively fraudulent. If the transactions
were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, we might
be required to provide additional consideration to Ashland or to
return all or a portion of the interest in MPC and the other
assets we acquired from Ashland.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the laws of most states,
a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a
court determined that:

•

the transferor received less than “reasonably equivalent
    value” or, in some jurisdictions, less than “fair
    consideration” or “valuable
    consideration;” and



•

the transferor:

•

was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered
    insolvent by the transfer;

•

was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business or
    transaction for which its remaining property constituted
    unreasonably small capital; or

•

intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its
    ability to pay as those debts matured.

In connection with our recently completed transactions with
Ashland, we delivered part of the overall consideration
(specifically, shares of our common stock having a value of
$915 million) to Ashland’s shareholders. In order to
help establish that Ashland nevertheless received reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the
transactions, we obtained a written opinion from a nationally
recognized appraisal firm to the effect that Ashland received
amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of
Ashland’s interest in MPC and the other assets we acquired.
We also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm
relating to various financial tests that supported our
conclusion and Ashland’s representation to us that Ashland
was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the
closing of the transactions. Those opinions were based on
specific information provided to it and were subject to various
assumptions, including assumptions relating to Ashland’s
existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverages.
Although we are confident in our conclusions regarding
(1) Ashland’s receipt of reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration and (2) Ashland’s solvency, it
should be noted that the valuation of any business and a
determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous
assumptions and uncertainties, and it is possible that a court
could disagree with our conclusions.

If United States Steel fails to perform any of its material
obligations to which we have financial exposure, we could be
required to pay those obligations, and any such payment could
materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair
our financial condition.

In connection with the separation of United States Steel from
Marathon, United States Steel agreed to hold Marathon harmless
from and against various liabilities. While we cannot estimate
some of these liabilities, the portion of these liabilities that
we can estimate amounts to $597 million as of
December 31, 2005, including accrued interest of
$9 million. If United States Steel fails to satisfy any of
those obligations, we would be required to satisfy them and seek
indemnification from United States Steel. In that event, our
indemnification claims against United States Steel would
constitute general unsecured claims, effectively subordinate to
the claims of secured creditors of United States Steel.

Under applicable law and regulations, we also may be liable for
any defaults by United States Steel in the performance of its
obligations to pay federal income taxes, fund its ERISA pension
plans and pay other obligations related to periods prior to the
effective date of the separation.

United States Steel has non-investment grade credit ratings and
has granted security interests in some of its assets. The steel
business is highly competitive and a large number of industry
participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the
past. The enforceability of our claims against United States
Steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy,
fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting
creditors’ rights generally, or of general principles of
equity, which might become applicable to those claims or other
claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the
separation was effected.

If the transfer of ownership of various assets and operations
by Marathon’s former parent entity to Marathon was held to
be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer, United States
Steel’s creditors may be able to obtain recovery from us or
other relief detrimental to the holders of our common stock.

In July 2001, USX Corporation (“Old USX”) effected a
reorganization of the ownership of its businesses in which it
created Marathon as its publicly owned parent holding company
and transferred ownership of various assets and operations to
Marathon, and it merged into a newly formed subsidiary which
survived as United States Steel.

If a court in a bankruptcy case regarding United States Steel or
a lawsuit brought by its creditors or their representative were
to find that, under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or
transfer law:

•

the transfer by Old USX to Marathon or related transactions were
    undertaken by Old USX with the intent of hindering, delaying or
    defrauding its existing or future creditors; or

•

Old USX received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
    consideration, or no value or consideration, in connection with
    those transactions, and either it or United States Steel

•

was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of those
    transactions,



•

was engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for
    which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or

•

intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond
    its ability to pay as they mature,

then that court could determine those transactions entitled one
or more classes of creditors of United States Steel to equitable
relief from us. Such a determination could permit the unpaid
creditors to obtain recovery from us or could result in other
actions detrimental to the holders of our common stock. The
measure of insolvency for purposes of these considerations would
vary depending on the law of the jurisdiction being applied.

We may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the
voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.

Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to
issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more
classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences,
powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights,
including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends
and distributions, as our board of directors generally may
determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of
preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the
value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders
of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our
directors in all events or on the happening of specified events
or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the
repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we
could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the
residual value of the common stock.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

As of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments
from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 2.

Properties

The location and general character of the principal oil and gas
properties, refineries and gas plants, pipeline systems and
other important physical properties of Marathon have been
described previously. Except for oil and gas producing
properties, which generally are leased, or as otherwise stated,
such properties are held in fee. The plants and facilities have
been constructed or acquired over a period of years and vary in
age and operating efficiency. At the date of acquisition of
important properties, titles were examined and opinions of
counsel obtained, but no title examination has been made
specifically for the purpose of this document. The properties
classified as owned in fee generally have been held for many
years without any material unfavorably adjudicated claim.

The basis for estimating oil and gas reserves is set forth in
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –
Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing
Activities – Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and
Gas Reserves” on

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Marathon is the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending
or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are
included below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies
could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However,
management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and
competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

Natural Gas Royalty Litigation

Marathon was served in two qui tam cases, which allege that
federal and Indian lessees violated the False Claims Act with
respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas
and natural gas liquids. The first case, U.S. ex rel Jack
J. Grynberg v. Alaska Pipeline Co., et al is primarily
a gas measurement case and the second case, U.S. ex rel
Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al, is
primarily a gas valuation case. These cases assert that false
claims have been filed by lessees and that penalties, damages
and interest total more than $25 billion. The Department of
Justice has announced that it would intervene or has reserved
judgment on whether to intervene against specified oil and gas
companies and also announced that it would not intervene against
certain other defendants including Marathon. In the Grynberg
case, the parties have briefed and argued their motions



regarding whether the District Court should adopt the
recommendations of the Magistrate which would dismiss Marathon
and many other defendants on jurisdictional grounds. The Wright
case is in the discovery phase. Marathon intends to continue to
vigorously defend these cases.

Powder River Basin Litigation

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”)
completed multi-year reviews of potential environmental impacts
from coal bed methane development on federal lands in the Powder
River Basin, including those in Wyoming. The BLM signed a Record
of Decision (“ROD”) on April 30, 2003 supporting
increased coal bed methane development. Plaintiff environmental
and other groups filed suit in May 2003 in federal court against
the BLM to stop coal bed methane development on federal lands in
the Powder River Basin until the BLM conducted additional
environmental impact studies. Marathon intervened as a party in
the ongoing litigation before the Wyoming Federal District Court.

As these lawsuits to delay energy development in the Powder
River Basin progress through the courts, the Wyoming BLM
continues to process permits to drill under the ROD.

In May 2004, plaintiff environmental groups Environmental
Defense et al filed suit against the U.S. BLM in
Montana Federal District Court, alleging the agency did not
adequately consider air quality impacts of coal bed methane and
oil and gas operations in the Powder River Basin in Montana and
Wyoming when preparing its environmental impact statements.
Plaintiffs request that the BLM be ordered to cease issuing
leases and permits for energy development, until additional
analysis of predicted air impacts is conducted. Marathon and its
subsidiary Pennaco Energy, Inc. intervened in this litigation.

MTBE Litigation

Marathon is a defendant along with many other refining companies
in over 40 cases in 11 states alleging methyl
tertiary-butyl ether (“MTBE”) contamination in
groundwater. All of these cases have been consolidated in a
multi-district litigation in the Southern District of New York
for preliminary proceedings. The judge in this multi-district
litigation ruled on April 20, 2005 that some form of market
share liability would apply. Market share liability enables a
plaintiff to sue manufacturers who represent a substantial share
of a market for a particular product and shift the burden of
identification of who actually made the product to the
defendants, effectively forcing a defendant to show that it did
not produce the MTBE which allegedly caused the damage. The
judge further allowed cases to go forward in New York and 11
other states, based upon varying theories of collective
liability, and predicted that a new theory of market share
liability would be recognized in Connecticut, Indiana and
Kansas. The plaintiffs generally are water providers or
governmental authorities and they allege that refiners,
manufacturers and sellers of gasoline containing MTBE are liable
for manufacturing a defective product and that owners and
operators of retail gasoline sites have allowed MTBE to be
discharged into the groundwater. Several of these lawsuits
allege contamination that is outside of Marathon’s
marketing area. A few of the cases seek approval as class
actions. Many of the cases seek punitive damages or treble
damages under a variety of statutes and theories. Marathon
stopped producing MTBE at its refineries in October 2002. The
potential impact of these recent cases and future potential
similar cases is uncertain. The Company will defend these cases
vigorously.

Acquisition Litigation

On April 8, 2005, Shiva Singh instituted a class action in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County
against Ashland, and the individual members of Ashland’s
Board of Directors. The complaint also named Marathon, MPC and
Credit Suisse First Boston LLC (“CSFB”) as defendants.
The complaint stated that Mr. Singh held Ashland common
stock and that the complaint was brought on behalf of
Mr. Singh and others similarly situated. The action arose
from the transaction proposed at that time in which Ashland
would transfer its entire 38 percent interest in MPC as
well as certain other businesses to Marathon. The complaint
alleged breach of fiduciary duty as well as aiding and abetting
breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against Ashland, its
directors, Marathon and MPC. The complaint alleged breach of
fiduciary duty and negligence as well as aiding and abetting
breach of fiduciary duty and negligence against CSFB.

On September 20, 2005, the federal judge entered an order
dismissing certain of the plaintiff’s negligence claims
against CSFB and the aiding and abetting claims against all
defendants and directed the court clerk to “mark the case
closed.” This case is not currently pending.

Product Contamination Litigation

A lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia and alleges that
Marathon’s Catlettsburg refinery sold defective gasoline to
wholesalers and retailers, causing permanent damage to storage
tanks, dispensers and related equipment, resulting in lost
profits, business disruption, and



personal and real property damages. Plaintiffs seek class action
status. In 2002, MPC conducted extensive cleaning operations at
affected facilities but denies that any permanent damages
resulted from the incident. MPC previously settled with many of
the potential class members in this case and intends to
vigorously defend this action.

Environmental Proceedings

The following is a summary of proceedings involving Marathon
that were pending or contemplated as of December 31, 2005
under federal and state environmental laws. Except as described
herein, it is not possible to predict accurately the ultimate
outcome of these matters; however, management’s belief set
forth in the first paragraph under “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” above takes such matters into account.

Claims under CERCLA and related state acts have been raised with
respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other
sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the cleanup of hazardous
substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible
parties (“PRPs”) for each site include present and
former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators
of the substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be
joint and several. Because of various factors including the
difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any
particular site, the complexity of determining the relative
liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable
remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup
costs and the time period during which such costs may be
incurred, Marathon is unable to reasonably estimate its ultimate
cost of compliance with CERCLA.

Projections, provided in the following paragraphs, of spending
for and/or timing of completion of specific projects are
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the
factors provided in the preceding paragraph. To the extent that
these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future spending for,
or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ
materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements.

At December 31, 2005, Marathon had been identified as a PRP
at a total of seven CERCLA waste sites. Based on currently
available information, which is in many cases preliminary and
incomplete, Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and
remediation costs in connection with six of these sites will be
under $1 million per site, and most will be under $100,000.
Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation
costs in connection with the one remaining site will be under
$3 million.

In addition, there is one site where Marathon has received
information requests or other indications that it may be a PRP
under CERCLA but where sufficient information is not presently
available to confirm the existence of liability.

There are also 123 additional sites, excluding retail marketing
outlets, related to Marathon where remediation is being sought
under other environmental statutes, both federal and state, or
where private parties are seeking remediation through
discussions or litigation. Based on currently available
information, which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete,
Marathon believes that its liability for cleanup and remediation
costs in connection with 29 of these sites will be under
$100,000 per site, 51 sites have potential costs between
$100,000 and $1 million per site and 18 sites may involve
remediation costs between $1 million and $5 million
per site. Nine sites have incurred remediation costs of more
than $5 million per site and there are 16 sites with
insufficient information to estimate future remediation costs.

There is one site that involves a remediation program in
cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental
Quality (“MDEQ”) at a closed and dismantled refinery
site located near Muskegon, Michigan. During the next five
years, Marathon anticipates spending approximately
$5 million at this site. Appropriate site characterization
and risk-based assessments necessary for closure will be refined
during 2006 and may change the estimated future expenditures for
this site. The closure strategy being developed for this site
and ongoing work at the site are subject to approval by the
MDEQ. Expenditures in 2005 were approximately $540,000, with
expenditures in 2006 expected to be $1 million.

MPC has had a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Attorney
General’s Office since 2002 concerning its self-reporting
of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related
to storage tanks at its Robinson, Illinois refinery. MPC
anticipates more discussions with Illinois officials in 2006.

In August of 2004, the West Virginia Department of Environmental
Protection (“WVDEP”) submitted a draft consent
order to MPC regarding its handling of alleged hazardous waste
generated from tank cleanings in the State of West Virginia. The
proposed order sought a civil penalty of $337,900. MPC resolved
this matter in 2005 by entering an administrative order with
WVDEP where no civil penalty was imposed but MPC agreed to pay
$95,297 as an administrative settlement, a contribution to the
State Department of Natural Resources for park remediation
efforts unrelated to this matter and a reimbursement of
WVDEP’s costs.



SEC Investigation Relating to Equatorial Guinea

By letter dated July 15, 2004, the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) notified Marathon that
it was conducting an inquiry into payments made to the
government of Equatorial Guinea, or to officials and persons
affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial
Guinea. This inquiry followed an investigation and public
hearing conducted by the United States Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which reviewed the transactions
of various foreign governments, including that of Equatorial
Guinea, with Riggs Bank. The investigation and hearing also
reviewed the operations of U.S. oil companies, including
Marathon, in Equatorial Guinea. There was no finding in the
Subcommittee’s report that Marathon violated the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other applicable
laws or regulations. Marathon has been voluntarily producing
documents requested by the SEC in that inquiry. On
August 1, 2005, Marathon received a subpoena issued by the
SEC pursuant to a formal order of investigation requiring the
production of the documents that have already been produced or
that are in the process of being identified and produced in
response to the SEC’s prior requests, and requesting
additional materials. Marathon has been and intends to continue
cooperating with the SEC in this investigation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Marathon is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of
crude oil and natural gas; domestic refining, marketing and
transportation of crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in
the Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United
States; and worldwide marketing and transportation of natural
gas and products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and
methanol. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations should be read in
conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk
Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Certain sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations include
forward-looking statements concerning trends or events
potentially affecting our business. These statements typically
contain words such as “anticipates,”
“believes,” “estimates,”
“expects,” “targets,” “plans,”
“projects,” “could,” “may,”
“should,” “would” or similar words
indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. In accordance
with ”safe harbor” provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are
accompanied by cautionary language identifying important
factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could
cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth
in the forward-looking statements.

Unless specifically noted, amounts for MPC include the
38 percent interest held by Ashland prior to the
Acquisition on June 30, 2005, and amounts for EGHoldings
include the 25 percent interest held by GEPetrol, and the
8.5 percent interest held by Mitsui and the
6.5 percent interest held by Marubeni subsequent to
July 25, 2005.

Overview

Exploration and Production

Exploration and production segment revenues correlate closely
with prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil
and natural gas produced. The increase in our E&P segment
revenues during 2005 tracked the increase in prices for these
commodities. Higher prices for crude oil during 2005 reflected
concerns about international supply and hurricane damage in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The average spot price during 2005 for
West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”), a benchmark crude
oil, was $56.70 per barrel, up from an average of $41.47 in
2004, and ended the year at $61.04. The average differential
between WTI and Brent (an international benchmark crude oil)
narrowed to $2.18 in 2005 from $3.20 in 2004. Our domestic crude
production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content
than light sweet WTI. Heavier and higher sulfur crude oil
(commonly referred to as sour crude) sells at a discount to
light sweet crude oil. The majority of OPEC spare capacity and
new production worldwide is medium sour or heavy sour, so the
discount for medium and heavy sour crudes has increased relative
to light sweet crude and thus reduced the relative profitability
of sour crude production. Outside of Russia, our international
crude production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in
relation to the Brent crude benchmark.

Natural gas prices were also higher in 2005 compared to 2004. A
significant portion of our United States lower 48 natural gas
production is sold at bid-week prices or

first-of

-month indices
relative to our specific producing areas. Our natural gas prices
in Alaska are largely contractual, while natural gas production
there is seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and
third quarters and increasing during the fourth and first
quarters. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are
Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where large portions of our
natural gas are sold at contractual prices, making realized
prices in these areas less volatile.

For information on price risk management, see
“Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.”

E&P segment income during 2005 was up approximately
76 percent from 2004 levels, impacted by higher product
prices as discussed above and increased liquid hydrocarbon sales
volumes. We estimate that our 2006 production available for sale
will average approximately 365,000 to 395,000 boe per day,
excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions. This
includes an estimated 40,000 to 45,000 boe per day as a result
of our return to operations in the Waha concessions in Libya.
With the developments we have under construction, we estimate
our production will grow to 475,000 to 525,000 boe per day by
2008, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.

Projected production levels for liquid hydrocarbons and natural
gas are based on a number of assumptions, including (among
others) pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the
amount of capital available for exploration and development,
regulatory constraints, production decline rates of mature
fields, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling
rig availability, inability or delay in obtaining necessary
government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen
hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist
acts and the government or military response thereto, and other
geological, operating and economic



considerations. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate.
Prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been
driven by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting
from fluctuations in economic activity and political
developments in the world’s major oil and gas producing
areas, including OPEC member countries. Any substantial decline
in such prices could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations. A decline in such prices could also
adversely affect the quantity of liquid hydrocarbons and natural
gas that can be economically produced and the amount of capital
available for exploration and development.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

We refine, market and transport crude oil and petroleum
products, primarily in the Midwest, upper Great Plains and
southeastern United States. RM&T segment income depends
largely on our refining and wholesale marketing margin, refinery
throughputs, retail marketing margins for gasoline, distillates
and merchandise, and the profitability of our pipeline
transportation operations.

The refining and wholesale marketing margin is the difference
between the wholesale prices of refined products sold and the
cost of crude oil and other feedstocks refined, the cost of
purchased products and manufacturing costs. We purchase crude
oil to satisfy our refineries’ throughput requirements. As
a result, our refining and wholesale marketing margin could be
adversely affected by rising crude oil and other feedstock
prices that are not recovered in the marketplace. The crack
spread, which is generally a measure of the difference between
spot market gasoline and distillate prices and spot market crude
costs, is an industry indicator of refining margins. In addition
to changes in the crack spread, our refining and wholesale
marketing margin is impacted by the types of crude oil we
process, the wholesale selling prices we realize for all the
products we sell and our level of manufacturing costs. We
process significant amounts of sour crude oil which enhances our
competitive position in the industry as sour crude oil typically
can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. Over the last
three years, approximately 60 percent of the crude oil
throughput at our refineries has been sour crude oil. As the
largest U.S. producer of asphalt, our refining and
wholesale marketing margin is significantly impacted by the
selling price of asphalt. Sales of asphalt increase during the
highway construction season in our market area, which is
typically in the second and third quarters. The selling price of
asphalt is dependent on the cost of crude oil, the price of
alternative paving materials and the level of construction
activity in both the private and public sectors. Finally, our
refining and wholesale marketing margin is impacted by changes
in manufacturing costs from period to period, which are
primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the
refineries, and the price of purchased natural gas. Our refining
and wholesale marketing margin has been historically volatile
and varies with the level of economic activity in our various
marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities
and the expectations regarding the adequacy of the supply of
refined products and raw materials.

For information on price risk management, see
“Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk.”

Our retail marketing margin for gasoline and distillates, which
is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers
and the wholesale cost of the refined products, including
secondary transportation, also plays an important part in
RM&T profitability. Factors affecting our retail gasoline
and distillate margin include competition, seasonal demand
fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of
economic activity in our marketing areas and weather situations
that impact driving conditions. Gross margins on merchandise
sold at retail outlets tend to be less volatile than the gross
margin from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Factors
affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include
consumer demand for merchandise items, the impact of competition
and the level of economic activity in our marketing areas.

The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is
primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through the
pipelines. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly
affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in
the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key
factors in this supply and demand balance are the production
levels of crude oil by producers, the availability and cost of
alternative modes of transportation, and refinery and
transportation system maintenance levels. The throughput of the
refined products that we transport is directly affected by the
production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in
the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of
our markets, demand for gasoline peaks during the summer driving
season, which extends from May through September, and declines
during the fall and winter months. The seasonal pattern for
distillates is the reverse of this, helping to level overall
variability on an annual basis. As with crude oil, other
transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels
influence refined product movements.

Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas
resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to
declining production and growing demand. LNG, particularly in
regard to our operations in Equatorial Guinea, is a key
component of that integrated gas strategy. Our integrated gas
operations include



marketing and transportation of natural gas and products
manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol,
primarily in the United States, Europe and West Africa. Also
included in the financial results of the IG segment are the
costs associated with ongoing development of certain integrated
gas projects. The profitability of these operations depends
largely on commodity prices, volume deliveries, margins on
resale gas, and demand. Methanol spot pricing is volatile
largely because global methanol demand is only 33 million
tons and any major unplanned shutdown of or addition to
production capacity can have a significant impact on the
supply-demand balance.

2005 Operating Highlights

•

We achieved exploration success with eight discoveries from 11
    significant wells. We strengthened core E&P areas by:

•

We added net proved oil and natural gas reserves of
    282 million boe, excluding 2 million boe of
    dispositions, while producing 124 million boe during 2005.
    Over the past three years, we have added net proved reserves of
    675 million boe, excluding dispositions of approximately
    277 million boe, while producing approximately
    385 million boe.

•

We strengthened our RM&T business by:

•

acquiring full ownership of our RM&T operations, with our
    acquisition of the 38 percent interest previously held by
    Ashland;

•

completing the 26,000 bpd expansion of our Detroit
    refinery; and

•

initiating FEED work for a potential 180,000 bpd expansion
    of our Garyville, Louisiana refinery.

•

We achieved same store merchandise sales growth of
    11.7 percent at Speedway SuperAmerica in 2005, which is the
    third consecutive year of double digit merchandise sales growth,
    and same store gasoline sales volume growth of 4.0 percent,
    which is the fourth consecutive year of better than one percent
    volume growth.

•

We advanced our integrated gas strategy by:

•

accelerating the EG LNG plant construction, such that the
    project is 66 percent complete at the end of 2005 with the
    first LNG shipments projected for the third quarter of
    2007; and

•

initiating an LNG supply contract to utilize our Elba Island,
    Georgia re-gasification terminal access rights.

•

We increased the quarterly dividend 18 percent to 33 cents
    per share.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if
(1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material
due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to
account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of
such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates
and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance
is material.

Estimated Net Recoverable Quantities of Oil and Natural
Gas

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil
and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method
inherently relies on the estimation of proved oil and natural
gas reserves, both developed and undeveloped. The existence and
the estimated amount of proved reserves affect, among other
things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the
amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized
into income and the presentation of supplemental information on
oil and gas producing activities. Both the expected



future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing
properties used in testing such properties for impairment and
the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred
tax assets also rely, in part, on estimates of net recoverable
quantities of oil and natural gas.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural
gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrate with
reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. Estimates of proved reserves may change, either
positively or negatively, as additional information becomes
available and as contractual, economic and political conditions
change. During 2005, net revisions of previous estimates
increased total proved reserves by 58 million boe (five
percent of the

beginning-of

-the-year
reserves estimate). Positive revisions of 82 million boe
were partially offset by 24 million boe in negative
revisions.

Our estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and natural
gas is a highly technical process performed by in-house teams of
reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. All estimates
prepared by these teams are approved by members of our Corporate
Reserves Group. Any revisions of proved reserves estimates in
excess of 2.5 million boe on a total-field basis must be
approved by the Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to
our Chief Financial Officer. The Corporate Reserves Group audits
recent acquisitions of material fields and properties with
problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden
changes in performance or changes in economic or operating
conditions. In addition, third-party consultants are engaged to
audit reserve estimates with the stated objective of reviewing
the top 80 percent of our reserves over a three-year
period. Third-party audits did not result in any significant
changes to reserve estimates during 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The reserves of the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea
comprise approximately 39 percent of our total proved oil
and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2005. The
reserves of the Waha concession in Libya that were acquired at
the end of 2005 comprise approximately 13 percent of our
total proved oil and natural gas reserves at that date. The next
five largest oil and gas producing asset groups – the
Alvheim development offshore Norway, the Brae Area Complex
offshore the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the Kenai field
in Alaska, the Petronius development in the Gulf of Mexico and
the East Kamennoye license in Russia – comprise a
total of approximately 15 percent of our total proved oil
and natural gas reserves.

Depreciation and depletion of producing oil and natural gas
properties is determined by the

units-of

-production
method and could change with revisions to estimated proved
developed reserves. The change in the depreciation and depletion
rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous
reserve estimates has not been significant. A five percent
increase in the amount of oil and natural gas reserves would
change the depreciation and depletion rate from $6.04 per
barrel to $5.75 per barrel, which would increase pretax
income by approximately $36 million annually, based on 2005
production. A five percent decrease in the amount of oil and
natural gas reserves would change the depreciation and depletion
rate from $6.04 per barrel to $6.36 per barrel and
would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately
$40 million annually, based on 2005 production.

Fair Value Estimates

We are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate
the purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, to assess impairment of
long-lived assets and goodwill and to record non-exchange traded
derivative instruments. Other items which require estimates of
fair value include asset retirement obligations, guarantee
obligations and stock-based compensation.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid
to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities
based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. The excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are
those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable
intangible assets. We use all available information to make
these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions,
engage third-party consultants for assistance. During 2005, we
made two significant acquisitions with an aggregate purchase
price of $3.153 billion that was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements
for information on these acquisitions. As of December 31,
2005, we have recorded goodwill of $1.307 billion. Such
goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment
annually, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been
reduced below carrying value.

The fair values used to allocate the purchase prices of
acquisitions and to test goodwill for impairment are often
estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows
method, which requires us to project related future revenues and
expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates
used in determining fair values are based on assumptions
believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and
unpredictable. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the
projected results used to determine fair value.



Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment
whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For
purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be
grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can
be identified, which generally is field-by-field for E&P
assets, refinery and associated distribution system level or
pipeline system level for refining and transportation assets, or
site level for retail stores. If the sum of the undiscounted
pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset
group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair
value.

Estimating the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas
producing asset groups requires assumptions about matters such
as future oil and natural gas prices, estimated recoverable
quantities of oil and natural gas, expected field performance
and the political environment in the host country. An impairment
of any of our large oil and gas producing properties could have
a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and
results of operations.

We evaluate our unproved property investment for impairment
based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an
undiscounted future net cash flow approach. Information such as
drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation
or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. The
expected future cash flows from our RM&T assets require
assumptions about matters such as future product prices, future
crude oil and other feedstock costs, estimated remaining lives
of the assets and future expenditures necessary to maintain the
assets’ existing service potential.

We did not have significant impairment charges during 2005 or
2003. During 2004, we recorded an impairment of $32 million
related to unproved properties and $12 million related to
producing properties primarily as a result of unsuccessful
developmental drilling activity in Russia.

We record all derivative instruments at fair value. We have two
long-term contracts for the sale of natural gas in the U.K.
which are accounted for as derivative instruments. These
contracts expire in September 2009. These contracts were entered
into in the early 1990s in support of our investments in the
East Brae field and the SAGE pipeline. Contract prices are
linked to a basket of energy and other indices. The contract
price is reset annually in October based on the previous
twelve-month changes in the basket of indices. Consequently, the
prices under these contracts do not track forward natural gas
prices. The fair value of these contracts is determined by
applying the difference between the contract price and the U.K.
forward natural gas strip price to the expected sales volumes
for the next eighteen months under these contracts. Adjustments
to the fair value of these contracts result in non-cash charges
or credits to income from operations. The difference between the
contract price and the U.K. forward natural gas strip price may
fluctuate widely from time to time and may significantly affect
income from operations. The non-cash losses related to changes
in fair value recognized in income from operations were
$386 million in 2005, $99 million in 2004, and
$66 million in 2003. These effects are primarily due to the
U.K.

18-month

forward
natural gas price curve strengthening 90 percent,
36 percent and 26 percent during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Expected Future Taxable Income

We must estimate our expected future taxable income to assess
the realizability of our deferred income tax assets. As of
December 31, 2005, we reported deferred tax assets of
$1.782 billion, which represented gross assets of
$2.409 billion net of valuation allowances of
$627 million.

Numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future
taxable income, including assumptions about matters that are
dependent on future events, such as future operating conditions
(particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas
prices) and future financial conditions. The estimates and
assumptions used in determining future taxable income are
consistent with those used in our internal budgets, forecasts
and strategic plans.

In determining our overall estimated future taxable income for
purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation
allowances, we consider proved and risk-adjusted probable and
possible reserves related to our existing producing properties,
as well as estimated quantities of oil and natural gas related
to undeveloped discoveries if, in our judgment, it is likely
that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable
future. In assessing the propriety of releasing an existing
valuation allowance, we consider the preponderance of evidence
concerning the realization of the impaired deferred tax asset.

Additionally, we must consider any prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred
tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation
allowance recognized against deferred tax assets, if we can
implement these strategies and if we expect to implement these
strategies in the event the forecasted conditions actually
occurred. The principal tax planning strategy available to us
relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries. Assumptions related to the permanent
reinvestment of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are
reconsidered quarterly to give effect to changes in our
portfolio of producing properties and in our tax profile.



Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit
Obligations

Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant
of which relate to the following:

We develop our demographics and utilize the work of third-party
actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We
have selected different discount rates for our funded
U.S. pension plans and our unfunded U.S. retiree
health plans due to the different projected liability durations
of nine years and 13 years. In determining the assumed
discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on
high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party
actuary’s discount rate modeling tool. This tool applies a
yield curve to the projected benefit plan cash flows using a
hypothetical Aa yield curve. The yield curve represents a series
of annualized individual discount rates from 1.5 to
30 years. The bonds used are rated Aa or higher by a
recognized rating agency and only non-callable bonds are
included. Each issue is required to have at least
$150 million par value outstanding. The top quartile bonds
are selected within each maturity group to construct the yield
curve.

The asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of
the plans (currently targeted at approximately 75 percent
equity securities and 25 percent debt securities for the
funded U.S. pension plans), past performance and other
factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with
various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock
yields. Our assumptions are compared to those of peer companies
and to historical returns for reasonableness.

Compensation increase assumptions are based on historical
experience, anticipated future management actions and
demographics of the benefit plans.

Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on
historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of
likely long-term trends.

Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements includes
detailed information for the three years ended December 31,
2005, on the components of pension and other postretirement
benefit expense and the underlying assumptions.

Of the assumptions used to measure the December 31, 2005
obligations and estimated 2006 net periodic benefit cost,
the discount rate has the most significant effect on the
periodic benefit costs reported for the plans. A
..25 percent decrease in the discount rates of
5.50 percent for our domestic pension plan and
5.75 percent for our domestic postretirement benefit plan
would increase pension expense and other postretirement benefit
plan expense by approximately $13 million and
$3 million, respectively.

In 2005, we decreased our retirement age assumption by two years
and also increased our lump sum election rate from
90 percent to 96 percent based on changing trends in
our experience. This change increased our benefit obligations by
approximately $109 million.

Contingent Liabilities

We accrue contingent liabilities for income and other tax
deficiencies, environmental remediation, product liability
claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are
probable and estimable. Actual costs can differ from estimates
for many reasons. For instance, the costs from settlement of
claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing
interpretations of laws, opinions on responsibility and
assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for
environmental remediation may vary because of changes in laws,
regulations and their interpretation; the determination of
additional information on the extent and nature of site
contamination; and improvements in technology. Our in-house
legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities.
In certain circumstances, outside legal counsel is utilized.

A liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we
determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. We
generally record these losses as “Cost of revenues” or
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the
consolidated statements of income, except for tax contingencies,
which are recorded as “Other taxes” or “Provision
for income taxes.” For additional information on contingent
liabilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.”

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings if other
assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not
practical because of the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions



and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of
both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Income and
Operations

Revenues

for each of the last three years are summarized
in the following table:

E&P segment revenues increased by $1.490 billion in
2005 from 2004 and by $119 million in 2004 from 2003. The
2005 increase was primarily due to higher worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon and natural gas prices and international liquid
hydrocarbon sales volumes partially offset by lower domestic
natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. Derivative
losses included in E&P segment revenues totaled
$5 million in 2005, $169 million in 2004 and
$110 million in 2003. Excluded from E&P segment
revenues were losses of $386 million in 2005,
$99 million in 2004 and $66 million in 2003 related to
long-term natural gas sales contracts in the U.K. that are
accounted for as derivative instruments. See “Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”
on page 53. Matching buy/sell transactions decreased by
$44 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $55 million in
2004 from 2003. The 2005 and 2004 decreases were primarily due
to decreased crude oil buy/sell volumes, partially offset by
higher domestic liquid hydrocarbon prices.

RM&T segment revenues increased by $12.373 billion in
2005 from 2004 and by $9.116 billion in 2004 from 2003. The
2005 increase primarily reflected higher refined product and
crude oil prices and increased refined product sales volumes,
partially offset by decreased crude oil sales volumes. The 2004
increase primarily reflected higher refined product and crude
oil prices and increased refined product and crude oil sales
volumes. Matching buy/sell transactions increased by
$3.438 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $2.114 billion
in 2004 from 2003. The 2005 and 2004 increases were primarily
due to increased crude oil prices and volumes and higher refined
product prices and volumes.

IG segment revenues increased by $345 million in 2005 from
2004 and decreased by $509 million in 2004 from 2003. The
increase in 2005 is a result of higher natural gas prices. The
decrease in 2004 is due to a decrease in natural gas marketing
activities, partially offset by higher natural gas prices.
Derivative gains included in IG segment revenues totaled
$13 million in 2005, compared to gains of $17 million
in 2004 and $19 million in 2003.

For additional information on segment results, see the
discussion on income from operations on page 39.

Income from equity method investments

increased by
$96 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $141 million in
2004 from 2003. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to higher
income from Alba Plant, LLC as a result of higher LPG and
condensate production volume and higher income from PTC as a
result of higher distillate gross margins. The increase in 2004
resulted from a $124 million loss on the dissolution of MKM
Partners L.P. recorded in 2003. Results for 2004 also include
increased earnings of other equity method investments, primarily
AMPCO.

Cost of revenues

increased by $7.107 billion in 2005
from 2004 and by $5.840 billion in 2004 from 2003. The
increases are primarily in the RM&T segment and resulted
from an increase in acquisition costs for crude oil, an increase
in the cost of refined product purchases, an increase in the
cost of other refinery charge and blend stocks and higher
manufacturing expenses, primarily the result of higher purchased
energy and depreciation.

Purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions

increased by $3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 and
$1.837 billion in 2004 from 2003, primarily in the RM&T
segment. The increases in both years are primarily due to



increased crude oil prices. Differences between revenues from
matching buy/sell transactions and purchases related to matching
buy/sell transactions are primarily grade/quality and location
differentials.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased by
$133 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $105 million in
2004 from 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily a result of
increased stock-based compensation expense due to the increase
in the stock price during the year as well as an increase in
equity-based awards. This was partially offset by a decrease as
a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and

start-up

costs related
to EGHoldings in 2004. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to
increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated
with business transformation and outsourcing. Our 2004 results
were also impacted by the

start-up

costs
discussed above and the increased cost of complying with
governmental regulations.

Other taxes

increased by $144 million in 2005 from
2004 and increased $39 million in 2004 from 2003. The
increase in 2005 is primarily a result of increased payments of
mineral extraction tax and export duty in Russia due to higher
sales volumes and crude oil prices.

Net interest and other financial costs

decreased by
$16 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $25 million in
2004 from 2003. The decrease in 2005 is primarily a result of
increased interest income on higher average cash balances and
capitalized interest, partially offset by increased interest on
potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses.
The decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest
income on higher cash balances. Included in net interest and
other financing costs are foreign currency losses of
$17 million, and gains of $9 million and
$13 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Minority interest in income of MPC

decreased by
$148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to the acquisition of
Ashland’s 38 percent interest in MPC on June 30,
2005.

Provision for income taxes

increased by
$1.003 billion in 2005 from 2004 and by $143 million
in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to $2.797 billion and
$388 million increases in income from continuing operations
before income taxes.

The effective tax rate for 2005 was 36.2 percent compared
to 36.6 percent for both 2004 and 2003. The following is an

benefit of $8 million. Also, included in 2003 results is an
$8 million adjustment to a tax liability due to United
States Steel Corporation.

Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles

in
2005 was an unfavorable effect of $19 million, net of taxes
of $12 million, representing the adoption of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”)
No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations – an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143,” as of December 31, 2005. The cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in 2003 was a
favorable effect of $4 million, net of taxes of
$4 million, representing the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”



Income from operations

for each of the last three years
is summarized in the following table:



Average Volumes, Selling Prices and Other Statistics



Domestic E&P income

increased by $491 million in
2005 from 2004 following a decrease of $82 million in 2004
from 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher
natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon prices partially offset by
lower sales volumes. The lower volumes in 2005 resulted
primarily from weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico
and natural declines in field production rates. The decrease in
2004 was due to lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas volumes
primarily resulting from natural field declines, weather-related
downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and the sale of the Yates field
in late 2003, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon and
natural gas prices. Derivative losses totaled $5 million in
2005, compared to $118 million in 2004 and $91 million
in 2003.

Our cost of storm-related repairs as a result of 2005 hurricane
activity in the Gulf of Mexico was not significant. Our Gulf of
Mexico production has returned to pre-storm levels. In late
September 2004, certain production platforms in the Gulf of
Mexico were evacuated due to hurricane activity. All facilities
were back on line by October 1, 2004 with the exception of
the Petronius platform which came back on line in March 2005. As
a result of the damage to the Petronius platform, we recorded
expense of $11 million in 2004 representing repair costs
incurred, partially offset by the net effects of the property
damage insurance recoveries and the related retrospective
insurance premiums. We recorded income of $53 million in
2005 and $34 million in 2004 for business interruption
insurance recoveries.

Our domestic average realized liquid hydrocarbons price
excluding derivative activity was $45.41 per barrel
(“bbl”) in 2005, compared to $32.76 per bbl in
2004 and $27.02 per bbl in 2003. Domestic average natural
gas prices were $6.42 per thousand cubic feet
(“mcf”) excluding derivative activity in 2005,
compared with $4.89 per mcf in 2004 and $4.53 per mcf
in 2003.

Domestic net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes decreased to 76
thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in 2005, down
6 percent from 2004 primarily as a result of storm-related
downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and natural field declines in the
Permian Basin. Domestic net natural gas sales volumes averaged
578 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”), down
8 percent from 2004, primarily as a result of lower
production in the Permian Basin and Camden Hills in the Gulf of
Mexico due to natural field declines and downtime associated
with Hurricane Ivan. Domestic net liquid hydrocarbon sales
volumes decreased 27 percent to 81 mbpd in 2004 from 2003
as a result of natural declines mainly in the Gulf of Mexico,
hurricane damage to the Petronius platform and the sale of the
Yates field in November 2003. Domestic net natural gas sales
volumes decreased 14 percent to 631 mmcfd in 2004 from 2003
as a result of hurricane damage to the Petronius platform and
natural declines in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico.

International E&P income

increased by
$801 million in 2005 from 2004 and by $198 million in
2004 from 2003. The increase in 2005 was primarily the result of
higher product prices and liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes,
partially offset by higher production taxes in Russia, dry well
expenses and lower natural gas sales volumes. The increase in
2004 was primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural
gas prices and volumes partially offset by higher derivative
losses. Derivative losses totaled $386 million in 2005,
compared to $51 million in 2004 and $19 million in
2003.

Our international average realized liquid hydrocarbon price
excluding derivative activity was $45.43 per bbl in 2005,
compared with $33.68 per bbl in 2004 and $26.24 per
bbl in 2003. International average gas prices were
$4.28 per mcf excluding derivative activity in 2005,
compared with $3.33 per mcf in 2004 and $2.80 per mcf
in 2003.

International net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased to
115 mbpd in 2005, up 29 percent from 2004, as a result of
increased production in Equatorial Guinea and Russia.
International net natural gas sales volumes averaged 354 mmcfd
in 2005, down 4 percent from 2004, primarily as a result of
reduced U.K. spot gas sales. International net liquid
hydrocarbon sales volumes increased 11 percent to 89 mbpd
in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to increased production in
Equatorial Guinea and a full year of production from Khanty
Mansiysk Oil Corporation (“KMOC”) which was acquired
in 2003. International net natural gas sales volumes averaged
368 mmcfd, up 1 percent from 2003 due to increased
production from the condensate expansion project in Equatorial
Guinea, offset by the disposition in 2003 of our interest in
CLAM.

RM&T segment income

increased by $1.607 billion
in 2005 from 2004 and by $587 million in 2004 from 2003.
The increases were primarily due to higher refining and
wholesale marketing margins. The refining and wholesale
marketing margin in 2005 averaged 15.8 cents per gallon, versus
a 2004 level of 8.8 cents and a 2003 level of 6.0 cents. Margins
improved initially in 2005 due to wider sweet/sour crude
differentials, and more recently, due to the temporary impact
that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had on refined product margins
and concerns about the adequacy of distillate supplies heading
into winter. Margins improved initially in 2004 due to the
market’s concerns about refiners’ ability to supply
the new Tier II low sulfur gasolines which were required
effective January 1, 2004. We also benefited from wider
sweet/sour crude differentials in 2004. We averaged
973,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per day in 2005, or
102 percent of average system capacity. We averaged
939,000 barrels of crude oil throughput per day in 2004 and
917,000 in 2003, representing 99 percent and
98 percent of average system capacity for those years.



The portion of derivative losses included in the refining and
wholesale marketing margin were $238 million in 2005
compared to $272 million in 2004 and $158 million in
2003. Generally, losses on derivatives included in the refining
and wholesale marketing margin are offset by gains on the
underlying physical transactions. These derivative losses were
primarily incurred to mitigate the price risk of certain crude
oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of
excess inventories and to protect crack spread values.

IG segment income

decreased by $17 million in 2005
from 2004, following an increase of $51 million in 2004
from 2003. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to increased
income taxes for AMPCO as a result of the expiration of a tax
holiday. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased
earnings from our investment in AMPCO and higher income from our
Alaska LNG operations, partially offset by costs associated with
ongoing development of certain integrated gas projects and lower
margins from gas marketing activities, including recognized
changes in the fair value of derivatives used to support those
activities. Additionally, the 2003 results included an
impairment charge of $22 million on an equity method
investment and a loss of $17 million on the termination of
two operating leases for tankers used in our Alaska LNG
operations. The AMPCO methanol plant in Equatorial Guinea
operated at a 98 percent on-stream factor in 2005 and a
95 percent on-stream factor in 2004, and posted index
prices for methanol remained strong.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity

Financial Condition

Both our acquisition of the minority interest in MPC and our
re-entry to Libya discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated
financial statements had a significant impact on our
December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet. The MPC
transaction closed June 30, 2005 and was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting. As a result, we
established a new accounting basis for the tangible and
identifiable intangible net assets of MPC to the extent of the
38 percent of MPC not previously owned by us, based on the
estimated fair values of those net assets as of June 30,
2005. On December 29, 2005, we entered into an agreement
with the National Oil Corporation of Libya to return to our oil
and natural gas exploration and production operations in the
Waha concessions in Libya. This transaction was also accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting.

Changes in the consolidated balance sheets from 2004 to 2005
were significantly impacted by the acquisitions noted above. For
additional information on the effects of both of these
transactions on our financial condition, see Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements. Other significant changes in
the consolidated balance sheets are noted below.

Net property, plant and equipment increased $3.201 billion
from year-end 2004 due to the acquisitions noted above as well
as the projects in Equatorial Guinea and the Alvheim development
offshore Norway affecting International E&P, the Detroit
refinery expansion affecting RM&T and the EG LNG plant
affecting IG. Net property, plant and equipment for each of the
last two years is summarized in the following table:

Asset retirement obligations increased $234 million from
year-end 2004 primarily due to upward revisions of previous
estimates primarily in the U.K. and Ireland, a change in the
Gabon production sharing contract that created a retirement
obligation and adoption of FIN No. 47 related to
conditional asset retirement obligations on December 31,
2005.

Cash Flows

Net cash provided from operating activities (for continuing
operations)

totaled $4.738 billion in 2005, compared
with $3.766 billion in 2004 and $2.765 billion in
2003. The 2005 increase mainly resulted from higher net income,
partially offset by the effects of receivables which were
transferred to Ashland at the Acquisition date. The 2004
increase was primarily the result of working capital changes.



Capital expenditures

for each of the last three years are
summarized in the following table:

Capital expenditures in 2005 totaled $2.890 billion
compared with $2.247 billion in 2004 and
$1.909 billion in 2003. The $643 million increase in
2005 mainly resulted from increased spending in the E&P
segments related to the Alvheim development offshore Norway and
in the IG segment associated with the EG LNG plant. The increase
of $338 million in 2004 from 2003 mainly resulted from
increased spending in the IG segment associated with the EG LNG
plant.

Acquisitions

included cash payments of $506 million
in 2005 for the acquisition of Ashland’s 38 percent
ownership in MPC and $252 million in 2003 for the
acquisition of KMOC. For further discussion of acquisitions, see
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Cash from disposal of assets

was $131 million in
2005, compared with $76 million in 2004 and
$1.256 billion in 2003 which includes the disposal of
discontinued operations. In 2005 and 2004, proceeds were
primarily from the sale of various domestic producing properties
and SSA stores. In 2003, proceeds were primarily from the
disposition of our E&P properties in western Canada, the
Yates field and gathering system, various SSA stores and other
interests and producing properties.

Net cash used in financing activities

totaled
$2.345 billion in 2005, compared with net cash provided of
$527 million in 2004 and net cash used of $888 million
in 2003. The change from 2004 to 2005 was primarily related to
the repayment of $1.920 billion of debt assumed as a part
of the Acquisition in 2005 and to the issuance of
34,500,000 shares of common stock on March 31, 2004,
resulting in net proceeds of $1.004 billion in 2004. The
change also included an increase in dividends paid and
$272 million of distributions to the minority shareholder
of MPC prior to the Acquisition, net of an increase in
contributions from the minority shareholders of EGHoldings. The
increase in 2004 was due to the net proceeds from the common
stock issuance discussed above as well as the suspension of
distributions to the minority shareholder of MPC in 2004. This
was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to
stockholders.

Derivative Instruments

See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk” on page 53, for a discussion of derivative
instruments and associated market risk.

Dividends to Stockholders

Dividends of $1.22 per common share or $436 million
were paid during 2005. On January 29, 2006, our Board of
Directors declared a dividend of 33 cents per share on our
common stock, payable March 10, 2006, to stockholders of
record at the close of business on February 16, 2006.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are
internally generated cash flow from operations, committed credit
facilities and access to both the debt and equity capital
markets. Our ability to access the debt capital market is
supported by our investment grade credit ratings. Our senior
unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard
and Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services,
Inc. and Fitch Ratings with ratings of BBB+, Baa1, and BBB+.
Because of the liquidity and capital resource alternatives
available to us, including internally generated cash flow, we
believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate
to fund operations, including our capital spending programs,
stock repurchase program, repayment of debt maturities for the
years 2006, 2007 and 2008, and any amounts that may ultimately
be paid in connection with contingencies.

We have a committed $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit
facility that terminates in May 2009. At December 31, 2005,
there were no borrowings against this facility. At
December 31, 2005, we had no commercial



paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program
that is backed by the five-year revolving credit facility.

MPC has a committed $500 million five-year revolving credit
facility with third-party financial institutions that terminates
in May 2009. At December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings
against this facility.

As a condition of the closing agreements for the Acquisition, we
are required to maintain MPC on a stand-alone basis financially
for a two-year period. During this period of time, capital
contributions into MPC are prohibited and MPC is prohibited from
incurring additional debt, except for borrowings under an
existing intercompany loan facility to fund an expansion project
at MPC’s Detroit refinery and in the event of limited
extraordinary circumstances. MPC may only use its revolving
credit facility for short-term working capital requirements in a
manner consistent with past practices. There are no restrictions
against MPC making intercompany loans or declaring dividends to
its parent. We believe these facilities and cash provided from
MPC’s operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity
requirements.

As of December 31, 2005, there was $1.7 billion
aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other
equity securities, debt securities, trust preferred securities
or other securities, including securities convertible into or
exchangeable for other equity or debt securities available to be
issued under the $2.7 billion universal shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
2002. On June 30, 2005, we issued $955 million of
common stock to Ashland shareholders through a separate
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which was declared effective May 20, 2005.

Our cash-adjusted

debt-to

-capital ratio
(total-debt-minus-cash to total-debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was
11 percent at December 31, 2005, compared to
8 percent at year-end 2004 as shown below. This includes
$543 million of debt that is serviced by United States
Steel. We continually monitor our spending levels, market
conditions and related interest rates to maintain what we
perceive to be reasonable debt levels.

On December 29, 2005, in conjunction with our partners in
the former Oasis Group, we entered into an agreement with the
National Oil Corporation of Libya to return to our oil and
natural gas exploration and production operations in the Waha
concessions in Libya. The re-entry terms include a

25-year

extension of
the concessions to 2030 through 2034 and a payment of
$520 million from us, which was made in January 2006. An
additional payment estimated to be approximately
$212 million is payable by us within one year of the
agreement date.

On January 29, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock over a
period of two years. Such purchases will be made during this
period as our financial condition and market conditions warrant.
Any purchases under the program may be in either open market
transactions, including block purchases, or in privately
negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not include
specific price targets, and is subject to termination prior to
completion. We will use cash on hand, cash generated from
operations, or cash from available borrowings to acquire shares.
Shares of stock repurchased under the program will be held as
treasury shares.



The table below provides aggregated information on our
obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as
of December 31, 2005:

Summary of Contractual Cash Obligations

(a)

Upon the Separation, United States Steel assumed certain debt
    and lease obligations. Such amounts are included in the above
    table because Marathon remains primarily liable.

(b)

We anticipate cash payments for interest of $255 million
    for 2006, $432 million for 2007-2008, $385 million for
    2009-2010 and $1.658 billion for the remaining years for a
    total of $2.730 billion.

Contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement
amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded from
the above table. These include derivative contracts that are
sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other
factors.

Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements includes
detailed information for the three years ended December 31,
2005, on the funded status for our pension plans as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004. Under prescribed regulatory
minimum funding requirements, we have satisfied the minimum
funding obligations related to the pension plans and therefore
no contributions are required from us. However, we plan to make
discretionary cash contributions of between $155 million
and $345 million in 2006.



Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail
ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in
the above forward-looking statements are based on currently
available information. If this information proves to be
inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely
affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing
include our performance (as measured by various factors
including cash provided from operating activities), the state of
worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and
expectations of past and future performance, the global
financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to
borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit
ratings by rating agencies.

The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase
program are based on current expectations, estimates and
projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual
results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates
and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties
and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are
difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand
for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of
competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or
refining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather
conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental
or military response thereto, and other operating and economic
considerations.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that
may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and
results of operations, even though such arrangements are not
recorded as liabilities under generally accepted accounting
principles. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a
variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these
arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources;
and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably
likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a
material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.

We have provided various forms of guarantees to unconsolidated
affiliates, United States Steel and certain lease contracts.
These arrangements are described in Note 28 to the
consolidated financial statements.

We are a party to an agreement that would require us to
purchase, under certain circumstances, the interest in Pilot
Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”) not currently owned. This
put/call agreement is described in Note 28 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Nonrecourse Indebtedness of
    Investees

Certain of our investees have incurred indebtedness that we do
not support through guarantees or otherwise. If we were
obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis,
our share would have been approximately $308 million as of
December 31, 2005. Of this amount, $183 million
relates to PTC. If any of these investees default, we have no
obligation to support the debt. Our partner in PTC has
guaranteed $125 million of the total PTC debt.

Obligations Associated with
    the Separation of United States Steel

On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business
through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our
wholly owned subsidiary, United States Steel, to holders of our
USX – U.S. Steel Group class of common stock in
exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a
one-for-one basis.

We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for certain debt
and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel
has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the
Separation. United States Steel’s obligations to Marathon
are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United
States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured
obligations. If United States Steel fails to satisfy these
obligations, we would become responsible for repayment. Under
the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has all of
the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from
Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options,
prepayments or the grant or release of security interests.
However, United States Steel has no right to increase amounts
due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases,
other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed
leases.

As of December 31, 2005, we have identified the following
obligations totaling $597 million that have been assumed by
United States Steel:

•

$428 million of industrial revenue bonds related to
    environmental improvement projects for current and former United
    States Steel facilities, with maturities ranging from 2009
    through 2033. Accrued interest payable on these bonds was
    $9 million at December 31, 2005.

•

$66 million of sale-leaseback financing under a lease for
    equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works, with a
    term extending to 2012, subject to extensions. There was no
    accrued interest payable on this financing at December 31,
    2005.



•

$49 million of obligations under a lease for equipment at
    United States Steel’s Clairton cokemaking facility, with a
    term extending to 2012. There was no accrued interest payable on
    this financing at December 31, 2005.

•

$45 million of operating lease obligations, of which
    $37 million was in turn assumed by purchasers of major
    equipment used in plants and operations divested by United
    States Steel.

•

A guarantee of all obligations of United States Steel as general
    partner of Clairton 1314B Partnership, L.P. to the limited
    partners. United States Steel has reported that it currently has
    no unpaid outstanding obligations to the limited partners. For
    further discussion of the Clairton 1314B guarantee, see
    Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Of the total $597 million, obligations of $552 million
and corresponding receivables from United States Steel were
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2005 (current portion –
$20 million; long-term portion –
$532 million). The remaining $45 million was related
to off-balance sheet arrangements and contingent liabilities of
United States Steel.

The table below provides aggregated information on the portion
of our obligations to make future payments under existing
contracts that have been assumed by United States Steel as of
December 31, 2005:

    assumed by United States Steel.

Each of Marathon and United States Steel, as members of the same
consolidated tax reporting group during taxable periods ended on
or before December 31, 2001, is jointly and severally
liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire
consolidated tax reporting group for those periods. Marathon and
United States Steel have entered into a tax sharing agreement
that allocates tax liabilities relating to taxable periods ended
on or before December 31, 2001. The agreement includes
indemnification provisions to address the possibility that the
taxing authorities may seek to collect a tax liability from one
party where the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability
to the other party. In 2005, in accordance with the terms of the
tax sharing agreement, we paid $6 million to United States
Steel in connection with the settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service of the consolidated federal income tax returns
of USX Corporation for the years 1995 through 1997.

United States Steel reported in its
Form

10-K

for the
year ended December 31, 2005, that it has significant
restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including
cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses on selected debt
that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and
liquidity. However, United States Steel management believes that
its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for
the foreseeable future.

Transactions with Related
    Parties

We own a 63 percent working interest in the Alba field
offshore EG. We own a 52 percent interest in an onshore LPG
processing plant in EG through an equity method investee, Alba
Plant LLC. Additionally, we own a 45 percent interest in an
onshore methanol production plant through AMPCO, an equity
method investee. We sell our marketed natural gas from the Alba
field to Alba Plant LLC and AMPCO. AMPCO uses the natural gas to
manufacture methanol and sells the methanol through another
equity method investee, AMPCO Marketing LLC.

Sales to our 50 percent equity method investee, PTC, which
consists primarily of refined petroleum products, accounted for
less than two percent of our total sales revenue for 2005, 2004
and 2003. PTC is the largest travel center network in the United
States and operates approximately 260 travel centers nationwide.
We also sell refined petroleum products consisting mainly of
petrochemicals, base lube oils, and asphalt to Ashland which
owned a 38 percent interest in MPC prior to the
Acquisition. Our sales to Ashland accounted for less than one
percent of our total sales revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003. We
believe that these transactions were conducted under terms
comparable to those with unrelated parties.



Marathon holds a 60 percent economic interest, GEPetrol
holds a 25 percent economic interest, Mitsui holds an
8.5 percent economic interest and Marubeni holds a
6.5 percent economic interest in EGHoldings. As of
December 31, 2005, total expenditures of
$1.116 billion, including $1.066 billion of capital
expenditures, related to the LNG project have been incurred.
Cash of $57 million held in escrow to fund future
contributions from GEPetrol is classified as restricted cash and
is included in investments and long-term receivables. Payables
to related parties include $57 million payable to GEPetrol.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental
Matters, Litigation and Contingencies

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital,
operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a
result of environmental laws and regulations. If these
expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately recovered in
the prices of our products and services, operating results will
be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our
competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and
regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may
vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and
location of its operating facilities, marketing areas,
production processes and whether it is also engaged in the
petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil
and refined products.

Our environmental expenditures for each of the last three years
were

Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for
13 percent of total capital expenditures in 2005,
19 percent in 2004 and 17 percent in 2003.

We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the
responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of
associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental
remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as
additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of
those previously accrued may be required.

New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase
our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We comply with
all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not
all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under
existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation
or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the
ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that
may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.

Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be
approximately $218 million or 7 percent of capital
expenditures in 2006. Predictions beyond 2006 can only be
broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to
vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory
requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent
requirements and the availability of new technologies, among
other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we
anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be
approximately $147 million in 2007; however, actual
expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental
projects are revised as a result of improved technology or
changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if
additional projects are identified or additional requirements
are imposed.

Of particular significance to our refining operations are EPA
regulations that require reduced sulfur levels starting in 2004
for gasoline and in 2006 for diesel fuel. Our combined capital
costs to achieve compliance with these rules are expected to
approximate $900 million over the period between 2002 and
2006, which includes costs that could be incurred as part of
other refinery upgrade projects. Costs incurred through
December 31, 2005, were approximately $825 million,
with the remainder expected to be incurred in 2006. This is a
forward-looking statement. Some factors (among others) that
could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance
costs include completion of construction and

start-up

activities.

During 2001, MPC entered into a New Source Review consent decree
and settlement of alleged CAA and other violations with the EPA
covering all of MPC’s refineries. The settlement committed
MPC to specific control technologies and implementation
schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to
MPC’s refineries over approximately an eight-year period.
The total one-time expenditures for these environmental projects
are



approximately $420 million over the eight-year period, with
about $265 million incurred through December 31, 2005.
The impact of the settlement on ongoing operating expenses is
expected to be immaterial. In addition, MPC has nearly completed
certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part
of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA
violations, at a cost of $9 million. We believe this
settlement will provide MPC with increased permitting and
operating flexibility while achieving significant emission
reductions. In 2005, MPC entered into two amendments of the
consent decree which captured all revisions to the decree agreed
to with the EPA since 2001. The revisions related to use of
additives and control technologies along with schedule
adjustments and other changes. The costs of these consent decree
revisions are immaterial and are included in the cost estimates
provided in this paragraph.

For information on legal proceedings related to environmental
matters, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

Outlook

Capital, Investment and Exploration Budget

We approved a capital, investment and exploration budget of
$3.4 billion for 2006, which includes budgeted capital
expenditures of $3.2 billion. This represents a
13 percent increase over 2005 actual spending. The primary
focus of the 2006 budget is to find additional oil and natural
gas reserves, develop existing fields, strengthen RM&T
assets and continue implementation of the integrated gas
strategy. The budget includes worldwide production capital
spending of $1.357 billion primarily in the United States,
Norway, Russia, Equatorial Guinea and Ireland. The worldwide
exploration budget of $588 million includes plans to drill
19 significant exploration wells. Other activities will focus on
projects primarily within or adjacent to our onshore producing
properties in the United States. The budget includes
$886 million for RM&T, primarily for refining
investments targeting value-added projects primarily aimed at
de-bottlenecking various refining components to increase
throughput capacity, as well as investments necessary to meet
revised EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards, best
achievable control technology and Tier II Clean Fuels
regulations. Also included in the budget for RM&T is planned
spending for the FEED work being undertaken for the potential
180,000 bpd Garyville, Louisiana refinery expansion
project. The IG budget of $341 million is primarily for the
ongoing construction of the EG LNG plant. The remaining
$210 million balance is designated for capitalized interest
and corporate activities. This budget does not include the 2006
cash payments related to our re-entry to Libya, estimated to be
$732 million.

Exploration and Production

Our eight discoveries in 2005 resulted from our balanced
exploration strategy which places an emphasis on near-term
production opportunities, while retaining an appropriate
exposure to longer-term options. Major exploration activities,
which are currently underway or under evaluation, include those
in:



During 2005, we continued to make progress in advancing key
development projects that will help serve as the basis for our
production growth profile in the coming years. Major development
and production activities currently underway or under evaluation
include those in:

In January 2006, we began to experience pipeline operational
problems related to the increasing water production associated
with the natural gas production from the Camden Hills field in
the Gulf of Mexico. If these issues cannot be resolved, we may
need to impair some or all of the carrying value of the field
and the associated Canyon Express pipeline. At December 31,
2005, the combined carrying value of those assets approximated
$20 million.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with
respect to the timing and levels of our worldwide liquid
hydrocarbon and natural gas production, future exploration and
drilling activity, possible development of Blocks 31 and 32
offshore Angola, the Neptune development, the Alvheim/ Vilje
development and estimated levels of production in Libya. Some
factors that could potentially affect this forward-looking
information include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum
products, amount of capital available for exploration and
development, occurrence of acquisitions/dispositions of oil and
gas properties, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing
production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen
hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist
acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and
other geological, operating and economic considerations. The
estimated levels of production in Libya and possible development
of Blocks 31 and 32 offshore Angola could further be
affected by presently known data concerning size and character
of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success
and production experience. The foregoing factors (among others)
could cause actual results to differ materially from those set
forth in the forward-looking statements.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Throughout 2005, we remained focused on our strategy of
leveraging refining and marketing investments in core markets,
as well as expanding and enhancing our asset base while
controlling costs. The record refinery throughput performance
was achieved even though the Garyville, Louisiana and Texas
City, Texas refineries were shut down briefly due to Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita. Based on our current plans, we expect our 2006
average crude oil throughput to exceed that achieved in 2005.

The Detroit refinery expansion was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2005. This project increased the refinery’s
crude processing capacity from 74,000 bpd to
100,000 bpd as well as enabled the refinery to produce new
clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. The
refinery ramped up to full capacity of 100,000 bpd in
mid-November.

We plan to evaluate a 180,000 bpd expansion of the
245,000 bpd Garyville, Louisiana refinery. The initial
phase of the potential expansion includes FEED work which began
in December 2005 and could lead to the start of



construction in 2007. The project, currently estimated to cost
approximately $2.2 billion, could be completed as early as
the fourth quarter of 2009. The final investment decision is
subject to completion of the FEED work and the receipt of
applicable permits.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with
respect to projections of crude oil throughput, the Garyville,
Louisiana refinery expansion project, and other related
businesses. Some factors that could affect crude oil throughput
include planned and unplanned refinery maintenance projects, the
level of refining margins, and other operating considerations.
The Garyville refinery expansion project may be affected by the
results of the FEED work, necessary regulatory approvals, crude
oil supply and transportation logistics, the receipt of
applicable permits, continued favorable investment climate, as
well as availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards
such as weather conditions, and other risks customarily
associated with construction projects once construction begins.
The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results
to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements.

Integrated Gas

Construction of the EG LNG plant is ahead of schedule with
shipment of first cargoes of LNG expected in the third quarter
of 2007. This project is expected to be one of the lowest cost
LNG operations in the Atlantic basin with an all-in LNG
operating, capital and feedstock cost of approximately
$1 per million British thermal units (“mmbtu”) at
the loading flange of the LNG plant. Efforts are underway to
acquire additional natural gas supply and expand the utilization
of this LNG facility above and beyond the contract to supply
3.4 million metric tons per year to BG Gas Marketing Ltd.
for 17 years. We also are seeking additional natural gas
supplies in the area to expand the capacity and life of this
plant and that could lead to the development of a second LNG
train.

Under the five-year BP supply agreement, BP will supply us with
58 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per year,
as LNG. We will take delivery of the LNG at the Elba Island
terminal where we hold rights to deliver and sell up to 58 bcf
of natural gas per year, with pricing linked to the Henry Hub
index. This supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our
capacity rights at Elba Island during the period of this
agreement, while affording us the flexibility to access this
capacity to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources
beyond the term of the BP contract. The agreement commenced in
2005.

In 2006, we plan to continue exploring and investing in gas
technology research, including GTL technology, which was
successfully applied in the Catoosa GTL demonstration plant in
2004. In addition to GTL, we are continuing to explore gas
technologies, including methanol to power, gas to fuels and
compressed natural gas technologies.

The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with
respect to a LNG project and possible expansion thereof. Factors
that could affect the LNG project and related facilities include
unforeseen problems arising from construction, inability or
delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party
approvals, unanticipated changes in market demand or supply,
environmental issues, availability or construction of sufficient
LNG vessels, and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions.
In addition to these factors, other factors that could affect
the possible expansion of the LNG project and the development of
additional LNG capacity through additional projects include
partner approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes
through exploration or commercial negotiations with other
resource owners and access to sufficient regasification
capacity. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause
actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements.

Corporate

Higher foreign income taxes are expected to result from our
Libyan operations, where the effective tax rate is in excess of
90 percent, and an increase in the U.K. supplemental
corporation tax rate from 10 percent to 20 percent
effective January 1, 2006. Also increasing our overall
effective tax rate are the incremental taxes associated with the
expected repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S.

Since 2003, the variable component of our stock-based
compensation awards has had a significant impact on our income
from operations. We recognize stock-based compensation expense
based on the difference between the market price and the grant
price of these variable awards each reporting period until
settlement. During 2005, we experienced a 66 percent
increase in the market price of our common stock. As a result,
we recognized $69 million in stock-based compensation
expense compared to $30 million for 2004. Due to exercises
of these awards during 2005, the number of outstanding variable
awards decreased approximately 74 percent. We expect that
this change will reduce the impact these variable awards will
have on stock-based compensation expense in 2006.



Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) as a
revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” This statement requires entities
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of
the award on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over
the period during which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period.
In addition, awards classified as liabilities will be remeasured
each reporting period. In 2003, we adopted the fair value method
for grants made, modified or settled on or after January 1,
2003. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 123(R) to have a material effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. The statement provided for an effective date of
July 1, 2005, for us. However, in April 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that, for us,
defers the effective date until January 1, 2006. We adopted
the provisions of this statement January 1, 2006.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4.” This statement requires that
items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double
freight, and re-handling costs be recognized as a current-period
charge. We are required to implement this statement in the first
quarter of 2006. We do not expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 151 to have a material effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”
SFAS No. 154 requires companies to recognize
(1) voluntary changes in accounting principle and
(2) changes required by a new accounting pronouncement,
when the pronouncement does not include specific transition
provisions, retrospectively to prior periods’ financial
statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.
SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005.

In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by
the Emerging Issues Task Force regarding Issue No. 04-13,
“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
Same Counterparty.” The issue defines when a purchase and a
sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same
line of business is recorded at fair value or considered a
single nonmonetary transaction subject to the fair value
exception of APB Opinion No. 29. The purchase and sale
transactions may be pursuant to a single contractual arrangement
or separate contractual arrangements and the inventory purchased
or sold may be in the form of raw materials,

work-in

-process, or
finished goods. In general, two or more transactions with the
same party are treated as one if they are entered into in
contemplation of each other. The rules apply to new arrangements
entered into in reporting periods beginning after March 15,
2006. We are currently studying the provisions of this consensus
to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments – an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 133 and 140.” SFAS No. 155 simplifies
the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments,
eliminates the FASB’s interim guidance which provides that
beneficial interests in securitized financial assets are not
subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” and eliminates the restriction on the passive
derivative instruments that a qualifying special-purpose entity
may hold. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an
entity’s first fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006. We are currently studying the
provisions of this Statement to determine the impact on our
consolidated financial statements.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk

Management Opinion Concerning Derivative Instruments

Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps
and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations in
commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange
rates.

We use commodity-based derivatives to manage price risk related
to the purchase, production or sale of crude oil, natural gas,
and refined products. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to the
risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum
feedstocks used as raw materials, and purchases of ethanol.

Our strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for
our products and allow operating results to reflect market price
movements dictated by supply and demand. We use a variety of
derivative instruments, including option combinations, as part
of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price
risk in our different businesses. As market conditions change,
we evaluate our risk management program and could enter into
strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of
commodity-based derivatives will be based on market prices.

Our E&P segment primarily uses commodity derivative
instruments selectively to protect against price decreases on
portions of our future production when deemed advantageous to do
so. We also use derivatives to protect the value of natural gas
purchased and injected into storage in support of production
operations. We use financial derivative instruments to manage
foreign currency exchange rate exposure on foreign currency
denominated capital expenditures, operating expenses and tax
payments.

Our RM&T segment uses commodity derivative instruments:

•

to mitigate the price risk:

Our IG segment is exposed to market risk associated with the
purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas. We use commodity
derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased
volumes and anticipated sales volumes. We use financial
derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate
exposure on foreign currency denominated capital expenditures.

We use financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate
exposures. As we enter into these derivatives, assessments are
made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge
accounting.

We believe that use of derivative instruments along with risk
assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose us
to material risk. However, the use of derivative instruments
could materially affect our results of operations in particular
quarterly or annual periods. We believe that use of these
instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial
position or liquidity.

E&P Segment

Derivative losses included in the E&P segment were
$5 million in 2005 compared to $169 million in 2004
and $110 million in 2003. Additionally, losses from
discontinued cash flow hedges of $3 million are included in
2004 segment results, compared to losses of $8 million in
2003. The discontinued cash flow hedge amounts were reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as it was no
longer probable that the original forecasted transactions would
occur.

Excluded from the E&P segment results were losses of
$386 million in 2005, $99 million in 2004 and
$66 million in 2003 on long-term gas contracts in the U.K.
that are accounted for as derivative instruments. For additional
information on U.K. gas contracts, see “Fair Value
Estimates” on page 34.

During 2005, we have remained exposed to market prices of
commodities. In 2004, we reduced our exposure to market prices
of commodities on 26 percent of crude oil production and
7 percent of natural gas production. In 2003, we reduced
our exposure to market prices of commodities on 25 percent
of crude oil production and 22 percent of natural gas
production.

At December 31, 2005, we had no open derivative contracts
related to our oil and gas production and therefore remain
exposed to market prices of commodities. We continue to evaluate
the commodity price risks related to our production and may
enter into commodity derivative instruments when it is deemed
advantageous. As a particular but not exclusive example, we may
elect to use derivative instruments to achieve minimum price
levels on some portion of our production to support capital or
acquisition funding requirements.



RM&T Segment

We do not attempt to qualify commodity derivative instruments
used in our RM&T operations for hedge accounting. As a
result, we recognize in income all changes in the fair value of
derivatives used in our RM&T operations. Derivative gains or
losses included in RM&T segment income for each of the last
three years are summarized in the following table:

Derivatives used in non-trading activities have an underlying
physical commodity transaction. Derivative losses occur when
market prices increase, and generally are offset by gains on the
underlying physical commodity transactions. Conversely,
derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, and
generally are offset by losses on the underlying physical
commodity transactions.

In 2005, we realized an $87 million loss on derivative
instruments associated with trading activities primarily as a
result of unanticipated changes in crude oil and refined product
prices.

IG Segment

We have used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price
of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. The
underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity
of gas and matures in 2008. Similarly, we will use derivative
instruments to convert shorter term (typically less than a year)
fixed price contracts to market prices in our ongoing purchase
for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into
storage for subsequent resale. Derivative gains included in IG
segment income were $12 million in 2005, $17 million
in 2004 and $19 million in 2003. Trading activity in the IG
segment resulted in losses of $1 million in 2005,
$2 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003 which have
been included in the aforementioned amounts.

Other Commodity Risk

We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the
relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in
derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of
the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are
frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from
prices experienced in local markets. For example, New York
Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) contracts for natural
gas are priced at Louisiana’s Henry Hub, while the
underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in
the western United States at prices that do not move in strict
correlation with NYMEX prices. If commodity price changes in one
region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity
instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting
in increased exposure to basis risk. These regional price
differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results.
Over-the counter (“OTC”) transactions are being used
to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk.

We are impacted by liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in
liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to
identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting
position. Due to the large number of active participants,
liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded
transactions.



Interest Rate Risk

We are impacted by interest rate fluctuations which affect the
fair value of certain financial instruments. A sensitivity
analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical
10 percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the
following table:

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our portfolio of long-term
debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments.
Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively
sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations. This
sensitivity is illustrated by the $152 million increase in
the fair value of long-term debt assuming a hypothetical
10 percent decrease in interest rates. However, our
sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding
increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio would
unfavorably affect our results and cash flows only if we would
elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its
fixed-rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value.

We manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing
financial derivative instruments. The primary objective of this
program is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing
the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio.
We have entered into several interest rate swap agreements,
designated as fair value hedges, which effectively resulted in
an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates
for obligations to pay floating rates. The following table
summarizes, by individual debt instrument, the interest rate
swap activity as of December 31, 2005:

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by
utilizing forward and option contracts, generally with terms of
365 days or less. The primary objective of this program is
to reduce our exposure to movements in the foreign currency
markets by locking in foreign currency rates. At
December 31, 2005, the following currency derivatives were
outstanding. All contracts currently qualify for hedge
accounting unless noted.

Steel arising from the Separation. That exposure is discussed in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Obligations
Associated with the Separation of United States Steel”.

Safe Harbor

These quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
include forward-looking statements with respect to
management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of
derivative instruments. These statements are based on certain
assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of
and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and
other feedstocks. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate,
future outcomes with respect to our hedging programs may differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking
statements.



Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION

Index to 2005 Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

F-1


Management’s
Responsibilities for Financial Statements

To the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Marathon
    Oil Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries
    (“Marathon”) are the responsibility of management and
    have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. They
    necessarily include some amounts that are based on best
    judgments and estimates. The financial information displayed in
    other sections of this Annual Report on
    Form

10-K

is
    consistent with these consolidated financial statements.

Marathon seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
    financial records by careful selection of its managers, by
    organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division
    of responsibility and by communications programs aimed at
    assuring that its policies and methods are understood throughout
    the organization.

The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role in the area of
    financial reporting and internal control over financial
    reporting through its Audit Committee. This Committee, composed
    solely of independent directors, regularly meets (jointly and
    separately) with the independent registered public accounting
    firm, management and internal auditors to monitor the proper
    discharge by each of their responsibilities relative to internal
    accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

To the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

Marathon’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(f) under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934). An evaluation of the design
    and effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting, based on the framework in

Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, was conducted under the supervision and the
    participation of management, including our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the results of
    this evaluation, Marathon’s management concluded that its
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2005. This evaluation did not include the
    internal control over financial reporting related to
    Marathon’s Libya operations acquired in a purchase business
    combination on December 29, 2005. Under the terms of the
    agreement, the operational re-entry date is January 1,
    2006; therefore, Marathon’s consolidated results of
    operations for 2005 do not include any results from the Libya
    operations. Total assets recorded for the Libya operations as of
    December 31, 2005 represent approximately 4 percent of
    total assets as of that date.

Marathon’s management assessment of the effectiveness of
    Marathon’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders of Marathon Oil Corporation:

We have completed integrated audits of Marathon Oil Corporation
    and its subsidiaries’ (Marathon) 2005 and 2004 consolidated
    financial statements and of its internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
    presented below.

Consolidated financial
    statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Marathon at December 31, 2005 and
    2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of Marathon’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
    audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
    financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
    audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements,
    Marathon changed its method of accounting for conditional asset
    retirement obligations in 2005 and its method of accounting for
    asset retirement obligations in 2003.

Internal control over financial
    reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
    over Financial Reporting, that Marathon maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. Marathon’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of Marathon’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has
    excluded Marathon’s Libya operations from its assessment of
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005 because it was acquired by Marathon in a
    purchase business combination in December 2005. We have also
    excluded the Libya operations from our audit of internal control
    over financial reporting. The Libya operations’ total
    assets and total revenues represent 4% and 0%, respectively, of
    the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
    for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements

1.  Summary of Principal Accounting Policies

Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon”) is engaged in
    worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural
    gas; domestic refining, marketing and transportation of crude
    oil and petroleum products; and worldwide marketing and
    transportation of natural gas and products manufactured from
    natural gas.

Principles applied in
    consolidation

– These consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the businesses
    comprising Marathon.

Prior to June 30, 2005, Marathon owned a 62 percent
    interest in Marathon Petroleum Company LLC (“MPC”).
    After Marathon acquired the remaining 38 percent interest
    as described in Note 5, MPC became a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Marathon. The accounts of MPC are consolidated in
    these financial statements for all periods presented and the
    applicable minority interest has been recognized for activity
    prior to the acquisition date.

Investments in variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for
    which Marathon is the primary beneficiary are consolidated.
    Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”),
    in which Marathon holds a 60% interest and was formed for the
    purpose of constructing and operating a liquefied natural gas
    (“LNG”) plant, is a VIE and Marathon is its primary
    beneficiary. As of December 31, 2005, total expenditures of
    $1.116 billion related to the LNG plant, including
    $1.066 billion of capital expenditures, have been incurred.

Investments in unincorporated oil and natural gas joint ventures
    and undivided interests in certain pipelines, natural gas
    processing plants and LNG tankers are consolidated on a pro rata
    basis.

Investments in entities over which Marathon has significant
    influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting and are carried at Marathon’s share of
    net assets plus loans and advances. This includes entities in
    which Marathon holds majority ownership but the minority
    shareholders have substantive participating rights in the
    investee. Differences in the basis of the investment and the
    separate net asset value of the investee, if any, are amortized
    into income over the remaining useful life of the underlying
    assets. Income from equity method investments represents
    Marathon’s proportionate share of income generated by the
    equity method investees.

Gains or losses from a change in ownership of a consolidated
    subsidiary or an unconsolidated investee are recognized in
    income in the period of change.

Use of estimates

– The preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
    statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the respective reporting periods.

Income per common share

– Basic net
    income per share is calculated based on the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per
    share assumes exercise of stock options and warrants and
    conversion of convertible debt and preferred securities,
    provided the effect is not antidilutive.

Segment information

– Marathon’s
    operations consist of three reportable operating segments:

•

Exploration and Production (“E&P”) –
    explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas on a
    worldwide basis;

•

Refining, Marketing and Transportation
    (“RM&T”) – refines, markets and
    transports crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the
    Midwest, the upper Great Plains and southeastern United States;
    and

•

Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and
    transports natural gas and products manufactured from natural
    gas, such as LNG and methanol, on a worldwide basis.

Management has determined that these are its operating segments
    because these are the components of Marathon (1) that
    engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and
    expenses are incurred, (2) whose operating results are
    regularly reviewed by Marathon’s chief operating decision
    maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to
    assess performance and (3) for which discrete financial
    information is available. The chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) is responsible for allocating resources to
    and assessing performance of Marathon’s operating segments.
    Information on assets by segment is not presented because it is
    not reviewed by the CODM. The CODM is the manager over the
    E&P and IG segments. In this role, the CODM is responsible
    for allocating resources within those segments, reviewing
    financial results of components within those segments, and
    assessing the performance of the components. The components
    within these segments that are separately reviewed and assessed
    by the CODM in his role as segment manager are aggregable
    because they have similar economic characteristics. The segment
    manager of the RM&T segment reports to the CODM. The
    RM&T segment manager is responsible for allocating resources
    within the segment, reviewing financial results of components
    within the segment, and assessing the performance of the
    components. The CODM reviews these financial results at the
    RM&T segment level.

F-8


Segment income represents income from operations allocable to
    operating segments. Marathon’s corporate general and
    administrative costs are not allocated to operating segments.
    These costs primarily consist of employment costs (including
    pension effects), professional services, facilities and other
    costs associated with corporate activities. These costs also
    include non-cash effects of stock-based compensation for all
    employees except those of MPC. Non-cash effects of stock-based
    compensation for MPC employees are allocated to the RM&T
    segment. Non-cash gains and losses on two long-term natural gas
    sales contracts in the United Kingdom accounted for as
    derivative instruments, gains and losses on ownership changes in
    subsidiaries and certain non-operating or infrequently occurring
    items (as determined by the CODM) also are not allocated to
    operating segments. See the reconciliation of segment income to
    consolidated income from operations in Note 8.

Revenue recognition

– Revenues are
    recognized when products are shipped or services are provided to
    customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Costs associated with
    revenues are recorded in cost of revenues.

Marathon recognizes revenues from the production of oil and
    natural gas when title is transferred. In the United States and
    certain international locations, production volumes of liquid
    hydrocarbons and natural gas are sold immediately and
    transported via pipeline. At other international locations,
    production volumes may be stored as inventory and sold at a
    later time. Royalties on the production of oil and natural gas
    are either paid in cash or settled through the delivery of
    volumes. Marathon includes royalties in its revenues and cost of
    revenues when settlement of the royalties is paid in cash, while
    royalties settled by the delivery of volumes are excluded from
    revenues and cost of revenues.

Rebates from vendors are recognized as a reduction to cost of
    revenues when the initiating transaction occurs. Incentives that
    are derived from contractual provisions are accrued based on
    past experience and recognized in cost of revenues.

Marathon follows the sales method of accounting for natural gas
    production imbalances and would recognize a liability if the
    existing proved reserves were not adequate to cover the current
    imbalance situation.

Matching buy/sell transactions

–
    Marathon considers matching buy/sell transactions to be
    arrangements in which Marathon agrees to buy a specific quantity
    and quality of crude oil or refined petroleum products to be
    delivered at a specific location while simultaneously agreeing
    to sell a specified quantity and quality of crude oil or refined
    petroleum products at a different location, usually with the
    same counterparty. All matching buy/sell transactions are
    settled in cash and are recorded in both revenues and cost of
    revenues as separate sales and purchase transactions, or on a
    “gross” basis. The commodity purchased and the
    commodity sold generally are similar in nature.

In a typical matching buy/sell transaction, Marathon enters into
    a contract to sell a particular grade of crude oil or refined
    product at a specified location and date to a particular
    counterparty, and simultaneously agrees to buy a particular
    grade of crude oil or refined product at a different location on
    the same or another specified date, typically from the same
    counterparty. The value of the purchased volumes rarely equals
    the sales value of the sold volumes. The value differences
    between purchases and sales are primarily due to (1) grade/
    quality differentials, (2) location differentials and/or
    (3) timing differences in those instances when the purchase
    and sale do not occur in the same month.

For the E&P segment, Marathon enters into matching buy/sell
    transactions to reposition crude oil from one market center to
    another to maximize the value received for Marathon’s crude
    oil production. For the RM&T segment, Marathon enters into
    crude oil matching buy/sell transactions to secure the most
    profitable refinery supply and enters into refined product
    matching buy/sell transactions to meet projected customer demand
    and to secure the required volumes in the most cost-effective
    manner.

The characteristics of Marathon’s matching buy/sell
    transactions include gross invoicing between Marathon and its
    counterparties and cash settlement of the transactions.
    Nonperformance by one party to deliver generally does not
    relieve the other party’s obligation to perform. Both
    transactions require physical delivery of the product. The risks
    and rewards of ownership are evidenced by title transfer,
    assumption of environmental risk, transportation scheduling,
    credit risk, counterparty nonperformance risk and the fact that
    Marathon has the primary obligation to perform.

Marathon will be required to change its accounting for purchases
    and sales of inventory with the same counterparty, including
    certain matching buy/sell transactions, in the second quarter of
    2006. See Note 30 for further information.

Cash and cash equivalents

– Cash and
    cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and
    investments in highly liquid debt instruments with maturities
    generally of three months or less.

Inventories

– Inventories are carried at
    lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories is determined
    primarily under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

An inventory market valuation reserve results when the recorded
    LIFO cost basis of crude oil and refined products inventories
    exceeds net realizable value. The reserve is decreased when
    market prices increase and

F-9


inventories turn over and is increased when market prices
    decrease. Changes in the inventory market valuation reserve
    result in non-cash charges or credits to costs and expenses.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
    accounts

– Marathon’s receivables
    primarily consist of customer accounts receivable, including
    proprietary credit card receivables. The allowance for doubtful
    accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit
    losses in Marathon’s proprietary credit card receivables.
    Marathon determines the allowance based on historical write-off
    experience and the volume of proprietary credit card sales.
    Marathon reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly
    and past-due balances over 180 days are reviewed
    individually for collectibility. All other customer receivables
    are recorded at the invoiced amounts and generally do not bear
    interest. Account balances for these customer receivables are
    charged directly to bad debt expense when it becomes probable
    the receivable will not be collected.

Traditional derivative instruments

–
    Marathon uses derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity
    price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
    Management has authorized the use of futures, forwards, swaps
    and combinations of options, including written or net written
    options, related to the purchase, production or sale of crude
    oil, natural gas and refined products, the fair value of certain
    assets and liabilities, future interest expense and certain
    business transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Changes
    in the fair values of all derivatives are recognized immediately
    in income, in revenues, other income, cost of revenues or net
    interest and other financing costs, unless the derivative
    qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows or certain foreign
    currency exposures. Cash flows related to derivatives used to
    manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk, as well as
    foreign currency exchange rate risk related to operating
    expenditures, are classified in operating activities with the
    underlying hedged transactions. Cash flows related to
    derivatives used to manage exchange rate risk related to capital
    expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are classified in
    investing activities with the underlying hedged transactions.

For derivatives qualifying as hedges of future cash flows or
    certain foreign currency exposures, the effective portion of any
    changes in fair value is recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity,
    and is reclassified to income – in revenues, cost of
    revenues, depreciation, depletion and amortization or net
    interest and other financing costs – when the
    underlying forecasted transaction is recognized in income. Any
    ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in income as it
    occurs. For discontinued cash flow hedges, prospective changes
    in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in income.
    Any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    the time a hedge is discontinued continues to be deferred until
    the original forecasted transaction occurs. However, if it is
    determined that the likelihood of the original forecasted
    transaction occurring is no longer probable, the entire related
    gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is
    immediately reclassified into income.

For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of
    recognized assets, liabilities or firm commitments, changes in
    the fair values of both the hedged item and the related
    derivative are recognized immediately in income – in
    revenues, cost of revenues or net interest and other financing
    costs – with an offsetting effect included in the
    basis of the hedged item. The net effect is to report in income
    the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving
    offsetting changes in fair value.

As market conditions change, Marathon may use selective
    derivative instruments that assume market risk. For derivative
    instruments that are classified as trading, changes in the fair
    value are recognized immediately in other income. Any premium
    received is amortized into income based on the underlying
    settlement terms of the derivative position. All related effects
    of a trading strategy, including physical settlement of the
    derivative position, are recognized in other income.

Nontraditional derivative instruments

–
    Certain contracts involving the purchase or sale of commodities
    are not considered normal purchases or normal sales under
    generally accepted accounting principles and are required to be
    accounted for as derivative instruments. Marathon refers to such
    contracts as “nontraditional derivative instruments”
    because, unlike traditional derivative instruments,
    nontraditional derivative instruments have not been entered into
    to manage a risk exposure. Such contracts are recorded in the
    balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair values are
    recognized in income as revenues or cost of revenues.

In the E&P segment, two long-term natural gas delivery
    commitment contracts in the United Kingdom are classified as
    nontraditional derivative instruments. These contracts contain
    pricing provisions that are not clearly and closely related to
    the underlying commodity and therefore must be accounted for as
    derivative instruments.

In the RM&T segment, certain physical commodity contracts
    are classified as nontraditional derivative instruments because
    certain volumes under these contracts are physically netted at
    particular delivery locations. The netting process causes all
    contracts at that delivery location to be considered derivative
    instruments. Other physical contracts that involve flash title
    are also accounted for as nontraditional derivative instruments
    as Marathon has not elected to treat these contracts as normal
    purchases or normal sales.

Property, plant and equipment

– Marathon
    uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas
    producing activities. Costs to acquire mineral interests in oil
    and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells
    that find proved reserves, and to drill and equip development
    wells are capitalized. Costs to drill

F-10


exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological
    and geophysical costs, and costs of carrying and retaining
    unproved properties are expensed. Costs incurred for exploratory
    wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved
    are capitalized if (1) the well has found a sufficient
    quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing
    well and (2) Marathon is making sufficient progress
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. The status of suspended well costs is monitored
    continuously and reviewed not less than quarterly.

Capitalized costs of producing oil and natural gas properties
    are depreciated and depleted by the units-of-production method.
    Support equipment and other property, plant and equipment are
    depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful
    lives.

Marathon evaluates its oil and gas producing properties for
    impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain
    instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant
    shared infrastructure. Impairment of proved properties is
    required when carrying value exceeds undiscounted future net
    cash flows based on total proved and risk-adjusted probable and
    possible reserves. Oil and gas producing properties deemed to be
    impaired are written down to their fair value, as determined by
    discounted future net cash flows based on total proved and
    risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves or, if available,
    comparable market values.

Marathon evaluates its unproved property investment and impairs
    based on time or geologic factors in addition to the use of an
    undiscounted future net cash flow approach. Information such as
    drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation
    or future plans to develop acreage are also considered. Unproved
    property investments deemed to be impaired are written down to
    their fair value, as determined by discounted future net cash
    flows. Impairment expense for unproved oil and natural gas
    properties is reported in exploration expenses.

Property, plant and equipment unrelated to oil and gas producing
    activities is recorded at cost and depreciated on the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, which range from 3 to 42 years. Such assets are
    reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less
    than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
    recognized based on the fair value of the asset.

When property, plant and equipment depreciated on an individual
    basis are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are
    reported in income. Gains on disposal of property, plant and
    equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the
    time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses
    are recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale.
    Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment
    depreciated on a group basis are credited to accumulated
    depreciation, depletion and amortization with no immediate
    effect on income.

F-11


are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure
    and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably
    fixed and determinable. If recoveries of remediation costs from
    third parties are probable, a receivable is recorded and is
    discounted when the estimated amount is reasonably fixed and
    determinable.

Asset retirement obligations

– The fair
    values of asset retirement obligations are recognized in the
    period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of
    fair value can be made. For Marathon, asset retirement
    obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas
    producing facilities. Asset retirement obligations for such
    facilities include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of
    production platforms, gathering systems, wells and related
    structures and restoration costs of land and seabed, including
    those leased. Estimates of these costs are developed for each
    property based on the type of production structure, depth of
    water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market
    demand for equipment, currently available procedures and
    consultations with construction and engineering professionals.
    Asset retirement obligations have not been recognized for
    certain of Marathon’s international oil and gas producing
    facilities as Marathon currently does not have a legal
    obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities.

Asset retirement obligations have not been recognized for the
    removal of materials and equipment from or the closure of
    certain refinery, pipeline and marketing assets because the fair
    value cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminate
    settlement date of the obligation. Upon adoption of Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations – an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 143,” on December 31, 2005,
    conditional asset retirement obligations for removal and
    disposal of fire-retardant material from certain refining
    facilities were recognized based on the most probable current
    cost projections. See Note 2 for further information
    regarding Marathon’s adoption of FIN No. 47.

Current inflation rates and credit-adjusted-risk-free interest
    rates are used to estimate the fair values of asset retirement
    obligations. Depreciation of capitalized asset retirement costs
    and accretion of asset retirement obligations are recorded over
    time. The depreciation will generally be determined on a
    units-of-production basis for production facilities and on a
    straight-line basis for refining facilities, while the accretion
    to be recognized will escalate over the lives of the assets.

Deferred taxes

– Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
    consequences attributable to differences between the financial
    statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    tax bases as reported in Marathon’s filings with the
    respective taxing authorities. The realization of deferred tax
    assets is assessed periodically based on several interrelated
    factors. These factors include Marathon’s expectation to
    generate sufficient future taxable income including future
    foreign source income, tax credits, operating loss
    carryforwards, and management’s intent regarding the
    permanent reinvestment of the income from certain foreign
    subsidiaries.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits

– Marathon has noncontributory
    defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all
    domestic employees as well as international employees located in
    Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. In addition, several
    excess benefits plans exist covering domestic employees within
    defined regulatory compensation limits. Benefits under these
    plans are based primarily on years of service and final average
    pensionable earnings. The benefits provided include both pension
    and health care.

Marathon also has defined benefit plans for other postretirement
    benefits covering most employees. Health care benefits are
    provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical and major
    medical benefit provisions subject to various cost sharing
    features. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain
    nonunion and union represented retiree beneficiaries. Other
    postretirement benefits have not been funded in advance.

Marathon uses a December 31 measurement date for its
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Stock-based compensation

– The Marathon
    Oil Corporation 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan (the
    “Plan”) authorizes the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors of Marathon to grant stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, stock awards, cash awards and performance
    awards to employees. The Plan also allows Marathon to provide
    equity compensation to its non-employee directors. No more than
    20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the Plan,
    and no more than 8,500,000 of those shares may be used for
    awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights.
    Shares subject to awards that are forfeited, terminated, expire
    unexercised, settled in cash, exchanged for other awards,
    tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, withheld to
    satisfy tax obligations or otherwise lapse become available for
    future grants.

The Plan replaced the 1990 Stock Plan, the Non-Officer
    Restricted Stock Plan, the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, the
    deferred stock benefit provision of the Deferred Compensation
    Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Senior Executive Officer
    Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, and the Annual Incentive
    Compensation Plan (collectively, the “Prior Plans”).
    No new grants will be made from the Prior Plans. Any awards
    previously granted under the Prior Plans shall continue to vest
    and/or be exercisable in accordance with their original terms
    and conditions.

Marathon’s stock options represent the right to purchase
    shares of common stock at the fair market value of the common
    stock on the date of grant. Prior to 2004, certain options were
    granted with a tandem stock appreciation right, which allows the
    recipient to instead elect to receive cash and/or common stock
    equal to the excess of the fair

F-12


market value of shares of common stock, as determined in
    accordance with the Plan, over the option price of the shares.
    Most stock options granted under the Plan vest ratably over a
    three-year period and all expire ten years from the date they
    are granted.

Similar to stock options, stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”) represent the right to receive a payment
    equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of common
    stock on the date the right is exercised over the exercise
    price. In general, SARs that have been granted under the Plan
    are settled in shares of stock, vest ratably over a three-year
    period and have a maximum term of ten years from the date they
    are granted.

In 2003 and 2004, the Compensation Committee granted stock-based
    Performance Awards to Marathon’s officers under the Plan.
    The stock-based Performance Awards represent shares of common
    stock that are subject to forfeiture provisions and restrictions
    on transfer. Those restrictions may be removed if certain
    pre-established performance measures are met. The stock-based
    Performance Awards granted under the Plan generally vest at the
    end of a 36-month performance period if certain pre-established
    performance targets are achieved and the recipient remains
    employed by Marathon at that date.

In 2005, the Compensation Committee granted cash-based
    Performance Awards to Marathon’s and MPC’s officers
    under the Plan. The cash-based performance units generally vest
    at the end of a 36-month performance period if certain
    pre-established performance targets are achieved and the
    recipient remains employed by Marathon at that date. The target
    value of each performance unit granted is $1, with the actual
    payout varying from zero percent to 200 percent of the
    target value based on actual performance achieved. The
    Compensation Committee also granted time-based restricted stock
    to the officers under the Plan in 2005. The restricted stock
    awards vest three years from the date of grant, contingent on
    the recipient’s continued employment. Prior to vesting, the
    restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock
    and receive dividends thereon. The nonvested shares are not
    transferable and are retained by Marathon until they vest.

Marathon also grants restricted stock to certain non-officer
    employees under the Plan based on their performance within
    certain guidelines and for retention purposes. The restricted
    stock awards generally vest in one-third increments over a
    three-year period, contingent on the recipient’s continued
    employment. Prior to vesting, the restricted stock recipients
    have the right to vote such stock and receive dividends thereon.
    The nonvested shares are not transferable and are retained by
    Marathon until they vest.

Unearned compensation is charged to stockholders’ equity
    when restricted stock and performance shares are granted.
    Compensation expense is recognized over the balance of the
    vesting period and is adjusted if conditions of the restricted
    stock or performance share grant are not met. Cash-based
    performance units are classified as a liability and compensation
    expense is recognized over the 36-month performance period based
    on expected payout.

Marathon maintains an equity compensation program for its
    non-employee directors under the Plan. Pursuant to the program,
    non-employee directors must defer 50 percent of their
    annual retainers in the form of common stock units. In addition,
    each non-employee director receives an annual grant of
    non-retainer common stock units under the Plan. In 2005, the
    value of each grant was $60,000. The program also provides each
    non-employee director with a matching grant of up to 1,000
    shares of common stock on his or her initial election to the
    Board if he or she purchases an equivalent number of shares
    within 60 days of joining the Board.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon has applied the fair
    value based method of accounting to all grants and any modified
    grants of stock-based compensation. All prior outstanding and
    unvested awards continue to be accounted for under the intrinsic
    value method. The following net income and per share data
    illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if
    the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and
    unvested awards in each period.

F-13


Marathon records compensation cost over the stated vesting
    period for stock options that are subject to specific vesting
    conditions and specify (1) that an employee vests in the
    award upon becoming “retirement eligible” or
    (2) that the employee will continue to vest in the award
    after retirement without providing any additional service. Upon
    adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 123 (Revised 2004),
    “Share-Based Payment,” such compensation cost will be
    recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
    employees or over the period from the grant date to the
    retirement eligibility date if retirement eligibility will be
    reached during the stated vesting period. The compensation cost
    determined under these two approaches did not differ materially
    for the periods presented above.

The above pro forma amounts were based on a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, which included the following information

Concentrations of credit risk

– Marathon
    is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by
    counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated
    in energy related industries. The creditworthiness of customers
    and other counterparties is subject to continuing review,
    including the use of master netting agreements, where
    appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than
    10 percent of annual revenues, Marathon has significant
    exposures to United States Steel arising from the Separation.
    These exposures are discussed in Note 3.

Reclassifications

– Certain
    reclassifications of prior years’ data have been made to
    conform to 2005 classifications.

2.  New Accounting Standards

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN No. 47, “Accounting
    for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations – an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” This
    interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize
    a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement
    activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event
    if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated.
    If the liability’s fair value cannot be reasonably
    estimated, then the entity must disclose (1) a description
    of the obligation, (2) the fact that a liability has not
    been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably
    estimated, and (3) the reasons why the fair value cannot be
    reasonably estimated. FIN No. 47 also clarifies when an
    entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate
    the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. Marathon
    adopted FIN No. 47 as of December 31, 2005. A charge
    of $19 million, net of taxes of $12 million, related
    to adopting FIN No. 47 was recognized as a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle in 2005. At the time
    of adoption, total assets increased $22 million and total
    liabilities increased $41 million.

The pro forma net income and net income per share effect as if
    FIN No. 47 had been applied during 2005, 2004 and 2003 is
    not significantly different than amounts reported. The following
    summarizes the total amount of the liability for asset
    retirement obligations as if FIN No. 47 had been applied
    during all periods presented. The pro forma impact of the
    adoption of FIN No. 47 on these unaudited pro forma
    liability amounts has been measured using the information,
    assumptions and interest rates used to measure the obligation
    recognized upon adoption of FIN No. 47.

December 31, 2005


In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
    “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment
    of APB Opinion No. 29.” This amendment eliminates the
    Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 29 exception for fair value recognition of nonmonetary
    exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an
    exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
    commercial substance. Marathon adopted SFAS No. 153 on a
    prospective basis as of July 1, 2005.

Effective January 1, 2005, Marathon adopted FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 19-1, “Accounting
    for Suspended Well Costs,” which amended the guidance for
    suspended exploratory well costs in SFAS No. 19,
    “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
    Producing Companies.” SFAS No. 19 requires costs of
    drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending
    determination of whether the well has found proved reserves.
    When a

F-14


classification of proved reserves cannot yet be made, FSP
    No. FAS 19-1 allows exploratory well costs to continue to
    be capitalized when (1) the well has found a sufficient
    quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well
    and (2) the enterprise is making sufficient progress
    assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability
    of the project. Marathon’s accounting policy for suspended
    exploratory well costs was in accordance with FSP No. FAS
    19-1 prior to its adoption. FSP No. FAS 19-1 also requires
    certain disclosures to be made regarding capitalized exploratory
    well costs which are included in Note 14.

Effective December 21, 2004, Marathon adopted FSP
    No. FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement
    No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

to the Tax
    Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.” FSP No. FAS 109-1
    states the deduction, signed into law on October 22, 2004,
    of up to 9 percent (when fully phased-in) of the lesser of
    (1) “qualified production activities income,” as
    defined in the Act, or (2) taxable income (after the
    deduction for the utilization of any net operating loss
    carryforwards) should be accounted for as a special deduction in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, Marathon treats
    qualified production activities income as a special deduction in
    the years taken.

Effective July 1, 2004, Marathon adopted FSP No. FAS
    106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
    the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
    Act of 2003.” FSP No. FAS 106-2 includes guidance on
    recognizing the effects of the new legislation under the various
    conditions surrounding the assessment of “actuarial
    equivalence.” Marathon has determined, based on available
    regulatory guidance, that the postretirement plans’
    prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the
    Medicare “Part D” benefit under the Act. The
    subsidy-related reduction at July 1, 2004 in the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the Marathon
    postretirement plans was $93 million. The combined
    favorable pretax effect of the subsidy-related reduction for
    2004 on the measurement of the net periodic postretirement
    benefit cost related to service cost, interest cost and
    actuarial gain amortization was $7 million.

Effective July 1, 2004, Marathon adopted FSP No. FAS
    142-2, “Application of FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

to Oil- and
    Gas-Producing Entities.” FSP No. FAS 142-2 states
    drilling and mineral rights of oil- and gas-producing entities
    are excluded from SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” and accordingly, should not be
    classified as intangible assets rather than oil and gas
    properties. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 142-2 did not have
    an effect on Marathon’s consolidated financial position,
    cash flows or results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the provisions
    of SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
    No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
    and Technical Corrections,” relating to the classification
    of the effects of early extinguishment of debt in the
    consolidated statement of income. As a result, losses from the
    early extinguishment of debt, which were previously reported as
    an extraordinary item, will be included in income from
    continuing operations before income taxes.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 148,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
    Transition and Disclosure,” an amendment of SFAS
    No. 123, provides alternative methods for the transition of
    accounting for stock-based compensation from the intrinsic value
    method to the fair value method. Marathon has applied the fair
    value method to grants made, modified or settled on or after
    January 1, 2003.

Effective January 1, 2003, Marathon adopted SFAS
    No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations.” The transition adjustment related to adopting
    SFAS No. 143, was recognized as a cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect on net
    income of adopting SFAS No. 143 was a net favorable effect
    of $4 million, net of tax of $4 million. At the time
    of adoption, total assets increased $120 million, and total
    liabilities increased $116 million.

3.  Information about United States Steel

The Separation

– Prior to
    December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of
    common stock: USX – Marathon Group common stock, which
    was intended to reflect the performance of Marathon’s
    energy business, and USX – U.S. Steel Group
    common stock (“Steel Stock”), which was intended to
    reflect the performance of Marathon’s steel business. On
    December 31, 2001, in a tax-free distribution to holders of
    Steel Stock, Marathon exchanged the common stock of United
    States Steel for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a
    one-for-one basis (“the Separation”).

In connection with the Separation, Marathon and United States
    Steel entered into a number of agreements, including:

Financial Matters Agreement

– Marathon
    and United States Steel have entered into a Financial Matters
    Agreement that provides for United States Steel’s
    assumption of certain industrial revenue bonds and certain other
    financial obligations of Marathon. The Financial Matters
    Agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary
    of the Separation, United States Steel will provide for
    Marathon’s discharge from any remaining liability under any
    of the assumed industrial revenue bonds.

Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States Steel has
    all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed
    from Marathon, including all rights related to purchase options,
    prepayments or the grant or

F-15


release of security interests. However, United States Steel has
    no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of
    any of the assumed leases, other than extensions set forth in
    the terms of any of the assumed leases.

United States Steel is the sole general partner of Clairton
    1314B Partnership, L.P., which owns certain cokemaking
    facilities formerly owned by United States Steel. Marathon has
    guaranteed to the limited partners all obligations of United
    States Steel under the partnership documents. The Financial
    Matters Agreement requires United States Steel to use
    commercially reasonable efforts to have Marathon released from
    its obligations under this guarantee. United States Steel may
    dissolve the partnership under certain circumstances, including
    if it is required to fund accumulated cash shortfalls of the
    partnership in excess of $150 million. In addition to the
    normal commitments of a general partner, United States Steel has
    indemnified the limited partners for certain income tax
    exposures.

The Financial Matters Agreement requires Marathon to use
    commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all
    covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a
    default or the acceleration of payments on the assumed
    obligations.

United States Steel’s obligations to Marathon under the
    Financial Matters Agreement are general unsecured obligations
    that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable
    and other general unsecured obligations. The Financial Matters
    Agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United
    States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages
    on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer
    assets without Marathon’s consent.

Tax Sharing Agreement

– Marathon and
    United States Steel have entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement
    that reflects each party’s rights and obligations relating
    to payments and refunds of income, sales, transfer and other
    taxes that are attributable to periods beginning prior to and
    including the Separation Date and taxes resulting from
    transactions effected in connection with the Separation.

The Tax Sharing Agreement incorporates the general tax sharing
    principles of the former tax allocation policy. In general,
    Marathon and United States Steel will make payments between them
    such that, with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary
    tax returns for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on
    or before the Separation Date, the amount of taxes to be paid by
    each of Marathon and United States Steel will be determined,
    subject to certain adjustments, as if the former groups each
    filed their own consolidated, combined or unitary tax return.
    The Tax Sharing Agreement also provides for payments between
    Marathon and United States Steel for certain tax adjustments
    that may be made after the Separation. Other provisions address,
    but are not limited to, the handling of tax audits, settlements
    and return filing in cases where both Marathon and United States
    Steel have an interest in the results of these activities.

In 2005, 2004 and 2003, in accordance with the terms of the tax
    sharing agreement, Marathon paid $6 million,
    $3 million and $16 million to United States Steel in
    connection with the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service
    of the consolidated federal income tax returns of USX
    Corporation for the years 1992 through 1997. Included in
    discontinued operations in 2003 is an $8 million adjustment
    to the liabilities to United States Steel under this tax sharing
    agreement.

Relationship between Marathon and United States Steel
    after the Separation

– As a result of the
    Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate
    companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other.
    As of December 31, 2005, Thomas J. Usher was the
    non-executive chairman of the board of both companies and four
    of the ten remaining members of Marathon’s board of
    directors are also directors of United States Steel.
    Mr. Usher retired as chairman of United States Steel on
    January 31, 2006. At that date, he and one other Marathon
    board member left United States Steel’s board of directors.

Sales to United States Steel in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
    $31 million, $30 million and $31 million,
    primarily for natural gas. Purchases from United States Steel in
    2005, 2004 and 2003 were $39 million, $27 million and
    $14 million, primarily for raw materials. Management
    believes that transactions with United States Steel were
    conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated
    parties. Marathon reimbursed United States Steel $1 million
    and $3 million, respectively, in 2005 and 2004, for the
    payment of benefits to retirees, including Mr. Usher, under
    United States Steel’s 2001 plan of reorganization.

Amounts receivable from or payable to United States Steel
    arising from the Separation

– As previously
    discussed, Marathon remains primarily obligated for certain
    financings for which United States Steel has assumed
    responsibility for repayment under the terms of the Separation.
    When United States Steel makes payments on the principal of
    these financings, both the receivable from United States Steel
    and the obligation are reduced.

5.  Acquisitions

Minority Interest in
    MPC

On June 30, 2005, Marathon acquired the 38 percent
    ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC
    (“MAP”) previously held by Ashland. In addition,
    Marathon acquired a portion of Ashland’s Valvoline Instant
    Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest
    in LOOP LLC, which owns and operates the only
    U.S. deepwater oil port, and its interest in LOCAP LLC,
    which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions
    (the “Acquisition”), MAP is now wholly owned by
    Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company
    LLC (“MPC”) effective September 1, 2005. The
    Acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting and, as such, Marathon’s results of operations
    include the results of the acquired businesses from
    June 30, 2005. The total consideration, including debt
    assumed, is as follows:

(a)

The MAP Limited Liability Company Agreement was amended to
    eliminate the requirement for MPC to make quarterly cash
    distributions to Marathon and Ashland between the date the
    principal transaction agreements were signed and the closing of
    the Acquisition. Cash and MPC accounts receivable above include
    $506 million representing Ashland’s 38 percent of
    MPC’s distributable cash as of June 30, 2005.

(b)

Ashland shareholders received 17.539 million shares valued
    at $54.45 per share, which was Marathon’s average common
    stock price over the trading days between June 23 and
    June 29, 2005. The exchange ratio was designed to provide
    an aggregate number of Marathon shares worth $915 million
    based on Marathon’s average common stock price for each of
    the 20 consecutive trading days ending with the third complete
    trading day prior to June 30, 2005.

(c)

Assumed debt was repaid on July 1, 2005.

(d)

Marathon is entitled to the tax deductions for Ashland’s
    future payments of certain contingent liabilities related to
    businesses previously owned by Ashland. However, pursuant to the
    terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, Marathon has agreed to
    reimburse Ashland for a portion of these future payments. This
    contingent consideration will be included in the purchase price
    as such payments are made to Ashland.

F-18


The primary reasons for the Acquisition and the principal
    factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in
    the recognition of goodwill are:

•

Marathon believes the outlook for the refining and marketing
    business is attractive in MPC’s core areas of operation.
    Complete ownership of MPC provides Marathon the opportunity to
    leverage MPC’s access to premium U.S. markets where
    Marathon expects the levels of demand to remain high for the
    foreseeable future;

•

The Acquisition increases Marathon’s participation in the
    RM&T business without the risks commonly associated with
    integrating a newly acquired business;

•

MPC provides Marathon with an increased source of cash flow
    which Marathon believes enhances the geographical balance in its
    overall risk portfolio;

•

Marathon anticipates the transaction will be accretive to income
    per share;

•

The Acquisition eliminated the timing and valuation
    uncertainties associated with the exercise of the Put/Call,
    Registration Rights and Standstill Agreement entered into with
    the formation of MPC in 1998, as well as the associated premium
    and discount; and

•

The Acquisition eliminated the possibility that a misalignment
    of Ashland’s and Marathon’s interests, as co-owners of
    MPC, could adversely affect MPC’s future growth and
    financial performance.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 30, 2005.

The goodwill arising from the purchase price allocation was
    $735 million, which was assigned to the RM&T segment.
    None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Of the
    $112 million allocated to intangible assets,
    $49 million was allocated to retail marketing tradenames
    with indefinite lives.

The purchase price allocated to equity method investments is
    $230 million higher than the underlying net assets of the
    investees. This excess will be amortized over the expected
    useful life of the underlying assets except for
    $144 million of the excess related to goodwill.

Libya Re-entry

On December 29, 2005, Marathon, in conjunction with its
    partners in the former Oasis Group, entered into an agreement
    with the National Oil Corporation of Libya to return to its oil
    and natural gas exploration and production operations in the
    Waha concessions in Libya. Marathon holds a 16.33 percent
    interest in the Waha concessions and was required to cease
    operations there in 1986 to comply with U.S. government
    sanctions. Over time, Marathon had written off all its assets in
    Libya. The re-entry terms include a 25-year extension of the
    concessions to 2030 through 2034 and a payment of
    $520 million from Marathon, which was made in January 2006.
    An additional payment estimated to be approximately
    $212 million is payable by Marathon within one year of the
    agreement date.

The primary reasons for the transaction and the principal
    factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in
    the recognition of goodwill include the fact that the re-entry
    allows Marathon to expand its exploration and production
    operations without many of the risks commonly associated with
    integrating a newly acquired

F-19


business including having a trained workforce in place that has
    maintained operations and added to the hydrocarbon resource
    during the absence of Marathon and its partners. The transaction
    also could assist Marathon in identifying and participating in
    potential future projects in Libya.

The operational re-entry date under the terms of the agreement
    is January 1, 2006; therefore, Marathon’s consolidated
    results of operations for 2005 do not include any results from
    the operations of the Waha concessions. The transaction was
    accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 29,
    2005. Marathon is in the process of finalizing the fair value
    estimates for certain assets and liabilities; thus the
    allocation of the purchase price is preliminary.

The goodwill arising from the preliminary purchase price
    allocation was $315 million, which was assigned to the
    E&P segment. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax
    purposes.

The following unaudited pro forma data is as if the Acquisition
    and the re-entry to the Libya concessions had been consummated
    at the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma data is
    based on historical information and does not reflect the actual
    results that would have occurred nor is it indicative of future
    results of operations.

Khanty Mansiysk Oil Corporation

On May 12, 2003, Marathon acquired Khanty Mansiysk Oil
    Corporation (“KMOC”) for $285 million, including
    the assumption of $31 million in debt. KMOC is engaged in
    evaluating or developing nine oil fields in the Khanty-Mansiysk
    region of western Siberia in the Russian Federation. Results of
    operations for 2003 include the results of KMOC from
    May 12, 2003.

The following unaudited pro forma data for Marathon includes the
    results of operations of KMOC giving effect to the acquisition
    as if it had been consummated at the beginning of the period
    presented. The pro forma data is based on historical information
    and does not necessarily represent the actual results that would
    have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results
    of operations.

6.  Discontinued Operations

On October 1, 2003, Marathon sold its exploration and
    production operations in western Canada for $612 million.
    This divestiture decision was made as part of Marathon’s
    strategic plan to rationalize noncore oil and gas properties.
    The results of these operations have been reported separately as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income. The sale resulted in a gain of $278 million,
    including a tax benefit of $8 million, which has been
    reported in discontinued operations. Revenues applicable to the
    discontinued operations totaled $188 million for 2003.
    Pretax income from discontinued operations was $66 million
    for 2003. During 2004, the final working capital adjustment was
    determined, which resulted in an additional gain of
    $4 million that is reported in discontinued operations.

A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate
    (35 percent) applied to income before income taxes to the
    total provisions for income taxes follows:

(a)

See Note 2 regarding Marathon’s adoption of FSP
    No. FAS 109-1. Marathon has treated the deduction, equal to
    3 percent of qualified production activities income for
    2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as a special
    deduction.

F-24


Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from the following:

(a)

For 2005, includes $547 million for Norway and
    $54 million for Angola, both of which have no expiration
    dates. The remainder expire 2006 through 2019.

(b)

Valuation allowances related to federal deferred tax assets are
    associated with capital loss carryforwards. The remaining
    valuation allowances are primarily associated with net operating
    loss carryforwards in several state jurisdictions, Norway,
    Angola and several other foreign jurisdictions.

(c)

Marathon expects to generate sufficient future taxable income to
    realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets. In addition, the
    ability to realize the benefit of foreign tax credits is based
    on certain assumptions concerning future operating conditions
    (particularly as related to prevailing oil prices), income
    generated from foreign sources and Marathon’s tax profile
    in the years that such credits may be claimed.

Net deferred tax liabilities were classified in the consolidated

Marathon is continuously undergoing examination of its federal
    income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”). Marathon and the IRS have settled tax years
    through 1997 and Marathon is in appeals for tax years 1998
    through 2001. Audits for the tax years 2002 and 2003 are in
    progress and audits for tax years 2004 and 2005 will commence in
    2006. Marathon believes it has made adequate provision for
    federal income taxes and interest which may become payable for
    years not yet settled. Further, the Company is routinely
    involved in state and local income tax audits, and on occasion,
    foreign jurisdiction tax audits. Marathon believes all other
    audits will be resolved within the amounts paid and/or provided
    for these liabilities.

Pretax income from continuing operations included amounts
    attributable to foreign sources of $1.127 billion in 2005,
    $534 million in 2004 and $453 million in 2003.

Undistributed income of certain consolidated foreign
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 amounted to
    $1.544 billion for which no deferred U.S. income tax
    provision has been made because Marathon intends to permanently
    reinvest such income in those foreign operations. If such income
    was not permanently reinvested, a deferred tax liability of
    $541 million would have been required.

See Note 3 for a discussion of the Tax Sharing Agreement
    between Marathon and United States Steel.

F-25


11. Business Transformation

During 2003, Marathon implemented an organizational realignment
    plan that included streamlining Marathon’s business
    processes and services, realigning reporting relationships to
    reduce costs across all organizations, consolidating
    organizations in Houston, Texas and reducing the workforce.
    During 2004, Marathon entered into two outsourcing agreements to
    achieve further business process improvements and cost
    reductions.

During 2004 and 2003, Marathon recorded $43 million and
    $24 million of costs as general and administrative expenses
    related to these business transformation programs. These charges
    included employee severance and benefit costs related to the
    elimination of approximately 700 regular employee positions,
    relocation costs, net benefit plans settlement and curtailment
    losses and fixed asset related costs.

There were minimal charges to expense during 2005 and, as of
    December 31, 2005, no accrual remained related to the
    business transformation programs. The following table sets forth
    the significant components and activity in the business
    transformation programs during 2004 and 2003.

    costs were estimated to exceed the LIFO inventory values at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 by approximately
    $1,535 million and $1,294 million. Cost of revenues
    and income from operations showed no change in 2005 as a result
    of liquidations of LIFO inventories. Cost of revenues was
    reduced and income from operations was increased by
    $4 million in 2004, and $11 million in 2003 as a
    result of liquidations of LIFO inventories.

F-26


13. Investments and Long-Term Receivables

Summarized financial information of investees accounted for by
    the equity method of accounting follows:

Marathon’s carrying value of its equity method investments
    is $643 million higher than the underlying net assets of
    investees. This basis difference is being amortized into income
    over the remaining useful lives of the underlying net assets
    except for $144 million of the excess related to goodwill.

Dividends and partnership distributions received from equity
    method investees (excluding distributions that represented a
    return of capital previously contributed) were $200 million
    in 2005, $152 million in 2004, and $175 million in
    2003.

On June 30, 2003, Marathon and Kinder Morgan Energy
    Partners, L.P. (“Kinder Morgan”) dissolved MKM
    Partners L.P. which had oil and gas production operations in the
    Permian Basin of Texas. Marathon held an 85 percent
    noncontrolling interest in the partnership. Prior to the
    dissolution of the partnership, Kinder Morgan acquired MKM
    Partners L.P.’s 12.75 percent interest in the SACROC
    unit for an undisclosed amount. The partnership recorded a loss
    on the disposal of SACROC of $19 million, of which
    Marathon’s share was $17 million. Also prior to the
    dissolution, Marathon recorded a $107 million impairment of
    its investment in MKM Partners L.P. due to an
    other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the
    investment. The total loss recognized by Marathon related to the
    dissolution of MKM Partners L.P. was $124 million. The
    partnership’s interest in the Yates field was distributed
    to Marathon and Kinder Morgan on dissolution.

14. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment includes gross assets acquired
    under capital leases of $78 million and $49 million at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, with related amounts in
    accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization of
    $6 million and $6 million at December 31, 2005
    and 2004.

    $43 million for the Ozona prospect that was primarily
    incurred in 2001 and 2002 and $16 million for the Flathead
    prospect that was primarily incurred in 2001. Both prospects are
    located in the Gulf of Mexico. Marathon’s plans are to
    develop the Ozona prospect as a subsea tieback to area
    infrastructure. Commercial terms have been secured for the
    tieback and processing of Ozona production and Marathon is
    attempting to secure a drilling rig to drill the development
    well. Technical evaluations on the Flathead prospect continued
    during 2005 and are progressing towards a potential re-entry and
    sidetrack well before 2008. In 2005, a well drilled on a block
    directly offsetting the Flathead prospect encountered
    hydrocarbons.

17. Derivative Instruments

The following table sets forth quantitative information by
    category of derivative instrument at December 31, 2005 and
    2004. These amounts are reported on a gross basis by individual
    derivative instrument.

(a)

The fair value and carrying value of derivative instruments are
    the same. The fair values for OTC positions are determined using
    option-pricing models or dealer quotes. The fair values of
    exchange-traded positions are based on market quotes derived
    from major exchanges. The fair value of interest rate and
    foreign currency swaps is based on dealer quotes.
    Marathon’s consolidated balance sheet is reported on a net
    asset/(liability) basis by brokerage firm, as permitted by the
    master netting agreements.

(b)

There was no ineffectiveness associated with fair value hedges
    for 2005 or 2004 because the hedging instruments and the
    existing firm commitment contracts are priced on the same
    underlying index. Certain derivative instruments used in the
    fair value hedges mature between 2006 and 2008.

(c)

The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value for cash
    flow hedges, on a before tax basis, was less than
    $1 million during 2005 and $1 million during 2004. In
    addition, during 2004, losses of $3 million were recognized
    in revenues as the result of a discontinuation of a portion of a
    cash flow hedge related to natural gas and crude oil production.
    There were no losses recorded in 2005 relating to a
    discontinuation. Of the unrealized gains and losses recorded in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31,
    2005, a net gain of $2 million is expected to be
    reclassified to income in 2006.

(d)

The contract price under the U.K. long-term natural gas
    contracts is reset annually and is indexed to a basket of costs
    of living and energy commodity indices for the previous twelve
    months. The fair value of these contracts is determined by
    applying the difference between the contract price and the U.K.
    forward gas strip price to the expected sales volumes under
    these contracts for the next 18 months. The eighteen-month
    period represents approximately 90 percent of market
    liquidity in that region.

(e)

Certain physical commodity contracts are classified as
    nontraditional derivative instruments because certain volumes
    covered by these contracts are physically netted at particular
    delivery locations. Additionally, other physical contracts that
    involve flash title are accounted for as nontraditional
    derivative instruments.

(f)

The fair value of OTC interest rate swaps excludes accrued
    interest amounts not yet settled. As of December 31, 2005
    and 2004, accrued interest approximated $3 million and
    $4 million. The net fair value of the OTC interest rate
    swaps as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 is included in
    long-term debt. See Note 20.

F-30


18. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value of the financial instruments disclosed herein is not
    necessarily representative of the amount that could be realized
    or settled, nor does the fair value amount consider the tax
    consequences of realization or settlement. The following table
    summarizes financial instruments, excluding derivative financial
    instruments disclosed in Note 17, by individual balance
    sheet line item. Marathon’s financial instruments at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 were:

Fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets
    or liabilities approximates carrying value due to the short-term
    maturity of the instruments. Fair value of investments and
    long-term receivables was based on discounted cash flows or
    other specific instrument analysis. Fair value of long-term debt
    instruments was based on market prices where available or
    current borrowing rates available for financings with similar
    terms and maturities. Fair value of the receivables from United
    States Steel was estimated using market prices for United States
    Steel debt assuming the industrial revenue bonds are redeemed on
    or before the tenth anniversary of the Separation per the
    Financial Matters Agreement.

19. Short-Term Debt

Marathon has a commercial paper program that is supported by the
    unused and available credit on the Marathon five-year revolving
    credit facility discussed in Note 20. At December 31,
    2005, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.

Additionally, as part of the Acquisition on June 30, 2005
    discussed in Note 5, Marathon assumed $1.920 billion
    in debt which was repaid on July 1, 2005.

F-31


20. Long-Term Debt

(a)

Marathon has a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit
    agreement and MPC has a $500 million five-year revolving
    credit facility, both of which terminate in May 2009. These
    facilities each require a representation at an initial borrowing
    that there has been no change in the respective borrower’s
    consolidated financial position or operations, considered as a
    whole, that would materially and adversely affect such
    borrower’s ability to perform its obligations under its
    revolving credit facility. Interest on these facilities is based
    on defined short-term market rates. During the term of the
    agreements, Marathon is obligated to pay a variable facility fee
    on total commitments, which at December 31, 2005 was
    0.125%. At December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings
    against these facilities.

(b)

These notes contain a make-whole provision allowing Marathon the
    right to repay the debt at a premium to market price.

(c)

United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment of
    $428 million of these obligations.

(d)

This sale-leaseback financing arrangement relates to a lease of
    a slab caster at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works
    facility in Alabama with a term through 2012. Marathon is the
    primary obligor under this lease. Under the Financial Matters
    Agreement, United States Steel has assumed responsibility for
    all obligations under this lease. This lease is an amortizing
    financing with a final maturity of 2012, subject to additional
    extensions.

(e)

This obligation relates to a lease of equipment at United States
    Steel’s Clairton Works cokemaking facility in Pennsylvania
    with a term through 2012. Marathon is the primary obligor under
    this lease. Under the Financial Matters Agreement, United States
    Steel has assumed responsibility for all obligations under this
    lease. This lease is an amortizing financing with a final
    maturity of 2012.

(f)

Required payments of long-term debt for the years 2007-2010 are
    $317 million, $474 million, $417 million and
    $19 million, respectively. Of these amounts, payments
    assumed by United States Steel are $16 million,
    $24 million, $17 million and $19 million,
    respectively.

(g)

In the event of a change in control of Marathon, as defined in
    the related agreements, debt obligations totaling
    $1.573 billion at December 31, 2005, may be declared
    immediately due and payable.

(h)

See Note 17 for information on interest rate swaps.

21. MPC Receivables Purchase and Sale Facility

On July 1, 2005, MPC entered into a $200 million,
    three-year Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement with certain
    purchasers. The program was structured to allow MPC to
    periodically sell a participating interest in pools of eligible
    accounts receivable. If any receivables were sold under the
    facility, MPC would not guarantee the transferred receivables
    and would have no obligations upon default. During the term of
    the agreement MPC was obligated to pay a facility fee of 0.12%.
    Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the facility was
    terminated. No receivables were sold under the agreement during
    its term.

23. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Obligations
and Funded Status

The following summarizes the obligations and funded status for
    Marathon’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans:

(a)

Includes the impact of decreasing the retirement age assumption
    by two years and increasing the lump sum election rate
    assumption from 90 percent to 96 percent based on
    changing trends in Marathon’s experience, which increased
    the obligations by $109 million.

(b)

Includes the impact related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which reduced the
    obligation by $93 million.

(c)

Includes the addition of certain employees of the maleic
    anhydride business acquired as part of the Acquisition.

(d)

Excludes the effects of minority interest as of
    December 31, 2004 and income taxes.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit
    pension plans was $1.748 billion and $1.423 billion at
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other Benefits in
    the above table is not applicable to Marathon’s foreign
    subsidiaries as those subsidiaries do not sponsor any
    postretirement plans other than pension plans.

On June 30, 2005, as a result of the Acquisition,
    MPC’s pension and other postretirement benefit plan
    obligations were remeasured using current discount rates and
    plan assumptions. The discount rate was decreased to
    5.25 percent from 5.75 percent. As part of the
    application of the purchase method of accounting, MPC recognized
    38 percent of its unrecognized net transition gain, prior
    service costs and actuarial losses related to its pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans. As a result, obligations
    related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    increased by $264 million and $28 million.

Expected
Long-Term Return on Plan Assets

U.S.
Plans

Historical markets are studied and long-term historical
    relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved
    consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle
    that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return
    over the long term. Certain components of the asset mix are
    modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt
    returns and stock yields. Our assumptions are compared to those
    of peer companies and historical returns for reasonableness and
    appropriateness.

International
Plans

The overall expected long-term return on plan assets is derived
    using the expected returns on the individual asset classes,
    weighted by holdings as of year end. The long-term rate of
    return on equity investments is assumed to be

F-35


2.5 percent greater than the yield on local government
    bonds. Expected returns on debt securities are taken directly at
    market yields and cash is taken at the local currency base rate.

Plan
Investment Policies and Strategies

U.S.
Plans

The investment policy reflects the funded status of the plans
    and Marathon’s future ability to make further
    contributions. Historical performance and future expectations
    suggest that common stocks will provide higher total investment
    returns than fixed-income securities over a long-term investment
    horizon. As a result, equity investments will likely continue to
    exceed 50 percent of the value of the fund. Accordingly,
    bond and other fixed income investments will comprise the
    remainder of the fund. Short-term investments shall reflect the
    liquidity requirements for making pension payments. The
    plans’ targeted asset allocation is comprised of
    75 percent equities and 25 percent debt securities.
    Management of the plans’ assets is delegated to the United
    States Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund. The fund manager has
    discretion to move away from the target allocations based upon
    the manager’s judgment as to current confidence or concern
    for the capital markets. Investments are diversified by industry
    and type, limited by grade and maturity. The policy prohibits
    investments in any securities in the steel industry and allows
    derivatives subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance
    and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
    quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset and liability
    studies.

International
Plans

The objective of the investment policy is to achieve a long-term
    return which is consistent with assumptions made by the actuary
    in determining the funding requirements of the plans. The target
    asset allocation of approximately 75 percent equities and
    25 percent debt securities and the unitized pool approach
    meets this objective and controls the various risks to which the
    plans’ assets are exposed, including matching the timing of
    estimated future obligations to the maturities of the
    plans’ assets. The day-to-day management of the plans’
    assets is delegated to several professional investment managers.
    The spread of assets by type and the investment managers’
    policies on investing in individual securities within each type
    provide adequate diversification of investments. The use of
    derivatives by the investment managers is permitted and plan
    specific, subject to strict guidelines. Investment performance
    and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through
    quarterly investment portfolio reviews and periodic asset and
    liability studies.

Cash
Flows

Contributions

Marathon expects to make contributions to their funded pension
    plans in 2006 of between $155 million and
    $345 million. Cash contributions to be paid from the
    general assets of the Company for both the unfunded pension and
    postretirement benefit plans are expected to be approximately $3
    million and $39 million in 2006.

    units have been granted to international participants under the
    plan, 4,182 have vested and 1,900 have been cancelled or
    forfeited. Thus, as of December 31, 2005, 1,139,318 shares
    and 133,918 units were outstanding under the plan.

(b)

Of the shares granted under the 1990 Stock Plan, 610,016 have
    vested and 314,956 have been cancelled or forfeited. As of
    December 31, 2005, no additional shares remain outstanding
    under the plan.

In 2005, 6,975,600 cash-based performance units were granted to
    officers under the 2003 Incentive Compensation Plan, none have
    vested and 144,800 have been cancelled or forfeited. Thus, as of
    December 31, 2005, 6,830,800 units were outstanding under
    the Plan. The target value of each performance unit granted is
    $1, with actual payout varying from zero percent to
    200 percent of the target value based on a 36-month
    measurement period.

On January 1, 2005 and 2004, each non-employee director was
    granted additional stock-based compensation valued at $60,000
    and $40,000, respectively, in the form of common stock units.
    Common stock units are book entry units equal in value to a
    share of stock. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, 24,982, 21,786 and
    15,799 units of stock were issued.

26. Leases

Marathon leases a wide variety of facilities and equipment under
    operating leases, including land and building space, office
    equipment, production facilities and transportation equipment.
    Most long-term leases include renewal options and, in certain
    leases, purchase options. Future minimum commitments for capital
    lease obligations (including sale-leasebacks accounted for as
    financings) and for operating lease obligations having remaining
    noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:

In connection with past sales of various plants and operations,
    Marathon assigned and the purchasers assumed certain leases of
    major equipment used in the divested plants and operations of
    United States Steel. In the event of a default by any of the
    purchasers, United States Steel has assumed these obligations;
    however, Marathon remains

F-38


primarily obligated for payments under these leases. Minimum
    lease payments under these operating lease obligations of
    $37 million have been included above and an equal amount
    has been reported as sublease rentals.

Of the $176 million present value of net minimum capital
    lease payments, $115 million was related to obligations
    assumed by United States Steel under the Financial Matters
    Agreement. Of the $517 million total minimum operating
    lease payments, $8 million was assumed by United States
    Steel under the Financial Matters Agreement.

During 2005, Marathon renewed the lease for its corporate
    headquarters in Houston, Texas. Future minimum lease obligations
    associated with this operating lease are included in the table
    above.

During 2003, Marathon purchased two LNG tankers which were
    previously leased. A $17 million charge was recorded on the
    termination of the operating leases. These tankers are used to
    transport LNG from Kenai, Alaska to Tokyo, Japan.

27. Sale of Minority Interests in EGHoldings

In connection with the formation of Equatorial Guinea LNG
    Holdings Limited, GEPetrol was given certain contractual rights
    that gave GEPetrol the option to purchase and resell a
    13 percent interest in EGHoldings held by Marathon to a
    third party. On July 25, 2005, GEPetrol exercised these
    rights and reimbursed Marathon for its actual costs incurred up
    to the date of closing, plus an additional specified rate of
    return. Marathon and GEPetrol entered into agreements under
    which Mitsui and a subsidiary of Marubeni acquired
    8.5 percent and 6.5 percent interests, respectively,
    in EGHoldings. As part of these agreements, Marathon sold a
    2 percent interest in EGHoldings to Mitsui for its actual
    costs incurred up to the date of closing, plus a specified rate
    of return, as well as a premium and future consideration based
    upon the performance of EGHoldings. Following the transaction,
    Marathon holds a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, with
    GEPetrol holding a 25 percent interest and Mitsui and
    Marubeni holding the remaining interests.

During 2005, Marathon received net proceeds of $163 million
    in connection with the transactions and recorded a gain, which
    is included in other income – net.

28. Contingencies and Commitments

Marathon is the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or
    threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments
    involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations
    relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are
    discussed below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies
    could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
    Marathon’s consolidated financial statements. However,
    management believes that Marathon will remain a viable and
    competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these
    contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.

Environmental matters

– Marathon is
    subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally
    provide for control of pollutants released into the environment
    and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of
    hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for
    noncompliance. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accrued
    liabilities for remediation totaled $103 million and
    $110 million. It is not presently possible to estimate the
    ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred
    or the penalties that may be imposed. Receivables for
    recoverable costs from certain states, under programs to assist
    companies in cleanup efforts related to underground storage
    tanks at retail marketing outlets, were $68 million and
    $65 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

On May 11, 2001, MPC entered into a consent decree with the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which commits it to
    complete certain agreed on environmental projects over an
    eight-year period primarily aimed at reducing air emissions at
    its seven refineries. The court approved this consent decree on
    August 28, 2001. The total one-time expenditures for these
    environmental projects are estimated to be approximately
    $420 million over the eight-year period, with about
    $265 million incurred through December 31, 2005. In
    addition, MPC has nearly completed certain agreed on
    supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement
    of an enforcement action for alleged Clean Air Act violations,
    at a cost of $9 million. Marathon believes that this
    settlement will provide the Company with increased permitting
    and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission
    reductions.

Guarantees

– Marathon has issued the
    following guarantees:

F-40


Contract commitments

– At
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, Marathon’s contract
    commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment totaled
    $668 million and $1.094 billion, respectively. The
    $426 million decrease is primarily due to the continued
    progress of the construction of the Equatorial Guinea LNG plant.

Agreements with joint owners

– As part
    of the formation of PTC, MPC and Pilot Corporation
    (“Pilot”) entered into a Put/ Call and Registration
    Rights Agreement (the “Agreement”). The Agreement
    provides that any time after September 1, 2008, Pilot will
    have the right to sell its interest in PTC to MPC for an amount
    of cash and/or Marathon, MPC or Ashland equity securities equal
    to the product of 90 percent (95 percent if paid in
    securities) of the fair market value of PTC at the time
    multiplied by Pilot’s percentage interest in PTC. At any
    time after September 1, 2011, under certain conditions, MPC
    will have the right to purchase Pilot’s interest in PTC for
    an amount of cash and/or Marathon, MPC or Ashland equity
    securities equal to the product of 105 percent
    (110 percent if paid in securities) of the fair market
    value of PTC at the time multiplied by Pilot’s percentage
    interest in PTC. Under the Agreement, MPC would determine the
    form of consideration to be paid upon exercise of the rights.

29. Subsequent Event

On January 29, 2006, Marathon’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of common
    stock over a period of two years. Such purchases will be made
    during this period as Marathon’s financial condition and
    market conditions warrant. Any purchases under the program may
    be in either open market transactions, including block
    purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. The
    repurchase program does not include specific price targets or
    timetables, and is subject to termination prior to completion.
    Marathon will use cash on hand, cash generated from operations,
    or cash from available borrowings to acquire shares. Shares of
    common stock repurchased under the program will be held as
    treasury shares.

30. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments – an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140.” SFAS No. 155 simplifies the
    accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments, eliminates
    the FASB’s interim guidance which provides that beneficial
    interests in securitized financial assets are not subject to the
    provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and eliminates the
    restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a
    qualifying special-purpose entity may hold. SFAS No. 155 is
    effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after
    the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins
    after September 15, 2006. Marathon is currently studying
    the provisions of this Statement to determine the impact on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by
    the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) on Issue
    No.

04-13,

“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
    Same Counterparty.” The issue defines when a purchase and a
    sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same
    line of business is recorded at fair value or considered a
    single nonmonetary transaction subject to the fair value
    exception of APB Opinion No. 29. The purchase and sale
    transactions may be pursuant to a single contractual arrangement
    or separate contractual arrangements and the inventory purchased
    or sold may be in the form of raw materials, work-in-process, or
    finished goods. In general, two or more transactions with the
    same party are treated as one if they are entered into in
    contemplation of each other. The rules apply to new arrangements
    entered into in reporting periods beginning after March 15,
    2006. The accounting for certain of the transactions that
    Marathon considers as matching buy/sell transactions will be
    affected by this consensus and therefore, upon adoption, these
    transactions will no longer be recorded on a gross basis.
    Marathon is currently studying the provisions of this consensus
    to determine the impact on its consolidated financial
    statements; however, management does not believe any impact on
    net income would be material. There will be no impact on cash
    flows from operations as a result of adoption.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections – A Replacement of APB
    Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” SFAS
    No. 154 requires companies to recognize (1) voluntary
    changes in accounting principle and (2) changes required by
    a new accounting pronouncement, when the pronouncement does not
    include specific transition provisions, retrospectively to prior
    periods’ financial statements, unless it is impracticable
    to determine either the period-specific effects or the
    cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for
    accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2005.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised
    2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS
    No. 123(R)”) as a revision of SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” This
    statement requires entities to measure the cost of employee
    services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
    based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. That
    cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee
    is required to provide service in exchange for the award,
    usually the vesting period. In addition, awards classified as
    liabilities will be remeasured each reporting period. Marathon
    adopted the fair value method under SFAS No. 123 for grants
    made, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003.
    Accordingly, Marathon does not expect the adoption of SFAS
    No. 123(R) to have a material effect on its consolidated
    results of operations, financial position or

F-41


cash flows. The statement provided for an effective date of
    July 1, 2005, for Marathon. However, in April 2005, the
    Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that, for
    Marathon, deferred the effective date until January 1,
    2006. Marathon adopted the provisions of this statement on
    January 1, 2006.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4.” This statement requires that items such as
    idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and
    re-handling costs be recognized as a current-period charge.
    Marathon is required to implement this statement in the first
    quarter of 2006. Marathon does not expect the adoption of SFAS
    No. 151 to have a material effect on its consolidated
    results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Estimated Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Estimates of the proved reserves have been prepared by internal
asset teams including reservoir engineers and geoscience
professionals. Reserve estimates are periodically reviewed by
Marathon’s Corporate Reserves group to assure that rigorous
professional standards and the reserves definitions prescribed
by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are
consistently applied throughout the company.

Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that
geologic and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Estimates of proved reserves may change, either positively or
negatively, as additional information becomes available and as
contractual, economic and political conditions change.

Marathon’s net proved reserve estimates have been adjusted
as necessary to consider all contractual agreements, royalty
obligations and interests owned by others at the time of the
estimate. Only reserves that are estimated to be recovered
during the term of the current contract have been included in
the proved reserve estimate unless there is a clear and
consistent history of contract extension. Reserves from
properties governed by production sharing contracts have been
calculated using the “economic interest” method
prescribed by the SEC. Reserves that are not currently
considered proved, that may result from extensions of currently
proved areas or that may result from applying secondary or
tertiary recovery processes not yet tested and determined to be
economic are excluded. Purchased natural gas utilized in
reservoir management and subsequently resold is also excluded.
Marathon does not have any quantities of oil and gas reserves
subject to long-term supply agreements with foreign governments
or authorities in which Marathon acts as producer.

Proved developed reserves are the quantities of oil and gas
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing
equipment and operating methods. In some cases, proved
undeveloped reserves may require substantial new investments in
additional wells and related facilities. Production volumes
shown are sales volumes, net of any products consumed during
production activities.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and
Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Future cash inflows

are computed by applying year-end
prices of oil and gas relating to Marathon’s proved
reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future
price changes are considered only to the extent provided by
contractual arrangements in existence at year-end.

The assumptions used to compute the proved reserve valuation do
not necessarily reflect Marathon’s expectations of actual
revenues to be derived from those reserves or their present
worth. Assigning monetary values to the estimated quantities of
reserves, described on the preceding page, does not reduce the
subjective and ever-changing nature of such reserve estimates.

Additional subjectivity occurs when determining present values
because the rate of producing the reserves must be estimated. In
addition to uncertainties inherent in predicting the future,
variations from the expected production rate also could result
directly or indirectly from factors outside of Marathon’s
control, such as unintentional delays in development,
environmental concerns, changes in prices or regulatory controls.

The reserve valuation assumes that all reserves will be disposed
of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place or
subjected to participation by foreign governments, additional
economic considerations also could affect the amount of cash
eventually realized.

Future development and production, transportation and
administrative costs

are computed by estimating the
expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the
proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on
year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic
conditions.

Future income tax expenses

are computed by applying the
appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of
future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net
cash flows relating to Marathon’s proved oil and gas
reserves. Oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are
recognized.

Discount

was derived by using a discount rate of
10 percent annually.

(a)

Excludes $(26) million of discounted future net cash flows from
    the effects of hedging transactions for 2003.

Equity Compensation Plans Not
    Approved by Stockholders

Non-Officer Restricted Stock Plan –

The
Non-Officer Restricted Stock Plan was approved by the Board of
Directors effective January 1, 2001, to provide restricted
stock and restricted stock unit awards to non-officer employees
of Marathon and its affiliates. The purposes of the plan are to
reward specific noteworthy achievements by non-officer employees
and promote the retention of outstanding non-officer employees.
All awards under this plan are subject to a four-year time-based
vesting schedule, with 50% of the shares vesting two years from
the date of grant and the remaining 50% of the shares vesting
four years from the date of grant. If a recipient terminates
employment other than by reason of death, any unvested portion
of his or her award will be forfeited. Dividends are paid on all
awards made under the plan prior to vesting. Marathon’s
authority to make grants under this plan was terminated
effective as of April 30, 2003.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors –

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan
for Non-Employee Directors, all non-employee directors of
Marathon were required to defer half of their annual retainers
in the form of common stock units. On the date the retainer
would have otherwise been payable to the non-employee director,
Marathon credited an unfunded bookkeeping account for each
non-employee director with a number of common stock units equal
to half of his or her annual retainer divided by the fair market
value of Marathon’s common stock. The ongoing value of each
common stock unit equals the market price of Marathon’s
common stock. When dividends are paid, Marathon credits each
unfunded account with dividend equivalents on the number of
units then in the individual’s account in the form of
additional common stock units. When the non-employee director
leaves the Board, he or she is issued actual shares of common
stock equal to the number of common stock units in his or her
account at that time. Marathon’s authority to make equity
grants under this plan was terminated effective as of
April 30, 2003.
