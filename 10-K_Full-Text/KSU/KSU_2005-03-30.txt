Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern (“We”, “Our”,
“KCS” or “the Company”), a Delaware
corporation, is a holding company with principal operations in
rail transportation.

KCS, along with its subsidiaries and affiliates, owns and
operates a uniquely positioned North American rail network
strategically focused on the growing north/south freight
corridor that connects key commercial and industrial markets in
the central United States with major industrial cities in
Mexico. Our principal subsidiary, The Kansas City Southern
Railway Company (“KCSR”), which was founded in 1887,
is one of seven Class I railroads. KCSR serves a ten-state
region in the midwest and southern parts of the United States
and has the shortest north/south rail route between Kansas City,
Missouri and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

We own a 51% controlling interest in Mexrail, Inc.
(“Mexrail”). Mexrail owns 100% of The Texas-Mexican
Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex operates a
157-mile rail line extending from Laredo to the port city of
Corpus Christi, Texas and connects the operations of KCSR with
TFM, S.A. de C.V. (“TFM”). Tex-Mex connects with TFM
at the U.S./ Mexico border at Laredo and connects to KCSR
through trackage rights at Beaumont, Texas. Through our
ownership in Mexrail, we own the northern half of the
rail-bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River
between the United States and Mexico. Laredo is a principal
international gateway through which more than 50% of all rail
and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico crosses
the border. Control of the Mexrail shares was not transferred
until January 1, 2005; accordingly, we have recorded our
ownership percentage in Mexrail as an equity investment, as of
December 31, 2004 and our percentage of Mexrail’s
earnings under the equity method of accounting for the year
ended December 31, 2004. Effective January 1, 2005, we
will consolidate the financial statements of Mexrail into the
consolidated financial statements of KCS.

Our rail network also includes an equity investment in Grupo
Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.
(“Grupo TFM”), a 46.6% owned unconsolidated affiliate,
which owns 80% of the stock of TFM. TFM operates a strategically
significant corridor between Mexico and the United States, and
has as its core route a key portion of the shortest, most direct
rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. TFM
serves most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and
three of its major shipping ports. TFM’s rail lines are the
only ones which serve Nuevo Laredo, the largest rail freight
exchange point between the United States and Mexico. TFM,
through its concession with the Mexican government, has the
right to control and operate the southern half of the
rail-bridge at Laredo.

Together, our rail network (KCSR, Tex-Mex, and our interest in
TFM) comprises approximately 6,000 miles of main and branch
lines extending from the midwest portions of the United States
south into Mexico. Additionally, through a strategic alliance
with Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”) and
Illinois Central Corporation (“IC” and together with
CN, “CN/ IC”), our rail network covers approximately
25,000 miles of main and branch lines connecting Canada,
the United States and Mexico. The CN/ IC alliance connects
Canadian markets with major midwestern and southern markets in
the United States, as well as with major markets in Mexico
through KCSR’s connections with Tex-Mex and TFM. Management
believes that, as a result of the strategic position of our rail
network, we are poised to continue to benefit from the growing
north/south trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada
promoted by the North American Free Trade Agreement
(“NAFTA”).

Our rail network is further expanded through marketing
agreements with Norfolk Southern Railway Company (“Norfolk
Southern”), The BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”) and
the Iowa, Chicago & Eastern Railroad Corporation
(“IC&E”). Marketing agreements with Norfolk
Southern allow us to capitalize on our east/west route from
Meridian, Mississippi to Dallas, Texas (“Meridian
Speedway”) to gain incremental traffic volume between the
southeast and the southwest regions of the United States. The
marketing alliance with BNSF was developed to promote
cooperation, revenue growth and extend market



reach for both railroads in the United States and Canada. It is
also designed to improve operating efficiencies for both KCSR
and BNSF in key market areas, as well as provide customers with
expanded service options. KCSR’s marketing agreement with
IC&E provides access to Minneapolis, Minnesota and Chicago,
Illinois and to the origination of corn and other grain traffic
in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois.

Our rail network interconnects with all other Class I
railroads and provides shippers with an effective alternative to
other railroad routes, giving direct access to Mexico and the
southeastern and southwestern United States through less
congested interchange hubs.

We also own 50% of the voting common stock of the Panama Canal
Railway Company (“PCRC”), which holds the concession
to operate a 47-mile coast-to-coast railroad located adjacent to
the Panama Canal. The railroad handles containers in freight
service across the isthmus. Panarail Tourism Company
(“Panarail”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PCRC,
operates commuter and tourist railway services over the lines of
the Panama Canal Railway.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

KCS was organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc. and in 2002 formally changed its name to Kansas City
Southern. KCS, as the holding company, supplies its various
subsidiaries with managerial, legal, tax, financial and
accounting services, in addition to managing other minor
“non-operating” investments.

The information set forth in response to Item 101 of
Regulation S-K under Part II Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” of this
Form 10-K is incorporated by reference in partial response
to this Item 1.

RAIL NETWORK

Owned Network

KCSR owns and operates approximately 3,100 miles of main
and branch lines and 1,250 miles of other tracks in a
ten-state region that includes Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas,
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas and
Illinois. KCSR has the shortest north/south rail route between
Kansas City and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. KCSR’s rail
route includes the Meridian Speedway, linking Meridian,
Mississippi and Dallas, Texas, and the east/west route linking
Kansas City with East St. Louis, Illinois and Springfield,
Illinois. In addition, KCSR has limited haulage rights between
Springfield and Chicago that allow for originating or
terminating shipments on the rail lines of the former Gateway
Western Railway Company (“Gateway Western”). The
former Gateway Western lines also provide access to East
St. Louis and allow rail traffic to avoid the
St. Louis, Missouri terminal. The geographic reach of KCSR
provides service to a diverse customer base that includes
electric generating utilities, which use coal, and a wide range
of companies in the chemical and petroleum, agricultural and
mineral, forest products and metals, and automotive industries.
KCSR has also been very active in developing intermodal traffic.

Eastern railroads and their customers can use our rail network
to bypass the gateways at Chicago; St. Louis; Memphis,
Tennessee and New Orleans, Louisiana by interchanging with KCSR
at Springfield and



East St. Louis and at Meridian and Jackson, Mississippi.
Other railroads can also interconnect with our rail network via
other gateways at Kansas City, Missouri; Birmingham, Alabama;
Shreveport and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Dallas, Beaumont and
Laredo, Texas. KCSR revenues and net income are dependent on
providing reliable service to customers at competitive rates,
the general economic conditions in the geographic region served
and the ability to effectively compete against other rail
carriers and alternative modes of transportation, such as
over-the-road truck transportation and barges. The ability of
KCSR to maintain the roadway in order to provide safe and
efficient transportation service is important to its ongoing
viability as a rail carrier. Additionally, cost containment is
important in maintaining a competitive market position,
particularly with respect to employee costs, as approximately
83% of KCSR’s employees are covered under various
collective bargaining agreements.

Tex-Mex

On August 16, 2004, KCS entered into an agreement with TFM
to purchase Mexrail shares representing 51% ownership of Mexrail
for approximately $32.7 million. The Mexrail shares were
placed in a voting trust pending regulatory approval by the
Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of KCS’s
common control of Tex-Mex, KCSR and the Gateway Eastern Railway
Company (“Gateway Eastern”). On
November  29, 2004, the STB approved KCS’s
application for authority to control Tex-Mex and the
U.S. portion of the International Rail Bridge at Laredo.
That authority became final on December 29, 2004. On
January 1, 2005, the shares representing 51% of Mexrail
were released from the voting trust to KCS, and KCS took control
of Tex-Mex. Under this agreement, KCS has an exclusive option to
purchase from TFM on or before October 31, 2005 the
remaining 49% of the shares of Mexrail. If KCS does not exercise
this option by October 31, 2005, KCS becomes obligated to
purchase such remaining shares on October 31, 2005 at a
purchase price of approximately $31.4 million.

Tex-Mex connects to KCSR through trackage rights over the rail
lines of the Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”)
between Robstown, Texas and Beaumont. These trackage rights were
granted pursuant to a 1996 STB decision and have an initial term
of 99 years. On March 12, 2001, Tex-Mex purchased from
UP a line of railroad right-of-way extending 84.5 miles
between Rosenberg, Texas and Victoria, Texas, and granted
Tex-Mex trackage rights to access the line from the existing
trackage rights. The line is not in service, but extensive
reconstruction is still being planned. Once reconstruction of
the line is completed, Tex-Mex will be able to shorten its
existing route between Corpus Christi and Houston, Texas by over
70 miles.

Significant Investments

Grupo TFM

In December 1995, we entered into a joint venture agreement with
Transportación Marítima Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.,
currently known as Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”) to, among
other things, provide for participation in the privatization of
the Mexican national railway system and to promote the movement
of rail traffic over Tex-Mex, TFM and KCSR. Pursuant to written
notice given by TMM, and in accordance with its terms, the joint
venture agreement was terminated on December 1, 2003.

In 1997, we invested $298 million to obtain a 36.9%
interest in Grupo TFM, the company formed by KCS and TMM under
the joint venture agreement for the purpose of participating in
the privatization of the Mexican national railway system. At the
time that Grupo TFM purchased 80% of the shares of TFM, TMM, the
largest shareholder of Grupo TFM, owned 38.5% of Grupo TFM and
the Mexican government owned the remaining 24.6% of Grupo TFM.
In 2002, KCS and TMM exercised their call option on the Mexican
government’s Grupo TFM shares and, on July 29, 2002,
TFM completed the purchase of the Mexican government’s
24.6% ownership of Grupo TFM. The $256.1 million purchase
price was funded utilizing a combination of proceeds from an
offering of debt securities by TFM, a credit from the Mexican
government for the reversion of certain rail facilities and
other resources. This transaction increased our ownership
percentage of Grupo TFM from 36.9% to approximately 46.6%. Grupo
TFM owns 80% of the stock of TFM (which represents all of the
shares entitled to full voting rights), while the remaining 20%
of TFM (with limited voting rights) is owned by the Mexican
government.



TFM holds the concession, which was awarded by the Mexican
government in 1996, to operate Mexico’s Northeast Rail
Lines (the “Concession”; the Northeast Rail Lines are
now known as “TFM”) for 50 years ending in June
2047. Subject to certain conditions, TFM has an option to extend
the Concession for an additional 50 years. The Concession
is subject to certain mandatory trackage rights and is exclusive
until 2027. The Mexican government, however, may revoke
TFM’s exclusivity after 2017 if it determines that there is
insufficient competition, and may terminate the Concession as a
result of certain conditions or events, including
(1) TFM’s failure to meet its operating and financial
obligations with regard to the Concession under applicable
Mexican law, (2) a statutory appropriation by the Mexican
government for reasons of public interest and
(3) liquidation or bankruptcy of TFM. TFM’s assets and
its rights under the Concession may, under certain circumstances
such as natural disaster, war or other similar situations, also
be seized temporarily by the Mexican government.

Under the Concession, TFM operates a strategically significant
corridor between Mexico and the United States, and has as its
core route a key portion of the shortest, most direct rail
passageway between Mexico City and Laredo. TFM’s rail lines
are the only ones which serve Nuevo Laredo, the largest rail
freight exchange point between the United States and Mexico.
TFM’s rail lines connect the most populated and
industrialized regions of Mexico with Mexico’s principal
U.S. border railway gateway at Laredo. In addition, TFM
serves three of Mexico’s primary seaports at Veracruz and
Tampico on the Gulf of Mexico and Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific
Ocean. TFM serves 15 Mexican states and Mexico City, which
together represent a majority of the country’s population
and account for a majority of its estimated gross domestic
product. TFM operates approximately 2,650 miles of main and
branch lines and certain additional sidings, spur tracks and
main line tracks under trackage rights. TFM has the right to
operate the rail lines through the Concession, but does not own
the land, roadway or associated structures. Through Tex-Mex and
KCSR, as well as through interchanges with other major
U.S. railroads, TFM provides its customers with access to
an extensive rail network through which they may distribute
their products throughout North America and overseas.

TFM is both a strategic and financial investment for KCS.
Strategically, our investment in TFM promotes the NAFTA growth
strategy, whereby we and our strategic partners can provide
transportation services between the heart of Mexico’s
industrial base, the United States and Canada. TFM’s
strategy is to provide reliable customer service, capitalize on
foreign trade growth and convert truck tonnage to rail. In doing
so, TFM expects to establish its railroad as the primary inland
freight transporter linking Mexico to U.S. and Canadian markets
along the NAFTA corridor. TFM’s operating strategy has been
to increase productivity and maximize operating efficiencies.
With Mexico’s economic progress, growth of NAFTA trade
between Mexico, the United States and Canada, and customer
focused rail service, KCS management believes that the growth
potential of TFM could be significant.

As further described in Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Recent Developments — KCS and
TMM Enter Into Amended Acquisition Agreement”, on
April 20, 2003, KCS and TMM entered into an agreement,
referred to as the “Original Acquisition Agreement,”
for the acquisition by KCS of control of TFM (the
“Acquisition”). The Original Acquisition Agreement was
not consummated due to disputes arising between the parties
which led to litigation and arbitration. On December 15,
2004, KCS and TMM entered into an Amended and Restated
Acquisition Agreement (“Acquisition Agreement”)
amending and restating the Original Acquisition Agreement.

Pending closing under the Acquisition Agreement, KCS and TMM and
certain affiliates operate under the May 1997 shareholders
agreement. The shareholders agreement, which governs our
investment in Grupo TFM: (1) restricts each of the parties
to the shareholders agreement from directly or indirectly
transferring any interest in Grupo TFM or TFM to a competitor of
Grupo TFM, TFM or other parties without the prior written
consent of each of the parties, and (2) provides that KCS
and TMM may not transfer control of any subsidiary holding all
or any portion of shares of Grupo TFM to a third party, other
than an affiliate of the transferring party or another party to
the shareholders agreement, without the consent of the other
parties to the shareholders agreement. The Grupo TFM bylaws
prohibit any transfer of shares of Grupo TFM to any person other
than an affiliate of the existing shareholders without the prior
consent of Grupo TFM’s board of directors. In addition, the
Grupo TFM bylaws grant the shareholders of Grupo TFM a right of
first refusal to acquire shares to be transferred by any other
shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by each



non-transferring shareholder; although holders of preferred
shares or shares with special or limited rights are only
entitled to acquire those shares and not ordinary shares. The
shareholders agreement requires that the boards of directors of
Grupo TFM and TFM be constituted to reflect the parties’
relative ownership of the ordinary voting common stock of Grupo
TFM.

Under the terms of the January 31, 1997 share purchase
agreement through which Grupo TFM agreed to purchase the shares
of TFM, as amended by the parties on June 9, 1997 (the
“TFM Share Purchase Agreement”), the Mexican
government has the right to compel the purchase of its 20%
interest in TFM (referred to as the “Put”) by Grupo
TFM following its compliance with the terms and conditions of
the TFM Share Purchase Agreement. Upon exercise of the Put in
accordance with the terms of the TFM Share Purchase Agreement,
Grupo TFM would be obligated to purchase the TFM capital stock
at the initial share price paid by Grupo TFM adjusted for
interest and inflation. Prior to October 30, 2003, Grupo
TFM filed suit in the Federal District Court of Mexico City
seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment interpreting
whether Grupo TFM was obligated to honor its obligation under
the TFM Share Purchase Agreement, as the Mexican government had
not made any effort to sell the TFM shares subject to the Put
prior to October 31, 2003. In its suit, Grupo TFM named TMM
and KCS as additional interested parties. The Mexican Court has
admitted Grupo TFM’s complaint and issued an injunction
that blocked the Mexican government from exercising the Put. The
Mexican government provided Grupo TFM with notice of its
intention to sell its interest in TFM on October 30, 2003.
Grupo TFM has responded to the Mexican government’s notice
reaffirming its right and interest in purchasing the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM, but also advising
the Mexican government that it would not take any action until
its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment was resolved. In the
event that Grupo TFM does not purchase the Mexican
government’s 20% interest in TFM, TMM and KCS, or either of
TMM or KCS alone, would, following notification by the Mexican
government in accordance with the terms of the TFM Share
Purchase Agreement, be obligated to purchase the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM. As this matter is
currently the subject of litigation in Mexico to which the
Mexican government, Grupo TFM, TMM and KCS are parties, KCS
management does not believe it is likely that the Mexican
government will seek to exercise the Put until the litigation is
resolved. On completion of the Acquisition, KCS will assume
TMM’s rights and obligations to make any payment upon the
exercise by the Mexican government of its right to compel the
purchase of its 20% interest in TFM in accordance with the
applicable agreements and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates,
and their respective officers, directors, employees and
shareholders, against obligations or liabilities relating
thereto.

Panama Canal Railway Company

In January 1998, the Republic of Panama awarded PCRC, a joint
venture company formed by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc.
(“Mi-Jack”), the concession to reconstruct and operate
the Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to
the Panama Canal that provides international shippers with a
railway transportation option to complement the Panama Canal.
The Panama Canal Railway, which traces its origins back to the
late 1800s, is a north-south railroad traversing the Panama
isthmus between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The railroad
has been reconstructed and resumed freight operations in
December 2001. While only 47 miles long, management
believes the Panama Canal Railway provides a unique opportunity
to participate in transoceanic shipments as a complement to the
existing Panama Canal traffic. Management believes the potential
for this railroad is in the service of shipping customers who
need to reposition containers between the ports of Balboa and
Colon without passing through the Canal. In addition, there is
demand for passenger traffic for both commuter and
pleasure/tourist travel. Panarail operates and promotes commuter
and tourist passenger service over the Panama Canal Railway.
Passenger service started during July 2001.

As of December 31, 2004, we have invested approximately
$23.9 million toward the reconstruction and operations of
the Panama Canal Railway. This investment is comprised of
$12.9 million of equity and $11.0 million of
subordinated loans. These loans carry a 10% interest rate and
are payable on demand, subject to certain restrictions.

In November 1999, PCRC completed the financing for the
reconstruction project with the International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”), a member of the World Bank Group.
The financing is comprised of a



$5 million investment by the IFC and senior loans through
the IFC in an aggregate amount of up to $39.4 million.
Additionally, PCRC has $5.8 million of equipment loans and
other capital leases totaling $2.0 million. The IFC’s
investment of $5 million in PCRC is comprised of non-voting
preferred shares which pay a 10% cumulative dividend. As of
December 31, 2004, PCRC has recorded a $2.5 million
liability for these cumulative preferred dividends. The
preferred shares may be redeemed at the IFC’s option any
year after 2008 at the lower of (1) a net cumulative
internal rate of return of 30% or (2) eight times earnings
before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization for
the two years preceding the redemption that is proportionate to
the IFC’s percentage ownership in PCRC. On March 28,
2005, PCRC and the IFC finalized an agreement whereby PCRC would
redeem the shares subscribed and owned by IFC pursuant to the
IFC Subscription. Under the agreement, PCRC will pay to the IFC
$10.5 million. These shares have a recorded value of
$5.0 million and approximately $2.6 million in accrued
unpaid dividends. When the transaction is completed, PCRC will
record an additional cost of approximately $2.9 million to
reflect the premium paid to IFC and, as a result, KCS expects to
record its share of this cost of approximately $1.5 million
in recording its equity in earnings of PCRC in the first quarter
of 2005.

Under the terms of the loan agreement with IFC, we are a
guarantor for up to $5.6 million of the associated debt.
Also if PCRC terminates the concession contract without the
IFC’s consent, KCS is a guarantor for up to 50% of the
outstanding senior loans. KCS is also a guarantor for up to
$3.0 million of the equipment loans and approximately
$100,000 relating to other capital leases. The cost of the
reconstruction totaled approximately $80 million. We expect
to loan an additional $0.1 million to PCRC during 2005
under the same terms as the existing $19.5 million
subordinated loans.

Southern Capital

In 1996, KCSR and GATX Capital Corporation (“GATX”)
formed a 50-50 joint venture — Southern
Capital — to perform certain leasing and financing
activities. Southern Capital’s operations consist primarily
of the acquisition of locomotives, and other rail equipment and
the leasing thereof to KCSR. Concurrent with the formation of
this joint venture, KCSR entered into operating leases with
Southern Capital for substantially all the locomotives and
rolling stock that KCSR contributed or sold to Southern Capital
at the time of formation of the joint venture. GATX contributed
cash in the joint venture transaction formation.

The purpose for the formation of Southern Capital was to partner
a Class I railroad in KCSR with an industry leader in rail
equipment financing in GATX. Southern Capital provides KCSR with
access to equipment financing alternatives.

Expanded Network

Through our strategic alliance with CN/ IC and marketing
agreements with Norfolk Southern, BNSF and the IC&E, KCS has
expanded the domestic geographic reach beyond that covered by
its owned network.

Strategic Alliance with Canadian National and Illinois
    Central.

In 1998, KCSR, CN and IC entered into a 15-year strategic
alliance to coordinate the marketing, operations and investment
elements of north-south rail freight transportation. This
alliance connects Canadian markets, the major midwest
U.S. markets of Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Kansas City and
St. Louis and the key southern markets of Memphis, Dallas
and Houston. It also provides U.S. and Canadian shippers with
access to Mexico’s rail system through connections with
Tex-Mex and TFM.

In addition to providing access to key north-south international
and domestic U.S. traffic corridors, the alliance with CN/
IC is intended to increase business in all commodity groups and
positioned KCS as a key provider of rail service for NAFTA
trade. KCSR and CN formed a management group made up of senior
management representatives from both railroads to guide the
realization of the alliance goals and develop plans for the
construction of new facilities to support business development,
including investments in automotive, intermodal and transload
facilities at Memphis, Dallas, Kansas City and Chicago.



Under a separate agreement, KCSR was granted certain trackage
and haulage rights and CN and IC were granted certain haulage
rights. Under the terms of this agreement, and through action
taken by the STB, in 2000 KCSR gained access to six additional
chemical customers in the Geismar, Louisiana industrial area
through haulage rights.

Marketing Agreements with Norfolk Southern.

In December 1997, KCSR entered into a marketing agreement with
Norfolk Southern and Tex-Mex that allows KCSR to increase its
traffic volume along the east-west corridor between Meridian and
Dallas by using interchange points with Norfolk Southern. This
agreement provides Norfolk Southern run-through service with
access to Dallas and the Mexican border at Laredo while avoiding
the rail gateways of Memphis and New Orleans. This agreement was
renewed in December 2003 for a term of three years and will be
automatically renewed for additional three-year terms unless
written notice of termination is given at least 90 days
prior to the expiration of the then-current term.

In May 2000, KCSR entered into an additional marketing agreement
with Norfolk Southern under which KCSR provides haulage services
for intermodal traffic between Meridian and Dallas in exchange
for fees from Norfolk Southern. Under this agreement Norfolk
Southern may quote rates and enter into transportation service
contracts with shippers and receivers covering this haulage
traffic. Under the current arrangement, which expires on
December 31, 2006, trains run between KCSR’s
connection with Norfolk Southern at Meridian and the BNSF
connection at Dallas. The structure of the agreement provides
for lower gross revenue to KCSR, but improved operating income
since, as a haulage arrangement, locomotives, locomotive fuel
and car hire expenses are the responsibility of Norfolk
Southern, not KCSR.

Marketing Alliance with BNSF

In April 2002, KCSR and BNSF formed a comprehensive joint
marketing alliance aimed at promoting cooperation, revenue
growth and extending market reach for both railroads in the
United States and Canada. The marketing alliance was also
designed to improve operating efficiencies for both carriers in
key market areas, as well as provide customers with expanded
service options. KCSR and BNSF have agreed to coordinate
marketing and operational initiatives in a number of target
markets. The marketing alliance allows the two railroads to be
more responsive to shippers’ requests for rates and service
across the two rail networks. Coal and unit train operations are
excluded from the marketing alliance, as well as any points
where KCSR and BNSF are the only direct rail competitors.
Movements to and from Mexico by either party are also excluded.
Management believes this marketing alliance provides shippers
with enhanced options and competitive alternatives as well as
opportunities to grow KCSR’s revenue base, particularly in
the chemical, grain and forest product markets through expanded
access to important markets.

Marketing Agreement with IC&E.

KCSR is a party to a marketing agreement with IC&E. This
marketing agreement provides KCSR with access to Minneapolis and
Chicago and to the origination of corn and other grain traffic
in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. Through this marketing
agreement, KCSR receives and originates shipments of grain
products for delivery to poultry industry feed mills on its
network. Grain is currently KCSR’s largest export into
Mexico. This agreement can be terminated with 90 days
notice.

Haulage Rights.

As a result of the 1988 acquisition of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad by UP, KCSR was granted (1) haulage rights between
Kansas City and each of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha and Lincoln,
Nebraska and Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, and (2) a joint
rate agreement for our grain traffic between Beaumont and each
of Houston and Galveston, Texas. KCSR has the right to convert
these haulage rights to trackage rights. KCSR’s haulage
rights require UP to move KCSR traffic in UP trains; trackage
rights would allow KCSR to operate its trains over UP tracks.
These rights have a term of 199 years. In addition, KCSR
has limited



haulage rights between Springfield and Chicago for shipments
that originate or terminate on the former Gateway Western’s
rail lines.

Chemical and Petroleum

KCSR transports chemical and petroleum products via tank and
hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast
United States through interchanges with other rail carriers.
Primary traffic includes plastics, petroleum and oils, petroleum
coke, rubber, and miscellaneous chemicals. KCSR’s access to
six additional chemical customers in the Geismar, Louisiana
industrial corridor has resulted in additional revenue for KCSR
and management believes it could provide future competitive
opportunities for revenue growth as existing contracts with
other rail carriers expire for these customers.

Forest Products and Metals

KCSR’s rail lines run through the heart of the southeastern
U.S. timber-producing region. We believe that forest
products made from trees in this region are generally less
expensive than those from other regions due to lower production
costs. As a result, southern yellow pine products from the
southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western
producers who have experienced capacity reductions because of
public policy considerations. KCSR serves paper mills directly
and indirectly through short-line connections. Primary traffic
includes pulp and paper, lumber, panel products (plywood and
oriented strand board), engineered wood products, pulpwood,
woodchips, raw fiber used in the production of paper, pulp and
paperboard, as well as metal, scrap and slab steel, waste and
military equipment. Slab steel products are used primarily in
the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry, and military
equipment is shipped to and from several military bases on
KCSR’s rail lines.

Agricultural and Mineral

Agricultural products consist of domestic and export grain, food
and related products. Shipper demand for agricultural products
is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain
products, as well as price fluctuations in international markets
for key commodities. In the domestic grain business, KCSR’s
rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain
products for delivery to feed mills serving the poultry
industry. Through the marketing agreement with IC&E,
KCSR’s rail lines have access to sources of corn and other
grain in Iowa and other midwestern states. KCSR currently serves
feed mills along its rail lines throughout Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Export grain
shipments include primarily wheat, soybeans and corn transported
to Mexico via Laredo and to the Gulf of Mexico for overseas
destinations. Over the long term, export grain shipments are
expected to increase as a result of Mexico’s reliance on
grain imports. Food and related products consist mainly of
soybean meal, grain meal, oils and canned goods, sugar and beer.
Mineral shipments consist of a variety of products including
ores, clay, stone and cement.



Intermodal and Automotive

The intermodal freight business consists primarily of hauling
freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water,
rail and motor carriers, with rail carriers serving as the link
between the other modes of transportation. Through KCSR’s
dedicated intermodal train service between Meridian and Dallas,
we compete directly with truck carriers along the Interstate 20
corridor.

The intermodal business is highly price sensitive and service
driven as the trucking industry maintains certain competitive
advantages over the rail industry. Trucks are not obligated to
provide or maintain rights of way and do not have to pay real
estate taxes on their routes. In prior years, the trucking
industry diverted a substantial amount of freight from railroads
as truck operators’ efficiency over long distances
increased. In response to these competitive pressures, the
railroad industry forged alliances with truck companies in order
to move more traffic by rail and provide faster, safer and more
efficient service to their customers. KCSR has entered into
agreements with several trucking companies for train service
concentrated between Dallas and Meridian.

The strategic alliance with CN/ IC and marketing agreements with
Norfolk Southern provide KCSR the opportunity to further
capitalize on the growth potential of intermodal freight
revenues, particularly for traffic moving between points in the
upper midwest and Canada to Kansas City, Dallas and Mexico.

Furthermore, KCSR is developing the former Richards-Gebaur
Airbase in Kansas City as a U.S. customs pre-clearance
processing facility, the Kansas City International Freight
Gateway (“IFG”), which is expected to handle and
process large volumes of domestic and international intermodal
freight. Through an agreement with Mazda, KCSR has developed an
automotive loading and distribution facility at IFG. This
loading and distribution facility became operational in April
2000 for the movement of Mazda vehicles. Other automotive
traffic consists primarily of vehicle parts moving into Mexico
from the northern sections of the United States and finished
vehicles moving from Mexico into the United States. Our rail
network essentially serves as the connecting bridge carrier for
these movements of automotive parts and finished vehicles.

Coal

Coal historically has been one of the most stable sources of
revenues and is the largest single commodity handled by KCSR.
Substantially all coal customers are under long term contracts,
which typically have an average contract term of approximately
five years. KCSR, directly or indirectly, delivers coal to ten
electric generating plants, in, Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, and
Louisiana. Principally all the coal KCSR transports originates
in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and is transferred to
KCSR’s rail lines at Kansas City.

Other

Other rail-related revenues include a variety of miscellaneous
services provided to customers and interconnecting carriers.
Major items in this category include railcar switching services,
demurrage (railcar retention penalties) and drayage (local truck
transportation services).

Railroad Industry

Overview

U.S. railroad companies are categorized by the STB into
three types: Class I, Class II (Regional) and
Class III (Local). Currently, there are seven Class I
railroads in the United States, which can be further divided
geographically by eastern or western classification. The eastern
railroads are CSX Corporation (“CSX”), Grand Trunk
Corporation (which is owned by CN and includes IC and Wisconsin
Central Transportation Corporation — “Wisconsin
Central”) and Norfolk Southern. The western railroads
include BNSF, KCSR, Soo Line Railroad Company (owned by Canadian
Pacific Railway Company (“CP”)) and UP.



The STB and Regulation

The STB, an independent body administratively housed within the
Department of Transportation, is responsible for the economic
regulation of railroads within the United States. The STB’s
mission is to ensure that competitive, efficient and safe
transportation services are provided to meet the needs of
shippers, receivers and consumers. The STB was created by an Act
of Congress known as the ICC Termination Act of 1995
(“ICCTA”). Passage of the ICCTA represented a further
step in the process of streamlining and reforming the Federal
economic regulatory oversight of the railroad, trucking and bus
industries that was initiated in the late 1970’s and early
1980’s. The STB is authorized to have three members, each
with a five-year term of office. The STB Chairman is designated
by the President of the United States from among the STB’s
members. The STB adjudicates disputes and regulates interstate
surface transportation. Railway transportation matters under the
STB’s jurisdiction in general include railroad rate and
service issues, rail restructuring transactions (mergers, line
sales, line construction and line abandonment) and certain
railroad labor matters.

Railroad Consolidation

On June 11, 2001, the STB issued new rules governing major
railroad mergers and consolidations involving two or more
“Class I” railroads. These rules substantially
increase the burden on rail merger applicants to demonstrate
that a proposed transaction would be in the public interest. The
rules require applicants to demonstrate that, among other
things, a proposed transaction would enhance competition where
necessary to offset negative effects of the transaction, such as
competitive harm, and to address fully the impact of the
transaction on transportation service. The STB recognized,
however, that a merger between KCSR and another Class I
carrier would not necessarily raise the same concerns and risks
as potential mergers between larger Class I railroads.
Accordingly, the STB decided that for a merger proposal
involving KCSR and another Class I railroad, the STB will
waive the application of the new rules and apply the rules
previously in effect unless it is persuaded that the new rules
should apply.

Competition

Our rail operations compete against other railroads, many of
which are much larger and have significantly greater financial
and other resources. Since 1994, there has been significant
consolidation among major North American rail carriers. As a
result of this consolidation, the railroad industry is now
dominated by a few “mega-carriers.” We regard the
larger western railroads (BNSF and UP), in particular, as
significant competitors to our operations and prospects because
of their substantial resources. The ongoing impact of these
mergers is uncertain. We believe that because of our investments
and strategic alliances, we are positioned to attract additional
rail traffic through our rail network.

We are subject to competition from motor carriers, barge lines,
and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain routes
in operating areas. Truck carriers have eroded the railroad
industry’s share of total transportation revenues. Changing
regulations, subsidized highway improvement programs and
favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive
position of trucks in the United States as an alternative mode
of surface transportation for many commodities. In the United
States, the trucking industry generally is more cost and
transit-time competitive than railroads for short-haul
distances. In addition, Mississippi and Missouri River barge
traffic, among others, compete with KCSR and our rail
connections in the transportation of bulk commodities such as
grains, steel and petroleum products. Intermodal traffic and
certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition,
particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers,
including KCSR, have placed an emphasis on competing in the
intermodal marketplace and working together with motor carriers
and each other to provide end-to-end transportation of products.

While deregulation of freight rates has enhanced the ability of
railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes
of transportation, this increased competition has resulted in
downward pressure on freight rates. Competition with other
railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based
on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service
provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for
certain commodities.



Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2004, KCS and its subsidiaries had
approximately 2,680 employees.

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
(“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
renegotiated when they become open for modification, but their
terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached.
Typically, neither management nor labor employees are permitted
to take economic action until extended procedures are exhausted.

Approximately 83% of KCSR employees are covered under various
collective bargaining agreements with different labor
organizations. A negotiating process for new collective
bargaining agreements representing all of KCSR’s union
employees has been in process since November 1, 1999.
Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues
have been negotiated on an industry-wide scale. Previously,
these negotiations, which can take place over significant
periods of time, have not resulted in any extended work
interruptions. The existing agreements will remain in effect
until new agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures
are exhausted. Until new agreements are reached, the current
agreements provide for periodic wage adjustments.

Railroad Retirement Act and Railroad Retirement Improvement
    Act

Railroad industry personnel are covered by the Railroad
Retirement Act (“RRA”) instead of the Social Security
Act. Employer contributions under the RRA are currently
substantially higher than those under the Social Security Act
and may rise further because of the increasing proportion of
retired employees receiving benefits relative to the number of
working employees. For 2004, the RRA required up to a 20.75%
contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages while the
Social Security and Medicare Acts only require a 7.65% employer
contribution on similar wage bases. Of the 20.75% the first
component, Tier 1 is based on factors corresponding to the
Social Security rates while Tier 2 (currently 13.1%) is
based on a formula. Under the Railroad Retirement and
Survivors’ Improvement Act of 2001 (“RRIA”), the
formula method can produce a Tier 2 rate between 8.2% and
22.1%.

On December 21, 2001, the RRIA was signed into law. This
legislation liberalizes early retirement benefits for employees
with 30 years of service by reducing the full benefit age
from 62 to 60, eliminates a cap on monthly retirement and
disability benefits, lowers the minimum service requirement from
10 years to 5 years of service, and provides for
increased benefits for surviving spouses. It also provides for
the investment of railroad retirement funds in non-governmental
assets, adjustments in the payroll tax rates paid by employees
and employers, and the repeal of a supplemental annuity
work-hour tax. The RRIA reduced the employer contribution for
payroll taxes by 1.1%, 1.4%, and 0.5% in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Railroad industry personnel are also covered by the Federal
Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”) rather than
state workers’ compensation systems. FELA is a fault-based
system with compensation for injuries settled by negotiation and
litigation, which can be expensive and time-consuming. By
contrast, most other industries are covered by state
administered no-fault plans with standard compensation
schedules. The difference in the labor regulations for the rail
industry compared to the non-rail industries illustrates the
competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by
federal labor regulations.

Insurance

We maintain multiple insurance programs for our various
subsidiaries including rail liability and property, general
liability, directors and officers’ coverage, workers
compensation coverage and various specialized coverage for
specific entities as needed. Coverage for KCSR is by far the
most significant part of our program. It includes liability
coverage up to $250 million, subject to a $5 million
deductible and certain aggregate limitations, and property
coverage up to $200 million, subject to a $5 million
deductible ($10 million deductible in the event of flood or
earthquake) and certain aggregate limitations. KCS management
believes that our insurance program is in line with industry
norms given our size and provides adequate coverage for
potential losses.

KCSR’s fleet of locomotives and rolling stock consisted of
the following at December 31:

As of December 31, 2004, KCSR’s fleet consisted of 518
diesel locomotives, of which 239 were owned, 258 leased from
Southern Capital and 21 leased from non-affiliates. KCSR’s
fleet of rolling stock consisted of 13,277 freight cars, of
which 2,755 were owned, 3,376 leased from Southern Capital and
7,146 leased from



non-affiliates. The locomotives and freight cars leased from
Southern Capital secure pass through certificates issued by
Southern Capital during 2002.

The owned equipment is subject to liens created under senior
secured credit facilities, as well as liens created under
certain capital leases and equipment trust certificates. KCSR
indebtedness with respect to equipment trust certificates and
capital leases totaled approximately $12.3 million at
December 31, 2004.

KCSR, in support of its transportation operations, owns and
operates repair shops, depots and office buildings along its
right-of-way. A major facility, the Deramus Yard, is located in
Shreveport, Louisiana and includes a general office building,
locomotive repair shop, car repair shops, customer service
center, material warehouses and fueling facilities totaling
approximately 227,000 square feet. KCSR also owns freight
warehousing and office facilities in Dallas, Texas totaling
approximately 150,000 square feet. Other facilities owned
by KCSR include a 21,000 square foot freight car repair
shop in Kansas City, Missouri and approximately
15,000 square feet of office space in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana. KCSR also has the support of a locomotive repair
facility in Kansas City. This facility is owned and operated by
General Electric Company (“GE”) and is used to
maintain and repair AC 4400 locomotives that were manufactured
by GE and are leased by KCSR.

In June 2001, we entered into a 17-year lease agreement for a
new corporate headquarters building in downtown Kansas City,
Missouri. In April 2002, we moved our corporate offices into
this building. Our corporate offices had previously been located
in another building in downtown Kansas City, which was leased
from a subsidiary until the building was sold in June 2001.

KCSR owns five intermodal facilities and has contracted with
third parties to operate these facilities. These facilities are
located in Dallas, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Shreveport and
New Orleans, Louisiana; and Jackson, Mississippi. During 2003,
we expanded the capacity of our Dallas and Shreveport facilities
through capital improvements. Leased facilities include an
automobile storage and loading facility at the IFG in Kansas
City, Missouri. Intermodal and automotive operations at the
facility may be further expanded in the future as business
opportunities arise. The various intermodal facilities include
strip tracks, cranes and other equipment used in facilitating
the transfer and movement of trailers and containers.

KCSR also has ten bulk transload facilities, including
facilities in Kansas City, Missouri; Spiro, Oklahoma; Sauget,
Illinois; Lake Charles and Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jackson; and
Vicksburg, Mississippi; and Pittsburg, Kansas, Dallas and Port
Arthur, Texas. Due to growth in transload traffic, KCSR expanded
its Jackson facility in 2003. In 2003, KCSR opened the transload
facility in Pittsburg and returned to service a 70-acre bulk
commodity handling facility in Port Arthur. Transload operations
consist of rail/truck shipments whereby the products shipped are
unloaded from the trailer, container or rail car and reloaded
onto the other mode of transportation. Transload is similar to
intermodal, except that intermodal shipments transfer the entire
container or trailer and transload shipments transfer only the
product being shipped.

KCSR owns 16.6% of the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company,
which owns and operates approximately 80 miles of track,
and operates an additional eight miles of track under trackage
rights in greater Kansas City, Missouri. KCSR also leases for
operating purposes certain short sections of trackage owned by
various other railroad companies and jointly owns certain other
facilities with these railroads.

Grupo TFM

TFM operates approximately 2,650 miles of main and branch
lines and certain additional sidings, spur tracks and main line
under trackage rights. Under its Concession from the Mexican
government, TFM has the right to operate the rail lines, but
does not own the land, roadway or associated structures.
Approximately 76% of the main line operated by TFM consists of
continuously welded rail. As of December 31, 2004, TFM
owned 467 locomotives, owned or leased from affiliates 4,278
freight cars and leased from non-affiliates 150 locomotives and
8,719 freight cars. Grupo TFM (through TFM) has office space at
which various operational, administrative, managerial and other
activities are performed. The primary facilities are located in
Mexico City and Monterrey, Mexico. TFM leases 94,915 square
feet of office space in Mexico City and holds, under the
Concession, a 115,157 square foot facility in Monterrey.



Panama Canal Railway Company

PCRC leases three locomotives and owns seven locomotives. PCRC
also owns 22 double stack cars, 6 passenger cars and various
other infrastructure improvements and equipment. Under the
concession, PCRC constructed and operates intermodal terminal
facilities at each end of its railroad and an approximate
15,000 square foot equipment maintenance facility. All of
this property and equipment is subject to liens securing PCRC
debt as further described in Item 1,
“Business — Rail Network — Significant
Investments — Panama Canal Railway Company.”

Other

We own 1,025 acres of property located on the waterfront in
the Port Arthur, Texas area, which includes 22,000 linear feet
of deep-water frontage and three docks. Port Arthur is an
uncongested port with direct access to the Gulf of Mexico.
Approximately 75% of this property is available for development.

Trans-Serve, Inc. owns and operates a railroad wood tie treating
plant in Vivian, Louisiana. This facility includes buildings
totaling approximately 12,000 square feet.

Pabtex LP owns a 70-acre bulk commodity handling facility in
Port Arthur, Texas.

KCSR owns a microwave system formerly owned and operated by
Mid-South Microwave, Inc. prior to its merger into KCSR
effective December 31, 2002. This system extends
essentially along the right-of-way of KCSR from Kansas City to
Dallas, Beaumont and Port Arthur and New Orleans.

Other subsidiaries of KCS own approximately 5,500 acres of
land at various points adjacent to the KCSR right-of-way. Other
properties owned include a 354,000 square foot warehouse at
Shreveport and several former railway buildings now being rented
to non-affiliated companies, primarily as warehouse space.

In the opinion of management, the various facilities, office
space and other properties owned and/or leased by KCS and its
subsidiaries are adequate for current operating needs.

Borrowings under the 2004 Credit Facility are secured by
substantially all of the Company’s assets and are
guaranteed by the majority of its subsidiaries.

On May 5, 2003, KCS completed the sale of $200 million
(400,000 shares) of 4.25% Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (“Convertible
Preferred Stock”), with a



liquidation preference of $500 per share in a private
offering under Rule 144A to qualified institutional buyers.
Net proceeds to KCS were $193 million after fees to the
initial purchasers of $7 million and other expenses of the
offering. Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are
cumulative and will be payable quarterly at an annual rate of
4.25% of the liquidation preference, when, and if declared by
our Board of Directors. Accumulated unpaid dividends will
accumulate dividends at the same 4.25% rate. Each share of the
Convertible Preferred Stock will be convertible, under certain
conditions, and subject to adjustment under certain conditions,
into 33.4728 shares of our common stock. Conversion rights
arise only upon the occurrence of the following: (i) the
closing sale price of KCS’s common stock exceeds a
specified level for a specified period; (ii) upon certain
credit rating downgrades; (iii) upon the convertible
preferred stock trading below a certain level for a specified
period; (iv) upon notice of redemption; and (v) upon
the occurrence of certain corporate transactions. On or after
May 20, 2008, KCS will have the option to redeem any or all
of the Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain
conditions. Under certain circumstances, at the option of the
holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, KCS may be required
to purchase shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock from the
holders. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the
Convertible Preferred Stock has been used to reduce debt. The
remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible
Preferred Stock are expected to be used to pay a portion of the
purchase price for the proposed acquisition of a controlling
interest of Grupo TFM (See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Recent Developments — KCS and
TMM Enter into Acquisition Agreement”) or to further reduce
debt.

On August, 1, 2003, KCS filed a Form S-3 Registration
Statement with the SEC to register, for resale by the holders,
the Convertible Preferred Stock and the common stock into which
such preferred stock may be converted. On October 24, 2003,
this Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective
by the SEC. KCS has filed, and will continue to file,
post-effective amendments to this Registration Statement as
required by applicable rules and regulations. KCS will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities under this
Registration Statement, as amended.

As of February 28, 2005, there were 4,990 record holders of
our common stock.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

KCS, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with principal
operations in rail transportation and its principal subsidiaries
and affiliates include the following:

KCS was organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc. and in 2002 formally changed its name to Kansas City
Southern. KCS, as the holding company, supplies its various
subsidiaries with managerial, legal, tax, financial and
accounting services, in addition to managing other minor
“non-operating” investments.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

KCS operates under one reportable business segment in the rail
transportation industry and KCSR, our principal subsidiary, is
the smallest of the Class I railroads. We generate revenues
and cash flows by providing our customers with freight delivery
services in both our regional area and throughout the United
States, Mexico and Canada through connections with our
affiliates and other Class I rail carriers. Our customers
conduct business in a number of different industries, including
electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum products,
forest products and metals, agriculture and mineral products,
automotive products and intermodal traffic. We use our cash
flows to support our operations and to invest in our
infrastructure. The rail industry is a capital-intensive
industry and our capital expenditures are a significant use of
cash each year. In 2004, KCSR capital expenditures were
approximately $117 million. KCSR projects 2005 capital
expenditures of $144 million, which includes funds for the
purchase of locomotives to be acquired from the Electro-Motive
Division of General Motors in the fourth quarter of 2005. A more
detailed discussion of capital expenditures is found in the
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

Grupo TFM is an unconsolidated affiliate and we use the equity
accounting method to recognize our proportionate share of Grupo
TFM’s earnings. As further described below in “Recent
Developments,” on April 20, 2003, KCS entered into an
agreement with Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”) and other
parties (the “Original Acquisition Agreement”) to
ultimately acquire control of TFM through the purchase of
TMM’s shares of Grupo TFM (the “Acquisition”).
The Original Acquisition Agreement was not consummated due to
disputes arising between the parties which led to litigation and
arbitration. On December 15, 2004, KCS and



TMM entered into an amended and restated acquisition agreement,
referred to as the “Acquisition Agreement,” amending
and restating the Original Acquisition Agreement. Under the
Acquisition Agreement, KCS will acquire control of TFM and all
of the shares of stock with full voting rights of TFM. We
anticipate closing this transaction in late March or early April
of 2005.

2004 Analysis

For 2004, KCS continued to experience consolidated revenue
growth with an increase of 10% over 2003. For the year, we
experienced revenue growth in all commodity groups except coal.
For the fourth quarter, all commodity groups experienced revenue
growth over the fourth quarter of 2003. This revenue growth was
the result of continued growth in traffic volume, especially for
Mexican traffic. Management believes much of this growth in
traffic volume is a direct result of improvements in the North
American economy and continued high levels of operating
performance and service evidenced by low terminal dwell times
and high average train velocity. Additionally, revenue increases
also reflect targeted rate increases and variable fuel
surcharges.

Operational improvements and increases in efficiency have
yielded reductions in equipment costs as foreign cars spend less
time on KCSR’s lines. Equipment costs have also been
reduced through credits resulting from KCSR equipment spending
more time on foreign lines as a result of congestion on foreign
lines. Depreciation expense declined in 2004, primarily as a
result of the implementation of new depreciation rates derived
from a study conducted on track structure and rolling stock
usage by a professional engineering firm specializing in railway
engineering applications. These improvements in operating
expense were more than offset by increases in compensation and
benefits expense (driven by increases in wage and salary rates
as well as increased crew starts related to increased traffic),
and fuel costs (related to fuel price increases and increased
consumption).

Equity in net earnings from Grupo TFM for 2004 declined
$14.7 million resulting in equity in net losses from Grupo
TFM of $2.4 million. This decline resulted from reduced
operating income of $1.2 million primarily related to
increased fuel costs and a $56.2 million increase in the
provision for income taxes. See Note 3 to the financial
statements in Item 8 to this Form 10-K. The
significant increase in the tax provision is due primarily to a
reduction in the Mexican corporate tax rate and corresponding
reductions in the value of certain tax assets previously
recorded by Grupo TFM. These reductions in the corporate tax
rates are expected to reduce future tax expense and thereby
result in increases to future earnings.

2005 Outlook

For 2005, we expect to build on the momentum and gains achieved
in 2004 by taking advantage of continued improvements in the
North American economy and our domestic operations. On
December 15, 2004, KCS and TMM announced the signing of the
Acquisition Agreement, which, upon closing, will result in
KCS’s control of TFM. We expect to close the transaction on
April 1, 2005. Combining KCSR, TFM and Tex-Mex under the
common control of KCS is expected to make us a stronger, more
competitive railway network. Upon closing of the transaction,
the financial results of TFM will be consolidated into KCS. As a
result, factors that affect the Mexican economy and business
climate, such as foreign exchange rates, tax laws and inflation
will directly impact the consolidated results of KCS. Due to
their variability, we are unable to predict the impact of such
factors on KCS’s consolidated results.

In 2005, revenues are expected to increase as an improving
economy continues to drive higher demand. With certain
exceptions, we expect increases in variable operating expenses
to be proportionate to revenue activities. Gains in operating
efficiencies are expected to continue to be realized as a result
of continued utilization of the data available from our
transportation operating system, Management Control System
(“MCS”). Fuel prices are expected to fluctuate with
market conditions and will continue to be a significant dynamic
in our operating expenses. For 2005, we currently have 4% of our
projected fuel usage hedged through fuel swaps. In 2005, we
expect fuel surcharges to continue to provide the most effective
hedge against fuel price volatility. In 2004, we began
purchasing a significant amount of our fuel through a pipeline
system, which has resulted in fuel cost savings as well as fuel
source stability. Insurance costs are expected to increase
commensurate with market conditions.



RISK FACTORS

The Company Faces Competition from Other Railroads and
Other Transportation Providers.

The Company is subject
to competition from other railroads, many of which are much
larger and have significantly greater financial and other
resources. In addition, the Company is subject to competition
from truck carriers and from barge lines and other maritime
shipping. Increased competition has resulted in downward
pressure on freight rates. Competition with other railroads and
other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates
charged, the quality and reliability of the service provided and
the quality of the carrier’s equipment for certain
commodities. While the Company must build or acquire and
maintain its infrastructure, truck carriers and maritime
shippers and barges are able to use public rights-of-way.
Continuing competitive pressures and declining margins, future
improvements that increase the service quality of alternative
modes of transportation in the locations in which the Company
operates, or legislation that provides motor carriers with
additional advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and
less weight restrictions, could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity.

The Company may be required to make additional investments
in TFM.

The Mexican government has put rights with
respect to the shares of TFM it holds to compel the purchase of
those shares by Grupo TFM. The Mexican government provided Grupo
TFM with notice of its intention to sell its interest in TFM.
Grupo TFM has responded to the Mexican government’s notice
reaffirming its right and interest in purchasing the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM, but also advising
the Mexican government that it would not take any action until
its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment was resolved. Grupo
TFM filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment concerning
its interpretation of its obligation to purchase the Mexican
government’s shares of TFM, and that lawsuit is ongoing.
KCS and TMM have been made parties to the lawsuit. In the event
that Grupo TFM does not purchase the Mexican government’s
20% interest in TFM and Grupo TFM’s lawsuit is resolved in
favor of the Mexican government, then TMM and KCS, or either of
TMM or KCS alone, would, following notification by the Mexican
government in accordance with the terms of the applicable
agreements, be obligated to purchase the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM. If the Acquisition
is completed prior to the purchase of the Mexican
government’s interest in TFM, KCS will be solely
responsible for purchasing the Mexican government’s 20%
interest in TFM. If KCS had been required to purchase this
interest as of December 31, 2004, the total purchase price
would have been approximately $468 million.

We may be unable to complete the Acquisition.

KCS
and TMM have entered into the Acquisition Agreement dated
December 15, 2004. This agreement is subject to completion
of closing on April 1, 2005. If the Acquisition is not
consummated, the value of our investment in Grupo TFM may become
impaired.

If the Mexican government’s preliminary findings and
conclusions arising from its tax audit of TFM’s 1997 tax
returns are sustained, it could have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition, results of operations and business
of TFM. As a result, the value of our investment in Grupo TFM
could be materially adversely affected.

On
January 20, 2004, TFM was served with an official letter
notifying TFM of the Mexican government’s preliminary
findings and conclusions arising from its tax audit of
TFM’s 1997 tax returns (the “Tax Audit Summary”).
In the Tax Audit Summary, the Mexican government notified TFM of
its preliminary conclusion that the documentation provided by
TFM in support of the VAT refund credit shown on the 1997 tax
return and TFM’s basis in the Concession title, locomotives
and rail equipment, and capital leases purchased by TFM’s
predecessor in interest prior to Grupo TFM’s purchase of
80% of the shares of TFM, do not comply with the formalities
required by the applicable tax legislation. On March 16,
2005, TFM was notified by the Mexican Fiscal Administration
Service (

“Servicio de Administración
Tributaria”

or the

“SAT”

) that it had
finished its audit of TFM’s 1997 tax returns. As of
March 16, 2005. The SAT had not yet assessed any penalties
or taxes against TFM as a result of the audit. In the notice,
the SAT stated that TFM did not supply documentation complying
with the requirements of the Mexican fiscal code and, therefore,
it was not entitled in its 1997 tax returns to depreciate and
deduct the concession title, the railway equipment and other
assets that were assets of TFM at the time that it was
privatized in 1997. If sustained, the SAT’s conclusions
would prevent TFM from depreciating for Mexican tax purposes the
Concession title, locomotives



and rail equipment, and capital leases, which represent the
majority of the value of the assets owned by TFM. If TFM is
unable to depreciate the Concession title and the other assets
reported on its 1997 tax return for Mexican tax purposes, this
could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
results of operations and business of TFM. As a result, the
value of our investment in Grupo TFM could be materially
adversely impacted.

We may not receive the proceeds specified by the VAT
Refund Claim.

On January  19, 2004, TFM
received a Special Certificate from the Mexican Federal Treasury
in the amount of 2.1 billion pesos (the same amount as the
value added tax (“VAT”) refund claimed by TFM in
1997). The Mexican government also attached the Special
Certificate pending resolution of the audit, as a potential
asset to be used to satisfy any tax obligations owed by TFM as a
result of the audit. TFM has advised that it has, within the
time allowed by the Tax Audit Summary, contested the conclusions
of the Mexican tax authorities, and it has filed a
constitutional appeal against the Tax Audit Summary, alleging
the process followed by the Mexican government violated
TFM’s constitutional rights. TFM also filed a complaint
against the Mexican government, seeking to have the amount of
the Special Certificate adjusted to reflect interest and
inflation from 1997 to the date of issuance in accordance with
Mexican law. In a decision dated November 24, 2004, the
Mexican Federal Appellate Court issued a decision upholding
TFM’s claim that it is entitled to inflation and interest
on the VAT refund. The Federal Appellate Court remanded the case
to the Mexican Fiscal Court with instructions to enter a new
order consistent with this decision. On January 26, 2005,
the Mexican Fiscal Court issued from the bench an oral order
implementing the Appellate Court decisions. This order was
delivered to TFM in written form on February 18, 2005.
There can be no assurance that we will receive the proceeds
specified by the VAT refund claim.

Our business strategy, operations and growth rely
significantly on joint ventures and other strategic
alliances.

Operation of our integrated rail network and
our plans for growth and expansion rely significantly on joint
ventures and other strategic alliances. Unless the Acquisition
is consummated, we will continue to hold an indirect minority
interest in TFM. As a minority shareholder, we are not in a
position to control operations, strategies or financial
decisions without the concurrence of TMM, the largest
shareholder in Grupo TFM. In addition, our operations are
dependent on interchange, trackage rights, haulage rights and
marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that
enable us to exchange traffic and utilize trackage we do not
own. Our ability to provide comprehensive rail service to our
customers depends in large part upon our ability to maintain
these agreements with other railroads and third parties. The
termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. We are also dependent in part upon the financial
health and efficient performance of other railroads. There can
be no assurance that we will not be materially affected
adversely by operational or financial difficulties of other
railroads.

Our Mexican and Panamanian investments subject us to
political and economic risks.

Our investment in Grupo
TFM involves a number of risks. The Mexican government exercises
significant influence over the Mexican economy and its actions
could have a significant impact on TFM. Our Mexican investment
may also be adversely affected by currency fluctuations, price
instability, inflation, interest rates, regulations, taxation,
cultural differences, social instability, labor disputes and
other political, social and economic developments in or
affecting Mexico. Moreover, TFM’s commercial success is
heavily dependent on expected increases in U.S.-Mexico trade and
will be strongly influenced by the effect of NAFTA on such
trade. Downturns in either of the U.S. or Mexican economies
or in trade between the United States and Mexico would likely
adversely impact TFM’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. Additionally, the Mexican government may
revoke the exclusivity of TFM’s Concession after
20 years if it determines that there is insufficient
competition and may terminate the Concession as a result of
certain conditions or events. TFM’s assets and its rights
under the Concession may also be seized temporarily by the
Mexican government. Revocation or termination of the Concession
would materially adversely affect TFM’s operations and its
ability to make payments on its debt. Our investment in PCRC has
risks associated with operating in Panama, including, among
others, cultural differences, varying labor and operating
practices, political risk and differences between the U.S. and
Panamanian economies. There can be no assurances that the
various risks associated with



operating in Mexico can be effectively and economically
mitigated by TFM or that the risks associated with operating in
Panama can be effectively and economically mitigated by PCRC.

Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to fulfill
obligations under various debt instruments and operate our
business. KCS is leveraged and will have significant debt
service obligations. In addition, TFM is also leveraged and the
acquisition of a controlling interest in TFM would increase our
consolidated indebtedness and leverage.

Our level of
debt could make it more difficult to borrow money in the future,
reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations
and other business activities, expose KCS to the risk of
increased interest rates, make KCS more vulnerable to general
economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, reduce the
flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing business
and economic conditions, and prevent us from raising the funds
necessary to repurchase all of certain senior notes that could
be tendered upon the occurrence of a change of control, which
would constitute an event of default, or all of the Convertible
Preferred Stock that could be put to KCS under certain
circumstances. Our failure to comply with the financial and
other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, which,
among other things, require KCS to maintain specified financial
ratios and limit our ability to incur additional debt and sell
assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured
or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business
or prospects. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt,
meet other obligations and fund other liquidity needs, we may be
required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital
expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all
or part of our existing debt or seeking additional equity
capital. We cannot assure that any of these remedies can be
effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In
addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may
restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives.

We may be adversely affected by changes in general
economic, weather or other conditions.

KCS’s
operations may be adversely affected by changes in the economic
conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce
and consume the freight that KCS transports. The relative
strength or weakness of the U.S. economy as well as various
international and regional economies also affects the businesses
served. TFM and PCRC are more directly affected by their
respective local economies. Historically, a stronger economy has
resulted in improved results for rail transportation operations.
Conversely, when the economy has slowed, results have been less
favorable. Our revenues may be affected by prevailing economic
conditions and, if an economic slowdown or recession occurs in
our key markets, the volume of rail shipments is likely to be
reduced. Additionally, our operations may be affected by adverse
weather conditions, which may, for example, substantially reduce
the volume of business handled for agricultural products
customers. Additionally, many of the goods and commodities we
transport experience cyclical demand. Our results of operations
can be expected to reflect this cyclical demand because of the
significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations. Our
operations may also be affected by natural disasters or
terrorist acts. Significant reductions in our volume of rail
shipments due to economic, weather or other conditions could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are Subject to Governmental Regulation.

We are
subject to governmental regulation by federal, state and local
regulatory agencies with respect to our railroad operations, as
well as a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and
other matters. Government regulation of the railroad industry is
a significant determinant of the competitiveness and
profitability of railroads. Our failure to comply with
applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse
effect on our operations, including limitations on our operating
activities until compliance with applicable requirements is
completed. These government agencies may change the legislative
or regulatory framework within which we operate without
providing any recourse for any adverse effects on our business
that occur as a result of this change. Additionally, some of the
regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses,
permits and other authorizations, and we cannot assure that we
will continue to be able to do so.

We are Subject to Environmental Laws and
Regulations.

Our operations are subject to extensive
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges
to waters, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of
waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or
petroleum releases, decommissioning of underground storage tanks
and soil and groundwater contamination. We incur, and expect to
continue to incur, environmental compliance costs, including, in
particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance with
requirements governing chemical and



hazardous material shipping operations, refueling operations and
repair facilities. New laws and regulations, stricter
enforcement of existing requirements, new spills, releases or
violations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination
could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or
increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

We are Vulnerable to Rising Fuel Costs or Disruptions in
Fuel Supplies.

We incur substantial fuel costs in our
operations and these costs represent a significant portion of
our transportation expenses. Fuel costs are affected by traffic
levels, efficiency of operations and equipment, and petroleum
market conditions. The supply and cost of fuel is subject to
market conditions and is influenced by numerous factors beyond
our control, including general economic conditions, world
markets, government programs and regulations and competition.
Significant price increases may have a material adverse effect
on our operating results. Additionally, fuel prices and supplies
could also be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or
by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing
regulations. In the event of a severe disruption of fuel
supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a
disruption of oil imports, war or otherwise, the resulting
impact on fuel prices could materially adversely affect our
operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

A Majority of Our Employees Belong to Labor Unions, and
Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our
Operations.

We are a party to collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions in the United States.
Approximately 83% of KCSR employees are covered under these
agreements. We may be subject to, among other things, strikes,
work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of disputes with
regard to the terms of these collective bargaining agreements or
our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with
these unions. Moreover, because such agreements are generally
negotiated on an industry-wide basis, determination of the terms
and conditions of future labor agreements could be beyond our
control and, as a result, we may be subject to terms and
conditions in amended or future labor agreements that could have
a material adverse affect on our results of operations,
financial position and cash flows. If the unionized workers were
to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, or other
employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions
in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could
experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher
ongoing labor costs.

Loss of our largest coal customer could have a material
effect on our operations.

Our largest coal customer
accounted for approximately 56.1% of our coal revenues and
approximately 8.1% of our total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The loss of all or a significant part of
this business, or a service outage at one of the facilities that
KCSR serves, could materially adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits.

The nature of the railroad business exposes us to the potential
for various claims and litigation related to labor and
employment, personal injury and property damage, environmental
and other matters. We maintain insurance (including
self-insurance) consistent with the industry practice against
accident-related risks involved in the operation of the
railroad. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance
would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages suffered or
that such insurance will continue to be available at
commercially reasonable rates. Any material changes to current
litigation trends could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We May Be Affected by Future Acts of Terrorism or
War.

Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on
September 11, 2001, any government response thereto and war
or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition, and cash flows. These acts may also impact
our ability to raise capital or our future business
opportunities. Our rail lines and facilities could be direct
targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror,
which could cause significant business interruption and result
in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. These
acts could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition,
insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage
currently maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or
certain coverage may not be available in the future.



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

KCS and Janus Capital Group Finalize Settlement Agreement
and Mutual General Release.

On October 15, 2004 KCS
and Janus Capital Group Inc., formerly Stilwell Financial Inc.
(“Janus or Stilwell”), finalized the Settlement
Agreement and Mutual General Release (“Release”) (see
Note 9 in the Notes to KCS’s Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The terms of
the Release effect settlement of all disputes that arose on or
before August 13, 2004 relating to the spin-off of Janus
from KCS on July 12, 2000. As part of the settlement, all
arbitration claims filed by the parties with the American
Arbitration Association were dismissed. Consistent with the
disclosures in the KCS 2003 Form 10-K, this settlement
results in no adverse financial consequences to KCS.

KCS adds New Director.

On July 26, 2004, we
announced that Robert J. Druten had been elected to our Board of
Directors. Mr. Druten currently serves as Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Hallmark Cards, Inc.,
the world’s largest publisher of greeting cards and related
products. He serves on that company’s corporate executive
council. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Crown
Media Holdings, Inc. In addition, Mr. Druten is the
Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Entertainment Properties
Trust and a member of the Board of Directors of BHA Group, Inc.
On September 28, 2004, Mr. Druten was appointed as a
member and chairman of KCS’s audit committee.

Amended 2004 Senior Secured Credit Facility.

During March 2004, we used cash on-hand to repay approximately
$98.5 million relating to our former credit facility. On
March 30, 2004, we concluded a new credit facility
(“2004 Credit Facility.”) The 2004 Credit Facility
consisted of a $100 million revolving credit facility
(“2004 Revolving Credit Facility”) maturing on
March 30, 2007 and a $150 million Term B loan facility
(“Term B Loan Facility”) maturing on
March 30, 2008. The Term B Loan Facility was fully
funded on the closing date and the proceeds are expected to be,
or have been, used to pay transaction costs, and for other
general corporate purposes, including additional investments in
the Company’s Mexican affiliates. There are no funds drawn
under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31,
2004, and the full $100 million borrowing capacity is
currently available to KCS. Up to $25 million of the 2004
Revolving Credit Facility is available for letters of credit and
up to $15 million is available for swing line loans. The
proceeds from future borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit
Facility may be used for working capital and for general
corporate purposes, including additional investments in our
Mexican affiliates. The letters of credit may be used for
general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2004 Credit
Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company’s
assets and are guaranteed by the majority of its subsidiaries.

On December 22, 2004, we entered into an amendment and
waiver of the 2004 Credit Facility (the “Amended 2004
Credit Facility”). The credit agreement was amended to,
among other things, increase the term loan by $100 million
to a total amount outstanding at December 31, 2004 of
$249,250,000 and decrease the borrowing spread by 25 basis
points to 175 basis points over LIBOR. In addition, a
waiver was granted that would allow KCSR to make an additional
$55 million of capital expenditures during 2004 and 2005.
The maturity date of the credit agreement was unchanged. For
additional information regarding the new credit facility, see
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements under
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

KCS and TMM Enter Into Acquisition Agreement.

On
December 15, 2004, we entered into the Acquisition
Agreement with TMM and other parties under which KCS ultimately
would acquire control of TFM through the purchase of shares of
common stock of Grupo TFM. Grupo TFM holds an 80% economic
interest in TFM and all of the shares of stock with full voting
rights of TFM. The remaining 20% economic interest in TFM is
owned by the Mexican government in the form of shares with
limited voting rights. The Mexican government has put rights
with respect to its TFM shares as discussed below. The
obligations of KCS and TMM to complete the Acquisition are
subject to a number of conditions. On March 29, 2005, at a
special meeting of the KCS shareholders approval of the
acquisition as described above was received. Closing on the
acquisition is expected to occur on April 1, 2005. For
additional discussion of the terms of the Acquisition Agreement,
see Note 3 in the Notes to KCS’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The purpose of the Acquisition is to place TFM under the control
of KCS, which will also control KCSR, Tex-Mex and Gateway
Eastern. Management believes that common control of these
railroads, which are



already physically linked in an end-to-end configuration, will
enhance competition and give shippers in the NAFTA trade
corridor a strong transportation alternative as they make their
decisions to move goods between the United States, Mexico and
Canada.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS would acquire
all of the interest of TMM in Grupo TFM for $200.0 million
in cash, 18 million shares of KCS common stock and
promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$47.0 million to be deposited in an escrow account and
held, reduced and released in accordance with the terms of an
escrow agreement (see Note 3 in the Notes to KCS’s
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
Form 10-K). In addition, upon the successful resolution of
both the VAT refund claim and the Mexican Government’s Put
(defined below), KCS will be obligated to pay to TMM an
additional amount of up to $110 million payable in a
combination of cash and KCS common stock. We anticipate that we
would pay the cash portion of the purchase price using a
combination of existing cash assets and proceeds from the
Amended 2004 Credit Facility as further described above in
“Amended 2004 Senior Secured Credit Facility.”

In connection with the Acquisition, KCS has entered into a
consulting agreement, to become effective upon the closing of
the Acquisition (the “Consulting Agreement”), with
José F. Serrano International Business, S.A. de C.V., a
consulting company controlled by Jose Serrano, Chairman of the
Board of TMM, Grupo TFM and TFM, pursuant to which it would
provide consulting services to KCS in connection with the
portion of the business of KCS in Mexico for a period of three
years. As consideration for these services, the consulting
company would receive an annual fee of $3 million and an
additional $9 million upon satisfactory resolution of all
issues related to the VAT Claim and the Mexican
Government’s Put. The Consulting Agreement requires KCS to
deposit the total amount of annual fee payable under the
Consulting Agreement ($9 million) in an escrow account to
be held and released in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Consulting Agreement and the applicable escrow agreement.

On October 6, 2004, Mexico’s Foreign Investment
Commission (“FIC”) notified KCS of its approval of our
application for authority to acquire TMM’s interest in TFM.
This approval is necessary for a foreign company to become a
majority owner of a Mexican railway company and remains valid
until October 5, 2005. KCS’s notification with respect
to the acquisition of the Grupo TFM shares was filed with the
Mexican Competition Commission on April 21, 2003. KCS
received formal written notice that the Mexican Competition
Commission (“MCC” or the “Competition
Commission”) had approved the proposed consolidation,
without conditions. Through a series of extensions received from
the MCC, KCS’s authority to purchase TMM’s interest in
TFM remains valid through April 5, 2005. On
January 25, 2005, the 30-day waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(“HSR”) expired without a formal request from the
U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for additional
information of documentary material. This will allow KCS and TMM
to complete the transaction without an antitrust challenge from
the DOJ. With the extension of the Competition Commission
approval, approval from the Mexican Foreign Investment
Commission and completion of the HSR process, our shareholder
approval of the issuance of the shares required under the
Acquisition Agreement was the final condition precedent to
completion of the proposed Acquisition. On March 29, 2005,
at a special meeting of the KCS shareholders approval of the
acquisition as described above was received. Closing on the
acquisition is expected to occur on April 1, 2005.

Mexican Government’s Put Rights With Respect to TFM
Stock.

Under the terms of the January 31,
1997 share purchase agreement through which Grupo TFM
agreed to purchase the shares of TFM, as amended by the parties
on June 9, 1997 (the “TFM Share Purchase
Agreement”), the Mexican government has the right to compel
the purchase of its 20% interest in TFM (referred to as the
“Put”) by Grupo TFM following its compliance with the
terms and conditions of the TFM Share Purchase Agreement. Upon
exercise of the Put in accordance with the terms of the TFM
Share Purchase Agreement, Grupo TFM would be obligated to
purchase the TFM capital stock at the initial share price paid
by Grupo TFM adjusted for interest and inflation. Prior to
October 30, 2003, Grupo TFM filed suit in the Federal
District Court of Mexico City seeking, among other things, a
declaratory judgment interpreting whether Grupo TFM was
obligated to honor its obligation under the TFM Share Purchase
Agreement, as the Mexican government had not made any effort to
sell the TFM shares subject to the Put prior to October 31,
2003. In its suit, Grupo TFM named TMM and KCS as additional
interested parties. The Mexican Court has admitted Grupo
TFM’s complaint



and issued an injunction that blocked the Mexican government
from exercising the Put. The Mexican government provided Grupo
TFM with notice of its intention to sell its interest in TFM on
October 30, 2003. Grupo TFM has responded to the Mexican
government’s notice reaffirming its right and interest in
purchasing the Mexican government’s remaining interest in
TFM, but also advising the Mexican government that it would not
take any action until its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment
was resolved. In the event that Grupo TFM does not purchase the
Mexican government’s 20% interest in TFM, TMM and KCS, or
either of TMM or KCS alone, would, following notification by the
Mexican government in accordance with the terms of the TFM Share
Purchase Agreement, be obligated to purchase the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM. As this matter is
currently the subject of litigation in Mexico to which the
Mexican government, Grupo TFM, TMM and KCS are parties, KCS
management does not believe it is likely that the Mexican
government will seek to exercise the Put until the litigation is
resolved. On completion of the Acquisition, KCS will assume
TMM’s rights and obligations with respect to the TFM shares
subject to the Put and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates,
and their respective officers, directors, employees and
shareholders, against obligations or liabilities relating
thereto. If KCS had been required to purchase this interest as
of December 31, 2004, the total purchase price would have
been approximately $468 million.

Value Added Tax Lawsuit and VAT Contingency Payment under
the Acquisition Agreement.

The VAT lawsuit (“VAT
Claim”) arose out of the Mexican Treasury’s delivery
of a VAT credit certificate to a Mexican governmental agency
rather than to TFM in 1997. The face value of the VAT credit at
issue is 2,111,111,790 pesos or approximately $189 million
in U.S. dollars, based on current exchange rates. The
amount of the VAT refund will, in accordance with Mexican law,
reflect the face value of the VAT credit adjusted for inflation
and interest from 1997.

After several Mexican Fiscal Court and Mexican appellate court
rulings during 2002 and 2003, on January 19, 2004, TFM
received a Special Certificate from the Mexican Federal Treasury
in the amount of 2.1 billion pesos. The Special Certificate
delivered to TFM on January 19, 2004 has the same face
amount as the original VAT refund claimed by TFM in 1997. TFM
also filed a complaint against the Mexican government, seeking
to have the amount of the Special Certificate adjusted to
reflect interest and inflation in accordance with Mexican law.
The Mexican Fiscal Court initially denied TFM’s claim. In a
decision dated November 24, 2004, the Mexican Federal
Appellate Court upheld TFM’s claim that it is entitled to
inflation and interest from 1997 on the VAT refund. The Federal
Appellate Court remanded the case to the Mexican Fiscal Court
with instructions to enter a new order consistent with this
decision. On January 26, 2005, the Mexican Fiscal Court
issued from the bench an oral order implementing the Appellate
Court decision. On February 18, 2005, TFM was served with
the written order from the Mexican Fiscal Court.

In conjunction with the Acquisition Agreement, in the event of
the Final Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put (as such term is
defined in the Acquisition Agreement), KCS will be obligated to
pay to TMM an additional amount (referred to as the “VAT
Contingency Payment”) of up to $110 million payable in
a combination of cash and KCS common stock. If the Acquisition
is completed, KCS will assume TMM’s obligations to make any
payment upon the successful exercise by the Mexican government
of the Put and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees and shareholders,
against obligations or liabilities relating thereto.

1997 Tax Audit Summary.

TFM was served on
January 20, 2004 with an official letter notifying TFM of
the Mexican government’s preliminary findings and
conclusions arising from its tax audit of TFM’s 1997 tax
returns (“Tax Audit Summary”). In the Tax Audit
Summary, the Mexican government notified TFM of its preliminary
conclusion that the documentation provided by TFM in support of
the VAT refund claim and depreciation of the TFM Concession
title and the assets reported on TFM’s 1997 tax return do
not comply with the formalities required by the applicable tax
legislation. In addition, the Mexican government attached the
Special Certificate pending resolution of the audit. TFM has
advised that it has, within the time allowed by the Tax Audit
Summary, contested the conclusions of the Mexican tax
authorities, and it has filed a constitutional appeal against
the Tax Audit Summary, alleging the process followed by the
Mexican government violated TFM’s constitutional rights. On
March 16, 2005, TFM was notified by the Mexican Fiscal
Administration Service (

“Servicio de Administración
Tributaria”

or the

“SAT”

) that it had
finished its audit of TFM’s 1997 tax returns. As of
March 16, 2005. The SAT had not yet assessed any penalties
or taxes



against TFM as a result of the audit. In the notice, the SAT
stated that TFM did not supply documentation complying with the
requirements of the Mexican fiscal code and, therefore, it was
not entitled in its 1997 tax returns to depreciate and deduct
the concession title, the railway equipment and other assets
that were assets of TFM at the time that it was privatized in
1997. KCS and TMM continue discussions with the Mexican
government to resolve the outstanding disputes between the
parties.

Repurchase of Mexrail Shares by KCS.

KCS, TMM and
TFM entered into a new Stock Purchase Agreement dated
August 16, 2004 (“New Mexrail Stock Purchase
Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, KCS
purchased from TFM 51% of the outstanding shares of Mexrail, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of TFM, for $32.7 million and
placed those shares into trust pending STB approval to exercise
common control over KCSR, Gateway Eastern and Tex-Mex. Pending
the STB’s approval, equity in net earnings (losses) of
unconsolidated affiliates of $2.7 million was recognized
representing our 51% share of Mexrail’s losses for the
period from August 16, 2004 through December 31, 2004.
We expect to complete an evaluation of the fair value of the
assets and liabilities of Mexrail in the first quarter of 2005.
The terms of the New Mexrail Stock Purchase Agreement are
substantially similar to the May 9, 2003 Stock Purchase
Agreement, but TFM does not have any right to repurchase the
Mexrail shares sold to KCS and KCS has an option which, if not
exercised on or before October 31, 2005, becomes an
obligation on October 31, 2005, to purchase the remaining
shares of Mexrail owned by TFM at a price of $31.4 million.
On November 29, 2004, the STB approved our application for
authority to control KCSR, Gateway Eastern and Tex-Mex which
approval became effective on December 29, 2004. The shares
representing 51% ownership of Mexrail were transferred by the
trustee to KCS on January 1, 2005.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Net Income.

Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2004 increased $12.2 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase of
$54.4 million in operating income was partially offset by a
net decrease in other nonoperating income and expense items of
$6.9 million, a $26.4 million increase in the
provision for income taxes, and the impact of an
$8.9 million cumulative effect of accounting change, net of
income taxes in the first quarter of 2003.



The following table summarizes the income statement components
of KCS

(in millions):

nm — not meaningful percentage change in excess of 500%

The following table summarizes consolidated KCS revenues,
including the revenues and carload statistics of KCSR, for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in the
business groups and to conform to the current period
presentation.

Revenues.

For the year ended December 31, 2004,
consolidated revenues increased $58.2 million. Freight
revenues included fuel surcharges of

$

16.7 million
compared with $4.4 million in the prior year. Fuel
surcharges will increase or decrease dependent on the price of
West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil as published in the Wall
Street Journal. KCSR experienced revenue increases in the
chemical and petroleum, forest products and metals, and
agriculture and mineral products, and intermodal commodity
groups while



coal revenues were relatively flat. For most commodity groups,
these increases in revenue resulted from higher carloadings and
targeted price improvements. The following discussion provides
an analysis of KCSR revenues by commodity group.

Chemical and petroleum products.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCSR recorded higher revenues for all
commodities within the chemical and petroleum products group.
Revenue increases for petroleum, agricultural chemicals and
industrial gases were primarily the result of targeted rate
increases as well as increased traffic volumes. While some new
business was added in 2004, increased volumes from existing
customers driven by improvements in the economy accounts for the
majority of the volume change. Excluding organic chemicals,
revenue per carload (RPC) increased 6.6% over 2003. Organic
chemical revenues increased primarily as a result of increased
traffic, partially offset by lower RPC due to shorter hauls and
changes in commodity mix.

Forest products and metals.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCSR recorded higher revenues for all
forest products and metal commodities compared to 2003. Revenue
increases for all commodities in the group resulted from certain
targeted rate increases, fuel surcharges, and increased volume
attributed to higher production and service improvements.
Volumes for lumber and plywood products experienced growth as a
result of a robust housing industry and hurricane reconstruction
in Florida. Wet weather in other areas of the country
contributed to a rise in traffic for pulpwood, logs and chip.
Military and other carloads increased due to strong traffic
during the second half of 2004 as a result of increased
movements for military installations serviced by KCSR.

Agricultural and mineral products.

Revenues in all
commodities in the agricultural business unit increased due to
targeted rate increases and fuel surcharges resulting in an
overall RPC increase of 8.5%. Carload volumes increased in all
commodities except for food and kindred. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, increases in revenues for domestic grain
were a direct result of increased production of feed mills on
KCSR’s line. Export grain revenues for 2004 versus 2003
improved as a result of increased volumes related to the
shipment of current year grain harvests to ports in the Gulf of
Mexico, combined with strong increases in export volumes to
Mexico. Ores and minerals revenue and stone, clay and glass
revenues increased during 2004 as a result of higher production
by certain customers, as well as certain targeted rate increases
and fuel surcharges. Food and kindred product revenues increased
primarily as a result of longer hauls to domestic destinations.

Intermodal and automotive.

Intermodal revenues increased
as a result of higher volumes from existing customers, as well
as the generation of new intermodal business. Automotive traffic
increased partially as a result of a temporary shift in traffic
from Ford Motor Company and increased volumes from GM and Mazda.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in haulage
revenue per car resulting from a change in the traffic mix.

Coal.

Revenues for coal for the year ended
December 31, 2004 decreased due primarily to lower traffic
volumes at certain electric generating stations. These
year-to-year decreases were partially offset by increased
traffic in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to new business,
as well increased production at other electric generating
stations.



The following table summarizes KCS’s consolidated operating
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

Operating Expenses.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, consolidated operating expenses increased
$3.8 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2003.

Compensation and Benefits.

Compensation and benefits
expense increased $15.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result
of annual wage and salary rate increases, higher crew starts
related to higher traffic volume and increased incentive
compensation. Average headcount for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was 2,740 compared to 2,676 for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Purchased Services.

Purchased services expense for the
year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $1.2 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 resulting from
lower levels of equipment repairs partially offset by increases
in infrastructure repairs performed by outside parties and
higher legal costs related to claim settlements.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased $19.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. Increases of 30.2% in average price per
gallon and 6.8% in consumption were offset in part by fuel cost
savings of $3.0 million as a result of our fuel hedging
program and improved fuel purchasing and distribution procedures
implemented through our new Heavener, Oklahoma fueling facility.
The 6.8% increase in consumption was a direct result of
increased traffic, as gallons per gross ton mile remained
unchanged from 2003 to 2004 at 1.37. Fuel cost represented
approximately 11.9% of operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to 8.6% of operating costs and
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Equipment Costs.

Equipment costs for the year ended
December 31, 2004 decreased $7.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was
primarily due to continued efficiency gains in KCSR’s rail
operations combined with an increase in car hire receivable for
KCSR rolling stock on foreign lines and the 2004 acquisition of
locomotives from Southern Capital, which were previously under
lease.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and
amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2004
decreased $10.8 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of changes in
depreciable lives and salvage values approved by the STB and
which took effect on January 1, 2004. These decreases were
partially offset by increases in the property base as a result
of capital expenditures.

Casualties and Insurance.

Casualties and insurance
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased
$14.0 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2003. Casualties and insurance expense was significantly
impacted in 2003 as a result of a $21.1 million provision
in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding this provision, the
$7.1 million increase in casualties and insurance was
primarily the result of a $5.0 million derailment in
Bolton, Mississippi in September 2004. Casualties and insurance
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the
net effect of approximately $4.4 million in insurance
settlements.



Other Leases.

Other lease expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004 increased $2.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003, related to pipeline rents
for KCSR’s new fuel facility in Heavener, Oklahoma.
Additionally, KCSR experienced normal rate increases in
long-term leases.

Operating Income.

Consolidated operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2004 increased $54.4 million
to $83.5 million compared to $29.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Accordingly, KCS experienced
a reduction in its consolidated operating ratio (ratio of
operating expenses to operating revenues) of 8.1 basis
points to 86.9% in 2004 from 95.0% in 2003. This decrease was
the result of a $58.2 million increase in revenue,
partially offset by a corresponding $3.8 million increase
in operating expenses.

Interest Expense.

Consolidated interest expense for the
year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $2.0 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. This
reduction was primarily the result of decreased balances on
higher fixed rate debt instruments and lower average interest
rates related to the 2004 Credit Facility.

Debt Retirement Costs.

During the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCS recorded $4.2 million of debt
retirement costs resulting from the write-off of the unamortized
balance of debt issuance costs associated with our previous
credit facility.

Other Income.

Increases in KCS’s other income for
the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily the result
of interest on tax refunds received in 2004 related to certain
prior year tax returns as well as fluctuations in gains on sales
of non-operating property.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit).

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCS’s income tax provision was
$23.6 million, an increase of $26.4 million compared
to a $2.8 million benefit for the year ended
December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a
$47.5 million increase in income before income taxes,
resulting in an effective income tax rate of 49.1% and (600.7)%
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The primary cause of the increase in the effective
rate was the increase in KCS pre-tax earnings, excluding equity
in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, of
$50.4 million in 2004 compared to a pre-tax loss of
$11.8 million in 2003, resulting in a consolidated
effective income tax rate of 46.8% for 2004 compared to 23.8%
for 2003. KCS intends to indefinitely reinvest the equity
earnings from Grupo TFM and accordingly, does not provide
deferred income tax expense for the excess of its book basis
over the tax basis of its investment in Grupo TFM.

Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
Affiliates.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, Grupo TFM’s operating results and KCS’s
corresponding equity in earnings under United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) were
as follows

(in millions):

)

$

KCS equity in earnings (losses) of Grupo TFM

(2.4

)

$

The increase in Grupo TFM operating expenses was driven
primarily by increases in fuel costs of $19.2 million
partially offset by decreases in other operating expenses. Net
income of Grupo TFM was significantly impacted by a
$4.7 million income tax provision (U.S. GAAP) compared
to a $51.5 million income tax benefit for 2003. This net
increase in the tax provision was largely driven by tax
legislation passed in the fourth quarter of 2004 that lowered
future corporate income tax rates in Mexico. As a result of this
legislation, the value of certain net deferred tax assets was
adjusted to reflect lower values resulting in a charge to the
tax provision of $23.7 million. Grupo TFM’s principal
deferred tax assets are the result of prior year net operating
losses for income tax purposes. Grupo TFM’s tax provision
for 2004 was also impacted by changes in the peso/dollar
exchange rate as well as adjustments for inflation within the
Mexican economy.



Grupo TFM reports its financial results under International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Because we are
required to report our equity in net earnings in Grupo TFM under
U.S. GAAP and Grupo TFM reports under IFRS, differences in
deferred income tax calculations and the classification of
certain operating expense categories occur. The deferred income
tax calculations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in
the relative value of the Mexican peso versus the
U.S. dollar and the rate of Mexican inflation, and can
result in significant variability in the amount of equity
earnings reported by KCS. Additionally, in 2004, TFM recognized
a loss, net of tax and minority interest, of $4.2 million
on the sale of its interest in Mexrail to KCS. For purposes of
recording our equity in the net losses of Grupo TFM, this loss
was eliminated due to the sale being to KCS, a related party.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, equity in losses from
other unconsolidated affiliates was $2.1 million compared
to equity in losses from other unconsolidated affiliates of
$1.3 million in 2003. Significant components of this change
were as follows:

•

For 2004, KCS recorded equity in losses of $2.1 million
    from PCRC compared to $3.1 million for 2003 as PCRC
    continues to operate below full capacity due to delays in the
    completion of port expansion in Balboa.

•

Equity in losses of $2.7 million from KCS’s investment
    in Mexrail. For 2003 and the first half of 2004, Mexrail’s
    results were consolidated into the results of Grupo TFM.

•

Equity in earnings from Southern Capital of $2.7 million
    compared to $1.8 million in 2003.

For 2004, earnings for Southern Capital were $11.8 million
compared to $4.1 million in 2003. This increase of
$7.7 million was primarily the result of the recognition by
Southern Capital of an approximate $6.0 million gain
related to the sale of locomotives to KCSR in the second quarter
of 2004. For purposes of recording its share of Southern Capital
earnings, the Company has recorded its share of the gain as a
reduction to the cost basis of the equipment acquired. As a
result, the Company will recognize its equity in the gain over
the remaining depreciable life of the locomotives as a reduction
of depreciation expense.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change.

The Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (“SFAS 143”) effective
January 1, 2003. As a result, the Company changed its
method of accounting for removal costs of certain track
structure assets and recorded a one-time benefit of
$8.9 million (net of income taxes of $5.6 million)
during the first quarter of 2003. This change is reported as a
cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying
consolidated statement of income.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

Net Income.

Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2003 decreased $45.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease resulted
from a $33.5 million decrease in equity in earnings of
Grupo TFM, a $34.0 million increase in operating expenses
(mostly related to increases in casualty and fuel expenses as
discussed further below), a $10.8 million decline in other
income and a $1.4 million increase in interest expense.
Also contributing to the comparably lower 2003 net income
was the impact of a $4.4 million gain on the sale of
Mexrail recorded in 2002. These factors were partially offset by
a $15.1 million increase in revenue, a $9.7 million
decrease in the provision for income taxes, a benefit of
$8.9 million (net of income taxes of $5.6 million)
reported during 2003 relating to the cumulative effect of an
accounting change, the effect of $4.3 million in debt
retirement costs reported in 2002 and a $1.1 million
improvement in the equity in net losses of other unconsolidated
affiliates (PCRC and Southern Capital).



The following table summarizes the income statement components
of KCS

(in millions):

The following table summarizes consolidated KCS revenues,
including the revenues and carload statistics of KCSR, for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in the
business groups and to conform to the current period
presentation.

Revenues.

For the year ended December 31, 2003,
consolidated revenues increased $15.1 million. KCSR
experienced revenue increases in forest products and metals,
agriculture and mineral and intermodal commodity groups as well
as higher revenues for extra services (haulage, switching, and
demurrage). These revenue increases were partially offset by
revenue declines in coal, chemical and petroleum products and
automotive traffic. During the second half of 2002, operations
were slowed by the implementation of MCS, contributing to a
decline in 2002 revenues. In 2003, most of the slowdown, which
resulted from the implementation of MCS, had been reversed and
KCSR began to realize the benefits of more and better



quality data in the form of additional extra service revenues.
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 included
approximately $3.6 million related to reductions of certain
allowances and reserves based upon revised estimates. Revenue
from other subsidiaries increased approximately
$1.5 million year over year primarily due to volume
increases at the Company’s bulk petroleum coke facility and
higher sales to third parties at the Company’s wood tie
treating facility. These increases were partially offset by a
reduction of other revenues due to the sale of the Wyandotte
Garage Corporation (“WGC”) during August 2002. The
following discussion provides an analysis of KCSR revenues by
commodity group.

Chemical and Petroleum.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, KCSR recorded lower revenues for
chemical and petroleum products. This decrease was primarily a
result of lower volumes for plastic product shipments, in large
part due to the loss of a customer and lower production.
Petroleum revenues for 2003 dropped as a result of the adverse
impact of high natural gas prices on petroleum production.
Natural gas serves as both a feedstock and a source of energy
for producers. Lower agri-chemical revenues resulted from
changes in traffic mix. These declines in agri-chemical,
petroleum and plastic product revenues were partially offset by
higher revenues for gases, organic and inorganic products.
Higher revenues for gases and organic products were primarily
the result of production increases by certain customers, as well
as targeted rate increases and longer hauls due to gateway
changes. Higher revenues for inorganic products were primarily
the result of increased access to production facilities in
Geismar, Louisiana, as well as new business previously shipped
by other rail carriers, which resulted in higher traffic volume.

Forest Products and Metals.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, KCSR recorded higher revenues for forest
products and metals. Revenues for pulp and paper products as
well as scrap paper increased primarily from higher production
at KCSR’s paper mill customers and increased exports to
Mexico. The increase in lumber and plywood product revenues
resulted from continued strength in the housing and homebuilding
industry due to sustained levels of housing starts. Increases in
revenues for pulpwood/logs/chips resulted from higher production
by certain customers and targeted rate increases. Partially
offsetting these increases in forest product and metal revenues
were lower military/other revenues as a result of the reduction
of certain military training exercises, for which KCSR handles
equipment transportation, due to the associated deployment of
troops to the Middle East.

Agricultural and Mineral.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, increases in revenues for agricultural
and mineral product were primarily the result of higher revenues
for export grain, food products, ore and mineral products, as
well as stone, clay and glass products while domestic grain
remained relatively flat. Increases in revenues for export grain
reflected higher volumes of grain exports to Mexico. Food
product revenues rose as a result of a new contract with an
existing customer yielding increased carloads, as well as longer
hauls. Food product revenues also increased due to more beer
shipments from Mexico into the United States and Canada. Ore and
mineral product revenues increased due to higher demand from
producers.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Intermodal and automotive
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 declined as a
result of lower automotive revenues. Automotive revenues
declined $3.7 million as a result of the loss of certain
automotive traffic in the third quarter of 2002, as well as the
negative effects of the sluggish economy on the automotive
industry as a whole. Intermodal revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased $2.9 million as a result
of higher intermodal traffic with other connecting railroads.

Coal.

Coal revenues for the year ended December 31,
2003 declined primarily due to a decline in tons shipped related
to lower overall customer demand. A portion of the coal revenue
decline related to the loss of a coal customer in April 2002, as
well as to the impact of scheduled maintenance shutdowns in
2003, which where longer in duration compared to 2002. These
factors, which led to a reduction in coal revenues, were
partially offset by the impact of higher per-carload revenues as
a result of the use of aluminum cars, which are capable of
greater hauling capacity.

Other.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, other
rail-related revenues increased primarily as a result of higher
revenues for demurrage and other rail-related extra services,
which resulted from improved operating efficiencies associated
with the implementation of MCS in third quarter 2002. Haulage
revenue also increased slightly for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to 2002.



The following table summarizes KCS’s consolidated operating
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

Operating Expenses.

For the year ended December 31,
2003, consolidated operating expenses increased
$34.0 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. As described further below, this increase resulted
primarily from higher costs for casualties and insurance and for
fuel, which increased $31.2 million and $9.0 million,
respectively, year over year. These costs were partially offset
by lower expenses related to equipment costs and certain other
expenses arising from operating efficiencies realized through
improved employee knowledge and effectiveness in using MCS. In
2002, certain costs and expenses were higher than normal due to
the impact of the implementation of MCS and the related
congestion. The expenses most affected by the MCS implementation
were compensation and benefits, depreciation, purchased services
and car hire. See further discussion below.

Compensation and Benefits.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, consolidated compensation and benefits
expense remained unchanged at $197.8 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2002. During 2003, KCSR
experienced a reduction in the number of crew starts and lower
overtime pay in its transportation operations, even though
carload volumes increased more than 2% in 2003 compared to 2002.
We believe these improvements were partially a result of the
increased efficiency of train operations as KCSR operating
personnel gained a better understanding of the data demands of
MCS and have become more proficient at using this technology
tool to enhance train operations. Furthermore, 2002 compensation
and benefits costs were higher due to operating inefficiencies
that occurred as a result of the implementation of MCS. The
efficiency gains realized during 2003 were offset by an increase
in certain union wage rates and related back pay for prior
service time as a result of the settlement of certain union
contracts and higher overall health insurance related costs. In
2002, operating expenses were also affected by a
$1.3 million increase in expenses for the estimate of post
employment benefits arising from the Company’s third party
actuarial study and the impact of a favorable adjustment related
to the accrual for retroactive wage increases to union employees.

Purchased Services.

Consolidated purchased services
expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased
$3.9 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. The year over year increase primarily resulted from
increased legal expenses, an increase in track, bridge,
locomotive and car repairs performed by third parties and a
reduction in intermodal lift fee credits received from other
railroads. These cost increases were partially offset by higher
car repairs billed to others by KCSR and lower training expenses
in 2003. Training costs in 2002 were higher than normal due to
the training associated with the implementation of MCS. Legal
fees in 2003 were higher than 2002 due to the impact of a
$1.0 million legal settlement received in 2002 and
insurance recovery credits of $4.0 million realized in 2002.

Fuel.

Locomotive fuel costs for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased $9.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was
primarily due to an approximate 23% increase in the average cost
per gallon of fuel. KCSR’s average fuel price was
approximately $0.86 per gallon in 2003



compared to approximately $0.69 per gallon in 2002. Fuel
consumption remained relatively unchanged year over year as a
result of fuel conservation measures offsetting higher
consumption due to increased traffic volumes. Fuel costs
represented approximately 8.6% of operating costs and expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 7.4% for
the year ended December 31, 2002.

Equipment Costs.

Consolidated equipment costs for the
year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $10.2 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This decline
resulted from improved fleet utilization associated with the
implementation of MCS, as KCSR was operating more efficiently
during 2003 than in 2002. The improvement in fleet utilization
has led to an increase in the number of KCSR freight cars being
used by other railroads as well as a reduction in the number of
freight cars owned by other railroads on KCSR’s rail line.
In the last half of 2002, the congestion-related issues
associated with the implementation of MCS substantially impacted
2002 equipment costs.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Consolidated depreciation
expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased
primarily as a result of the implementation of MCS in July 2002,
which was only depreciated for six months in 2002 compared to a
full year in 2003. The remainder of the increase resulted from a
net increase in the property, plant and equipment asset base.

Casualties and Insurance.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, consolidated casualties and insurance
expense increased $31.2 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2002. This year over year increase was
primarily due to additional costs recorded during the fourth
quarter of 2003 related to personal injury liability reserves.
KCS’s process of establishing liability reserves for
personal injury incidents is based upon an actuarial study by an
independent outside actuary, a process followed by most large
railroads. This adjustment to the personal injury liability
reserves was based on this actuarial study and was required due
to adverse development of prior year claims and the continuing
tort litigious environment surrounding the railroad industry,
particularly for occupational injury claims. Also contributing
to the increase in 2003 was higher property and liability
related insurance costs, as well as the impact of
$8.5 million in legal and insurance settlements in 2002,
which reduced the comparable 2002 expense.

Other Leases.

Consolidated other lease expense for the
year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.7 million
over the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was
partially related to a new lease for maintenance vehicles and
work equipment, which in prior periods were owned by KCSR, and
partially as a result of a full year of lease payments in 2003
for the Company’s new corporate headquarters building. The
Company began leasing this facility in the second quarter of
2002.

Other Expense.

Consolidated other expense decreased
$5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily as
a result of higher gains recorded on the sale of operating
properties which increased $2.7 million year over year.

Operating Income.

Consolidated operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $18.9 million
to $29.1 million compared to $48.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Accordingly, KCS experienced
an increase in consolidated operating ratio (ratio of operating
expenses to operating revenues) of 3.5 basis points to
95.0% from 91.5% in 2002. This increase was the result of a
$34.0 million increase in operating expenses, partially
offset by a $15.1 million increase in operating revenues.

Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
Affiliates.

For the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, Grupo TFM’s operating results and KCS’s
corresponding equity in earnings under U.S. GAAP were as
follows

(in millions):

KCS Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Grupo TFM

$

$

45.8



Revenues for Grupo TFM for the year ended December 31, 2003
were adversely affected by an 8% decline in automotive shipments
year over year and the devaluation of the Mexican peso against
the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a reduction of revenues
of approximately $34 million during 2003 versus 2002.
Similar to KCSR, the increase in operating expenses at Grupo TFM
was driven by higher fuel costs, which rose $13.8 million
in 2003 versus 2002. Grupo TFM’s interest expense in 2003
increased approximately $15.3 million primarily as a result
of increased debt related to TFM’s acquisition of the
Mexican government’s ownership of Grupo TFM. For 2003, the
fluctuation in the tax benefit was the result of numerous
factors, including fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of
the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar during 2003, as well
as lower future Mexican corporate tax rates. These rate changes
had the effect of reducing Grupo TFM’s deferred tax asset,
thus reducing Grupo TFM’s deferred tax benefit.
Fluctuations in the Mexican peso exchange rate also contributed
to a $13.7 million exchange loss compared to an exchange
loss of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2002. KCS’s equity in net earnings of Grupo TFM was also
impacted by our increased ownership of Grupo TFM to 46.6% from
36.9%, which KCS obtained indirectly in July 2002 as a result of
the purchase by TFM of the Mexican government’s 24.6%
ownership of Grupo TFM.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, equity in losses from
other unconsolidated affiliates was $1.3 million compared
to equity in losses from other unconsolidated affiliates of
$2.4 million in 2002. In 2003, losses associated with PCRC
were $3.1 million compared to $3.8 million in 2002.
PCRC is not operating at full capacity as initially planned due
to the delay in completion of the port expansion at Balboa.
These losses were offset by equity in net earnings from Southern
Capital of $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Gain on Sale of Mexrail, Inc.

Net income for the year
ended December 31, 2002 includes a gain on the sale of the
Company’s investment in Mexrail of $4.4 million.

Interest Expense.

Consolidated interest expense increased
$1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest
expense rose due to higher interest rates arising from a shift
to more fixed rate debt in June 2002, partially offset by the
impact of a lower debt balance. Our debt balance declined
$59.2 million during 2003 to $523.4 million at
December 31, 2003 from $582.6 million at
December 31, 2002.

Debt Retirement Costs.

Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was reduced by debt retirement costs of
$4.3 million related to the debt refinancing during the
second quarter of 2002.

Other Income.

Other income for the year ended
December 31, 2003 declined $10.8 million compared to
2002, primarily due to substantially lower gains on the sale of
non-operating property compared to 2002 as well as the impact of
the sale of WGC in 2002. Gains recorded on the sale of
non-operating property were $0.3 million and
$7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit).

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, KCS’s income tax provision
decreased $9.7 million to a $2.8 million benefit
compared to a $6.9 million provision for the year ended
December 31, 2002, primarily due to a $63.6 million
decline in income before income taxes. This resulted in an
effective income tax rate of (600.7)% and 11.3% for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Exclusive
of equity earnings in Grupo TFM, KCS realized a pre-tax loss of
$11.8 million in 2003 compared to pre-tax income of
$18.3 million in 2002, resulting in a consolidated
effective income tax rate of 23.8% for 2003 compared to 37.7%
for 2002. This variance in the effective tax rate was primarily
the result of changes in associated book/tax temporary
differences, the level of pre-tax income, and the impact of
permanent book/tax differences on the effective rate computation.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change.

KCS adopted the
provisions of SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003. As a
result, we changed our method of accounting for removal costs of
certain track structure assets and recorded a benefit of
$8.9 million (net of income taxes of $5.6 million)
during the first quarter of 2003.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, our consolidated
cash position decreased by $96.8 million from
December 31, 2003. The primary sources of cash were as
follows: increased borrowing under the Amended 2004 Credit
Facility; cash inflows from operating activities; proceeds from
the disposal of property; and proceeds from employee stock
plans. The primary uses of cash were as follows: funding of the
escrow account for purposes of the Acquisition; investments in
and loans to affiliates; repayment of debt; costs related to the
Acquisition; cash dividends paid; and property acquisitions.

Operating Cash Flows.

KCS’s cash flow from
operations has historically been positive and sufficient to fund
operations, KCSR roadway capital expenditures, other capital
improvements and debt service. External sources of cash
(principally bank debt and public debt) have been used to
refinance existing indebtedness and to fund acquisitions, new
investments and equipment additions. The following table
summarizes consolidated operating cash flow information for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively:

(dollars in millions)

Net operating cash flows for 2004 increased $74.7 million
to $142.7 million compared to $68.0 million in 2003.
This increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
to an increase in net income, distributions from unconsolidated
affiliates, the increase in deferred tax expense recognized in
2004 and the impact of certain tax benefits related to stock
options. These factors, which increased operating cash flow,
were partially offset by changes in working capital balances
relating to the timing of payments and receipts, as well as the
discharge of certain non-current liabilities.

Net operating cash flows for 2003 declined $25.8 million to
$68.0 million compared to $93.8 million in 2002. This
decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to a
reduction of net income and



changes in working capital balances, resulting mainly from the
timing of payments and receipts, partially offset by the receipt
of income tax refunds.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash outflows were
$376.8 million and $86.0 million during the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This
$290.8 million increase was related to the
$200.0 million funding of a restricted escrow account in
anticipation of the Acquisition of Grupo TFM, the purchase of
and loans to Mexrail by KCS, increases in capital expenditures
and costs related to the Acquisition of Grupo TFM. As discussed
in “Recent Developments — Repurchase of Mexrail
Shares by KCS,” KCS repurchased a 51% stake in Mexrail from
TFM for $32.7 million and increased its loans to Tex-Mex
and Mexrail by approximately $13.4 million. Proceeds of the
loans were used by Tex-Mex and Mexrail to fund capital
improvements. During 2004, KCS capital expenditures increased by
approximately $33.2 million. Consistent with 2003, KCS also
incurred approximately $9.5 million of deferred costs
associated with the Acquisition of Grupo TFM.

Net investing cash outflows were $86.0 million and
$33.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. This $53.0 million increase in
investing cash outflows was primarily related to the sale of
Mexrail to TFM for $31.4 million in 2002. During 2003, in
contemplation of the Acquisition, KCS repurchased a 51% interest
in Mexrail for $32.7 million. In accordance with a demand
from TFM, KCS sold its interest in Mexrail back to TFM on
September 30, 2003 for $32.7 million. As a result of
these two Mexrail transactions in 2003, there was no net impact
to net investing cash outflows during 2003. Therefore, the
impact of the cash received in 2002 from the sale of Mexrail
resulted in higher comparable investing cash outflows during
2003. Also impacting net investing cash outflows for 2003 was
approximately $9.3 million of costs associated with the
Acquisition that have been deferred and included in other
investing activities. Additionally, proceeds from the sale of
property for 2003 were $3.1 million less than 2002.

Generally, operating cash flows and borrowings under lines of
credit have been used to finance property acquisitions and
investments in and loans to affiliates.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash outflows are used
primarily for the repayment of debt while financing cash inflows
are generated from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt
and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee
stock plans. During 2004, financing cash flows were also
generated through the expansion of the 2004 Credit Facility with
net proceeds of $142.4 million. Financing cash flows for
2004, 2003, and 2002 were as follows:



Contractual Obligations.

The following table outlines our
material obligations under long-term debt and other contractual
commitments at December 31, 2004. Typically, payments for
these obligations are funded through operating cash flows. If
operating cash flows are not sufficient, funds received from
other sources, including borrowings under credit facilities and
proceeds from property and other asset dispositions might also
be available. These obligations are customary transactions
similar to those entered into by others in the transportation
industry. We anticipate refinancing certain parts of our
long-term debt prior to maturity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As further described in Note 3 to KCS’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we
hold a 50% interest in Southern Capital, a joint venture that
provides us with access to equipment financing alternatives.
Southern Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition
of locomotives, rolling stock and other railroad equipment and
the leasing thereof to KCSR. On June 25, 2002, Southern
Capital refinanced the outstanding balance of certain debt
through the issuance of 5.7% pass through trust certificates and
proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. These pass through
trust certificates are secured by all of the locomotives and
rolling stock owned by Southern Capital and rental payments
payable by KCSR under the operating leases of the equipment
owned by Southern Capital. As Southern Capital is a 50% owned
unconsolidated joint venture, this debt is not reflected in
KCS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are included in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

As discussed in “Recent Developments — Mexican
Government’s Put Rights with Respect to TFM Stock,”
TMM and KCS, or either TMM or KCS, could be required to purchase
the Mexican government’s interest in TFM. If KCS and TMM,
or either KCS or TMM individually had been required to purchase
the Mexican government’s 20% interest in TFM, the total
purchase price would have been approximately $468 million
as of December 31, 2004. If the Acquisition is consummated,
KCS will assume TMM’s rights, duties and obligations with
respect to the purchase of the TFM shares subject to the Put. We
are exploring various alternatives for financing this
transaction. It is anticipated that this financing, if
necessary, can be accomplished by using capital markets. No
commitments for such financing have been obtained at this time.

Also, as described in Note 3 to KCS’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K,
under the terms of the loan agreement with International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”), we are a guarantor for up to
$5.6 million of associated debt. Also, if PCRC terminates
the concession contract without the IFC’s consent, we are a
guarantor for up to 50% of the outstanding senior loans.
Furthermore, we are a guarantor for up to $3.0 million of
the equipment loans and approximately $100,000 relating to the
other capital leases.

On March 28, 2005, PCRC and the IFC finalized an agreement
whereby PCRC would redeem the shares subscribed and owned by the
IFC pursuant to the IFC Subscription. Under the agreement, PCRC
will pay to the IFC $10.5 million. These shares have a
recorded value of $5.0 million and approximately
$2.6 million in accrued unpaid dividends. When the
transaction is completed, PCRC will record an additional cost of
approximately $2.9 million to reflect the premium paid to
IFC and, as a result, KCS expects to record its share



of this cost of approximately $1.5 million in recording its
equity in earnings of PCRC in the first quarter of 2005.

Capital Expenditures

Capital improvements for KCSR roadway track structures have
historically been funded with cash flows from operations and
external debt. We have historically used equipment trust
certificates for major purchases of locomotives and rolling
stock, while using internally generated cash flows or leasing
for other equipment. Through our Southern Capital joint venture,
we have the ability to finance railroad equipment, and
therefore, have increasingly used lease-financing alternatives
for our locomotives and rolling stock.

The following table summarizes the cash capital expenditures by
type for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

generated cash flows and borrowings are expected to be used to
fund capital programs for 2005, currently estimated at
approximately $144.0 million, of which, approximately
$55.0 million has been earmarked for new locomotive power.

KCSR Maintenance

KCSR, like other railroads, is required to maintain its own
property infrastructure. Portions of roadway and equipment
maintenance costs are capitalized and other portions are
expensed (as components of material and supplies, purchased
services and others), as appropriate. Maintenance and capital
improvement programs are in conformity with the Federal Railroad
Administration’s track standards and are accounted for in
accordance with applicable regulatory accounting rules. We
expect to continue funding roadway and equipment maintenance
expenditures with internally generated cash flows. Maintenance
expenses (exclusive of amounts capitalized) for way and
structure (roadbed, rail, ties, bridges, etc.) and equipment
(locomotives and rail cars) for the three years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a
percentage of KCSR revenues were as follows

Our consolidated debt ratio as of December 31, 2004
increased 4.2 percentage points compared to

partially offset by an increase in stockholders’ equity.
Total consolidated debt increased $142.3 million as a
result of additional borrowings under the Amended 2004 Credit
Facility, partially offset by repayments of principal.
Additionally, KCS repaid approximately $50 million of long
term debt during December of 2003. The $50 million was then
subsequently refinanced under the 2004 Credit Facility in the
first quarter of 2004. Stockholders’ equity increased
$60.8 million primarily as a result of the reclassification
from other liabilities of the tax benefits associated with the
settlement of the dispute with Stilwell of $27.1 million,
$24.4 million in net income and $9.5 million of tax
benefits associated with current year exercise of stock options
offset by $8.7 million in preferred stock dividends.

Shelf Registration Statements and Public Securities
Offerings

Kansas City Southern currently has two shelf registration
statements on file with the SEC (“Initial
Shelf” — Registration No. 33-69648;
“Second Shelf” — Registration
No. 333-61006). Securities in the aggregate amount of
$300 million remain available under the Initial Shelf and
securities in the aggregate amount of $450 million remain
available under the Second Shelf. To date, no securities have
been issued under either the Initial Shelf or Second Shelf.

Overall Liquidity

During March 2004, we refinanced the former credit facility,
including the revolving credit facility. Under the terms of the
new 2004 Credit Facility, we borrowed $150 million under
the new Term B Loan Facility due March 2008. Additionally,
the 2004 Credit Facility provides for the new 2004 Revolving
Credit Facility, which expires in March 2007, with a maximum
borrowing amount of $100 million. As of December 31,
2004, no amounts had been borrowed under the 2004 Revolving
Credit Facility. The 2004 Credit Facility contains, among other
provisions, various financial covenants. We are in compliance
with these provisions, including the financial covenants as of
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, KCS had
available borrowing under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility in
the full amount of $100 million. As a result of these
financial covenants, our borrowings under the 2004 Revolving
Credit Facility may be restricted. We do anticipate borrowings
from time to time under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility
during 2005. On December 22, 2004, we amended the 2004
Credit Facility to among other things, increase the Term B
Loan Facility by $100.0 million to a total outstanding
amount of approximately $249 million.

As described in “Recent Developments — KCS and
TMM Enter into Amended Acquisition Agreement,” we entered
into the Acquisition Agreement with TMM and other parties under
which KCS ultimately would acquire control of TFM through the
purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo TFM. Under the terms
of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS would acquire all of the
interest of TMM in Grupo TFM for $200.0 million in cash,
18 million shares of KCS common stock, and promissory notes
in the aggregate principal amount of $47.0 million to be
(held in an escrow account and reduced and released in
accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement). In addition,
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, upon successful



resolution related to the VAT Claim and the Mexican
government’s Put, KCS would pay TMM up to
$110.0 million payable in a combination of cash and KCS
common stock. At December 31, 2004, KCS funded the
restricted escrow account with $200.0. The $200.0 million
was financed with cash on hand plus the additional
$100.0 million borrowed under the Amended 2004 Credit
Facility.

As discussed in “Recent Developments — Mexican
Government’s Put Rights with Respect to TFM Stock,”
TMM and KCS, or either TMM or KCS, could be required to purchase
the Mexican government’s interest in TFM. If KCS and TMM,
or either KCS or TMM individually had been required to purchase
the Mexican government’s 20% interest in TFM, the total
purchase price would have been approximately $468 million
as of December 31, 2004. If the Acquisition is consummated,
KCS will assume TMM’s rights, duties and obligations with
respect to the purchase of the TFM shares subject to the Put. We
are exploring various alternatives for financing this
transaction. It is anticipated that this financing, if
necessary, can be accomplished by using capital markets. No
commitments for such financing have been obtained at this time.

We believe, based on current expectations, that our cash and
other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to capital
markets, borrowing capacity, and other available financing
resources are sufficient to fund anticipated operating, capital
and debt service requirements and other commitments through
2005. Also, if necessary, we believe that we will be able to
obtain the necessary financing to fund the Acquisition and the
purchase of the Mexican government’s 20% interest in TFM.
Our operating cash flow and financing alternatives, however, can
be impacted by various factors, some of which are outside of our
control. For example, if we were to experience a substantial
reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating
costs or other liabilities, our operating cash flows could be
significantly reduced. Additionally, we are subject to economic
factors surrounding capital markets and our ability to obtain
financing under reasonable terms is subject to market
conditions. Further, our cost of debt can be impacted by
independent rating agencies, which assign debt ratings based on
certain credit measurements such as interest coverage and
leverage ratios. During 2004, Moody’s downgraded our debt
rating. This reduction in our debt rating did not have any
impact on our interest rates or financial covenant ratios, but
could adversely impact borrowing costs in the future. Standard
and Poor’s currently has the Company on credit watch.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’s accounting and financial reporting policies are in
conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Management believes that the
following accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
understanding of KCS’s historical and future performance.
Management has discussed the development and selection of the
following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
of KCS’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has
reviewed the related disclosures.

Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment

The railroad industry is extremely capital intensive. Plant
maintenance and the depreciation of operating assets constitute
a substantial operating expense for KCS, as well as the railroad
industry as a whole. We capitalize costs relating to additions
and replacements of property, plant and equipment and depreciate
it consistent with industry standards and rules established by
the STB. The cost of property, plant and equipment normally
retired, less salvage value, is charged to depreciation expense
over the estimated life of the operating assets using composite
straight-line rates for financial statement purposes. The STB
approves the depreciation rates used by KCSR (excluding the
amortization of computer software). KCSR periodically conducts
studies of depreciation rates for properties and equipment and
implements approved changes, as necessary, to depreciation
rates. These studies take into consideration the historical
retirement experience of similar assets, the current condition
of the assets, current operations and potential changes in
technology, estimated salvage value of the assets, and industry
regulations. For all other consolidated subsidiaries,
depreciation is derived based upon the asset value in excess of
estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting
purposes. Depreciation is based



upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as their
net salvage value at the end of their useful lives. Estimation
of the useful lives of assets that are long-lived as well as
their salvage value requires significant management judgment.
Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates
related to depreciation expense are critical.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, changes were made to
certain depreciation rates. As described above, depreciation is
computed using group straight-line rates for financial statement
purposes, which require approval of the STB. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the registrant engaged a civil
engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage to
conduct a study to evaluate depreciation rates for properties
and equipment. The study centered on evaluating actual
historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
indicated that KCS was depreciating its property over shorter
periods than we actually utilize the assets, as estimated by the
study. Specifically, the average rate applied to the Road and
Structures Asset class (primarily rail, railroad ties and
bridges — with a depreciable cost of approximately
$1.5 billion) decreased approximately 0.7%, while the
average rate applied to the Rolling Stock and Equipment Asset
class (locomotives and railcars with a depreciable cost of
approximately $263.5 million) decreased approximately 0.5%.
The effect of this change in estimate on net income was
approximately $8.0 million, net of tax of $5.0 million
($0.12 per share, on a diluted basis), for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Currently, KCS depreciates its operating assets, including road
and structures, rolling stock and equipment, and capitalized
leases over a range of 3 to 120 years depending upon the
estimated life of the particular asset. KCS amortizes computer
software over a range of 3 to 12 years depending upon the
estimated useful life of the software. In addition to the
adjustment to rates as a result of the depreciation studies,
certain other events could occur that would materially effect
the Company’s estimates and assumptions related to
depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology
could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability
to realize the return of our investment in operating assets and,
therefore, affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge
against both current and future revenues. Because depreciation
expense is a function of analytical studies made of property,
plant and equipment, subsequent studies could result in
different estimates of useful lives and net salvage values. If
future depreciation studies yield results indicating that our
assets have shorter lives as a result of obsolescence, physical
condition, changes in technology or changes in net salvage
values, the estimate of depreciation expense could increase.
Likewise, if future studies indicate that assets have longer
lives, the estimate of depreciation expense could decrease.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated
depreciation expense (after implementation of the new rates
resulting from the 2003 study) was $53.5 million,
representing 9.6% of consolidated operating expenses. For the
year ended December 31, 2003, consolidated depreciation
expense (prior to implementation of the new rates resulting from
the 2002 study) was $64.3 million, representing 11.6% of
consolidated operating expenses. Had the new depreciation rates
been implemented in 2003, depreciation expense would have
declined approximately $12.0 million or 18.7%.

Provision for Environmental Remediation

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. The major environmental laws
to which we are subject include, among others, the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), the
Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
CERCLA can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and
investigation costs, without regard to fault or legality of the
original conduct, on current and predecessor owners and
operators of a site, as well as those who generate, or arrange
for the disposal of, hazardous substances. The risk of incurring
environmental liability is inherent in the railroad industry. We
own property that is, or has been, used for industrial purposes.
Use of these properties may subject KCS to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of
contaminants, claims alleging personal injury, or property
damage as the result of exposures to, or release of, hazardous
substances.

KCS conducts studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the
extent of environmental damage and the necessary requirements to
remediate this damage. These studies incorporate the analysis of
our internal



environmental engineering staff and consultation with legal
counsel. From these studies and surveys, a range of estimates of
the costs involved is derived and a liability and related
expense for environmental remediation is recorded within this
range. Our recorded liabilities for these issues represent our
best estimates (on an undiscounted basis) of remediation and
restoration costs that may be required to comply with present
laws and regulations. These estimates are based on forecasts of
the total future direct costs related to environmental
remediation. These estimates change periodically as additional
or better information becomes available as to the extent of site
remediation required, if any. In addition, advanced technologies
related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
and anticipated cost can influence these estimates. Certain
changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates
and assumptions related to costs for environmental remediation.
If KCS becomes subject to more stringent environmental
remediation costs at known sites, if we discover additional
contamination, discover previously unknown sites, or become
subject to related personal or property damage, KCS could incur
material costs in connection with its environmental remediation.
Accordingly, management believes that estimates related to the
accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to
our results of operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the expense related
to environmental remediation was $2.3 million and is
included as purchased services expense on the consolidated
statements of income. Additionally, as of December 31,
2004, KCS has a total liability recorded for environmental
remediation of $3.4 million. This amount was derived from a
range of reasonable estimates based upon the studies and site
surveys described above and in accordance with SFAS 5. For
environmental remediation sites known as of December 31,
2004, if the highest estimate from the range (based upon
information presently available) were recorded, the total
estimated liability would have increased approximately
$3.9 million.

Provision for Casualty Claims

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
crossing collisions, as well as claims related to personal
property damage and other casualties is a substantial expense to
KCS. Claims are estimated and recorded for known reported
occurrences as well as for incurred but not reported
(“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent with the general
practice within the railroad industry, our estimated liability
for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined on an
undiscounted basis. In estimating the liability for casualty
claims, we obtain an estimate from an independent third party
actuarial firm, which calculates an estimate using historical
experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous
assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an
estimate of future claim costs. Employees are compensated for
work related personal injury claims according to provisions
contained within the Federal Employers’ Liability Act
(“FELA”).

Our accounting policy has been to accrue for occupational injury
claims that have been asserted against KCS, based upon
management’s estimate of the cost of each case. In the case
of occupational injury claims, specifically asbestos related
claims, incurred but not yet reported, management believes that
a provision for such claims cannot be reasonably estimated as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Number 5

“Accounting for Contingencies.”

(“SFAS 5”). This is due to our low number of
claims, the lack of detailed records of the population of
potentially exposed employees, and the wide range of possible
outcomes of such claims. Management believes that any type of
estimate of the potential liability for asbestos related claims
not yet reported would not be significant to the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

Personal injury and casualty claims are subject to a significant
degree of uncertainty, especially estimates related to IBNR
personal injuries for which a party has yet to assert a claim
and, therefore, the degree to which injuries have been incurred
and the related costs have not yet been determined. In
estimating costs related to casualty claims, management must
make assumptions regarding future costs. The cost of casualty
claims is related to numerous factors, including the severity of
the injury, the age of the claimant, and the legal jurisdiction.
In deriving an estimate of the provision for casualty claims,
management must make assumptions related to substantially
uncertain matters. Changes in the assumptions used for actuarial
studies could have a material effect on the estimate of the
provision for casualty claims. Management believes that the
accounting estimate related to the liability for personal
injuries and other casualty claims is critical to our results of
operations.



For the year ended December 31, 2004, casualty expense was
approximately $17.7 million and was included in casualties
and insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Based on the methods described above, as of December 31,
2004, a range of liability of $52.8 to $57.4 million was
established. Based on the information available, our recorded
liability for casualty claims was $52.8 million. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, the provision for casualty
expense represented 3.2% of consolidated operating expenses. For
purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the
December 31, 2004 reserve were adjusted (increased or
decreased) 10%, casualty expense would have changed
$5.3 million.

Provision for Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of KCS.
For financial reporting purposes, management determines our
current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
liabilities. In accordance with the liability method of
accounting for income taxes as specified in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109

“Accounting
for Income Taxes,”

the provision for income taxes is
the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred into
the future. Currently payable income taxes represent the
liability related to KCS’s income tax return for the
current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit
represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or
liabilities as reported on the balance sheet. The changes in
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon
the changes in differences between the basis of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of
assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured using the
enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect
when these differences reverse. In addition to estimating the
future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences,
management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether
tax differences are permanent or temporary. If the differences
are temporary, management must estimate the timing of their
reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods
will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax
assets of KCS. Accordingly, management believes that the
estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical
to our results of operations.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding
the determination of the provision for income taxes. However,
certain events could occur that would materially affect our
estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes. Changes in
current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect
the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, thereby
impacting our income tax provision. Additionally, significant
declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the
realizable value of deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2004, our financial reporting basis
exceeded the tax basis of our investment in Grupo TFM by
approximately $90 million. Management has not provided a
deferred income tax liability for the income taxes, if any, that
would become payable upon the realization of this basis
difference because management considers Grupo TFM to be a
foreign corporate investment and anticipates that Grupo
TFM’s earnings will be permanently invested in Grupo TFM.
Likewise, management has no plans to realize this basis
differential by a sale of its investment in Grupo TFM. If
management were to change this assumption in determining its
provision for deferred taxes, the impact on earnings could be
significant. If the Company were to realize this basis
difference in the future by a receipt of dividends or the sale
of its investment in Grupo TFM, as of December 31, 2004,
the Company could incur additional gross federal income taxes of
approximately $31.3 million, which may be partially or
fully offset by Mexican income taxes that could be available to
reduce U.S. federal income taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, KCS’s income tax
provision was $23.6 million. Changes in management’s
estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied
to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize
the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal
of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision
for income taxes. Changes in these assumptions could potentially
change the effective tax rate. A 10% change in the effective tax
rate from 49.1% (exclusive of the equity in earnings of Grupo
TFM — see “Results of Operations —
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)”) to 59.1% would increase
the current year income tax provision approximately
$5 million.



Equity in Net Earnings of Grupo TFM

Equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is a
significant component of KCS’s net income. For financial
reporting purposes, we record equity in the net earnings of our
unconsolidated affiliates in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 “The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” For
our investment in Grupo TFM, the equity in net earnings recorded
by the Company is materially impacted by estimates included in
Grupo TFM’s tax computation. These estimates are dependent
to a certain extent on changes in Mexican tax rates,
fluctuations in the Mexican rate of inflation and changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.
To determine the income tax provision (benefit) and the value of
deferred tax assets and liabilities, Grupo TFM and KCS
management must make assumptions and estimates related to
material amounts into the future. Accordingly, management of KCS
believes that the accounting estimate made by Grupo TFM and KCS
management related to Grupo TFM’s provision for income
taxes is a “critical accounting estimate” due to its
significant impact on our results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2002, Mexico implemented changes in
its income tax laws that had an impact on KCS’s equity in
Grupo TFM’s earnings reported under the equity method of
accounting. Beginning in 2003, the Mexican legislature revised
the corporate income tax rate reducing it from 35% to 32% in
one-percent increments. Implementation of these lower corporate
income tax rates was accelerated in 2004 through further
legislation reducing the corporate tax rate from 33% in 2004 to
30% in 2005, with further reductions in 2006 and 2007 through
one-percent increments. Reflecting this change in tax rates,
combined with inflation and currency impacts, management’s
assumptions and estimates related to the value of Grupo
TFM’s deferred tax asset and deferred profit sharing as of
December 31, 2004 was approximately $253 million. The
provision for income taxes and the value of Grupo TFM’s net
deferred tax assets could be further impacted by changes in the
rate of inflation in Mexico, provisions within Mexican tax law
that provide for inflation indexation for tax purposes, as well
as changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
the Mexican peso. Changes in these estimates could have a
material impact on the Company’s equity in earnings of
Grupo TFM.

OTHER

Management Control System.

On July 14, 2002, KCSR
initiated the transition from its legacy operating system to a
platform called MCS (Management Control System). This
state-of-the-art system is designed to provide better analytical
tools for management to use in its decision-making processes.
MCS, among other things, delivers work orders to yard and train
crews to ensure that the service being provided reflects what
was sold to the customer. The system also tracks individual
shipments as they move across the rail system, compares that
movement to the service sold to the customer and automatically
reports the shipment’s status to the customer and to
operations management. If a shipment falls behind schedule, MCS
automatically generates alerts and action recommendations so
that corrective action can be promptly initiated.

During the second half of 2002, KCS’s operating results
were impacted by higher operating costs and some temporary
traffic diversions caused by congestion directly related to the
implementation of MCS. The MCS implementation slowed the
railroad as employees learned to respond to the data discipline
demanded by this system. The initial difficulties experienced by
office and field personnel in transitioning to this new platform
led to the congestion issues and operating inefficiencies, which
contributed to a decline in 2002 consolidated operating income.
By mid-November 2002, however, our operations began to
experience improved transit times and terminal activities as MCS
capabilities began to be fully integrated into KCS management
processes, and operations were virtually recovered by the end of
2002. Operating statistics, such as terminal dwell time, train
velocity and cars on-line, significantly improved during 2003
continuing through 2004, confirming this recovery. See
“Results of Operations” for further information.

Derivative Instruments.

KCS does not engage in the
trading of derivatives. Our objective for using derivative
instruments is to manage our fuel and interest rate risk to
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in fuel prices, and interest
rates. We account for derivative transactions under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended,
as set forth in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



In general, we enter into derivative transactions in limited
situations based on management’s assessment of current
market conditions and perceived risks. Management intends to
respond to evolving business and market conditions in order to
manage risks and exposures associated with our various
operations, and in so doing, may enter into such transactions
more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

Fuel expense is a
significant component of our operating expenses. Fuel costs are
affected by (i) traffic levels, (ii) efficiency of
operations and equipment, and (iii) fuel market conditions.
To stabilize the price for future fuel purchases and protect our
operating results against adverse fuel price fluctuations, from
time to time, KCSR enters into transactions, such as forward
purchase commitments and commodity swap transactions. These
derivative instruments hedge against fluctuations in the price
of No. 2 Gulf Coast Heating Oil, the commodity on which
KCSR’s diesel fuel prices are determined. Using these risk
management strategies, we are able to reduce our risk related to
rising diesel fuel prices. These derivative transactions are
correlated to market benchmarks and positions are monitored to
ensure that they will not exceed actual fuel requirements in any
period. See Item 7A and Note 10 in the Notes to
KCS’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K.

Foreign Exchange Matters.

In connection with our
investment in Grupo TFM, matters arise with respect to financial
accounting and reporting for foreign currency transactions and
for translating foreign currency transactions into
U.S. dollars. KCS follows the requirements outlined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52
“Foreign Currency Translation”
(“SFAS 52”), and related authoritative guidance.
Grupo TFM uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
Equity earnings (losses) from Grupo TFM included in our results
of operations reflect our share of any such translation gains
and losses that Grupo TFM records in the process of translating
certain transactions from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars.
Results of our investment in Grupo TFM are reported under
U.S. GAAP, while Grupo TFM reports its financial results
under IFRS. Because we are required to report our equity
earnings (losses) in Grupo TFM under U.S. GAAP and Grupo
TFM reports under IFRS, differences in deferred income tax
calculations and the classification of certain operating expense
categories occur.

We continue to evaluate existing alternatives with respect to
utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge our
U.S. dollar investment in Grupo TFM as market conditions
change or exchange rates fluctuate. At each of December 31,
2004 and 2003, we had no outstanding foreign currency hedging
instruments.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal
proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are of an
ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
current and former employees for job related injuries and by
third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. We
aggressively defend these matters and have established liability
reserves which management believes are adequate to cover
expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the
outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of the
Company’s management, such proceedings and actions should
not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Stilwell Tax Dispute.

On October 15, 2004, KCS and
Janus Capital Group Inc. (“Janus”), formerly Stilwell
Financial Inc. (“Stilwell”), finalized a settlement
agreement (“Release”), effecting settlement of all
disputes which arose on or before August 13, 2004 relating
to the spin-off of Stilwell from KCS on July 12, 2000 (the
“Spin-off”). As part of the settlement, all
arbitration claims filed by the parties with the American
Arbitration Association were dismissed. This claim involved the
entitlement to compensation expense deductions for federal
income tax purposes, associated with the exercise of certain
stock options issued by Stilwell (the “Substituted
Options”) in connection with the Spin-off. Prior to the
settlement, amounts related to the tax benefits of exercises of
the Substituted Options were recorded as a noncurrent liability
in the consolidated financial statements pending resolution of
this dispute. As a result of this settlement, the Company
reclassified approximately $27.1 million in tax benefits
from previous exercises of the Substituted Options to additional
paid in capital on the balance sheet. As previously disclosed,
the settlement had no adverse consequences to the Company.

Environmental Matters.

As discussed above in
“Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” our
operations, as well as those of our competitors, are subject to
extensive federal, state and local environmental



laws and regulations. Certain laws and regulations can impose
joint and several liability for cleanup and investigation costs,
without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on
current and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well
as those who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous
substances. We do not foresee that compliance with the
requirements imposed by the current environmental legislation
will impair our competitive capability or result in any material
additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs.
However, stricter environmental requirements relating to our
business, which may be imposed in the future, could result in
significant additional costs.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
railroad industry. Our operations involve the use and, as part
of serving the petroleum and chemicals industry, transportation
of hazardous materials. KCSR has a professional team available
to respond and handle environmental issues that might occur in
the transport of such materials. KCSR also is a partner in the
Responsible Care® program and, as a result, has initiated
certain additional environmental, health and safety practices.
KCSR performs ongoing review and evaluation of the various
environmental programs and issues within it’s operations,
and, as necessary, takes actions to limit it’s exposure to
environmental liabilities.

Although we are responsible for investigating and remediating
contamination at several locations, based on currently available
information, we do not expect any related liabilities,
individually or collectively, to have a material impact on our
results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In the
event that we do become subject to more stringent cleanup
requirements at these sites, discover additional contamination,
or become subject to related personal or property damage claims,
we could incur material costs in connection with these sites.

KCSR has been named a Potential Responsible Party (PRP) in
connection with a former foundry site in Alexandria, Louisiana.
A small portion of this property was owned through a former
subsidiary during the years 1924 to 1974 and leased to a small
foundry operator. The foundry operator, Ruston Foundry, ceased
operations in early 1990. The site is on the CERCLA National
Priorities List of contaminated sites. The United States
Environmental Protection Agency has completed a Record of
Decision of the site. Management is in the process of
negotiating a settlement with respect to this site and continues
to evaluate its potential financial statement impact. Management
has recorded its best estimate of potential liability of

$

1.7 million as of December 31, 2004 related to
potential remediation costs at this site. Further evaluation is
ongoing and any remaining exposure is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations,
financial condition, or cash flows.

KCS records liabilities for remediation and restoration costs
related to past activities when our obligation is probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of ongoing
compliance activities to current operations are expensed as
incurred. Our recorded liabilities with respect to these various
environmental issues represent our best estimates of remediation
and restoration costs that may be required to comply with
present laws and regulations. Although these costs cannot be
predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate
outcome of identified matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 in the
Notes to KCS’s Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information relative to
recent accounting pronouncements.

Regulatory Influence.

In addition to the environmental
agencies mentioned above, KCSR’s operations are regulated
by the STB, various state regulatory agencies, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(“OSHA”). State agencies regulate some aspects of rail
operations with respect to health and safety and in some
instances, intrastate freight rates. OSHA has jurisdiction over
certain health and safety features of railroad operations. We do
not foresee that regulatory compliance under present statutes
will impair our competitive capability or result in any material
effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

Inflation.

U.S. GAAP requires the use of historical
costs. Replacement cost and related depreciation expense of
KCS’s property would be substantially higher than the
historical costs reported. Any increase in expenses from these
fixed costs, coupled with variable cost increases due to
significant inflation, would be difficult to recover through
price increases given the competitive environments of our
principal subsidiaries.



Higher fuel prices have impacted KCSR’s operating results
in 2004, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31,
locomotive fuel expenses as a percentage of KCSR’s total
costs and expenses were 12.6%, in 2004, compared to 9.2% in 2003
and 7.7% in 2002. See also “Foreign Exchange Matters”
above with respect to inflation in Mexico.

Significant Customer.

Our largest coal customer accounted
for approximately 56.1% of our coal revenues and approximately
8.1% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31,
2004. The loss of all or a significant part of this business, or
a service outage at one the facilities that KCSR serves, could
materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
inherent market risks. Generally, these instruments have not
been entered into for trading purposes. The following
information, together with information included in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K
and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, which are
hereby incorporated by reference, describe the key aspects of
certain financial instruments that have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our floating-rate indebtedness totaled $249.2 million and
$98.5 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Our variable rate debt, comprised of a revolving
credit facility and a term loan, accrues interest based on
target interest indexes (e.g., London Interbank Offered
Rate — “LIBOR,” federal funds rate, etc.)
plus an applicable spread, as set forth in the credit agreement.
As a result of the 2002 refinancing of $200 million of
variable rate debt with the


/


% Notes,
we have been able to reduce our sensitivity to fluctuations in
interest rates compared to previous years. However, given the
balance of $249.2 million variable rate debt at
December 31, 2004, we are still sensitive to fluctuations
in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical 100 basis
points increase in each of the respective target interest
indexes would result in additional interest expense of
approximately $2.5 million on an annualized basis for the
floating-rate instruments held by KCS as of December 31,
2004.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
maturities, the fair value of our long-term debt was
approximately $704 million at December 31, 2004 and
$558 million at December 31, 2003.

Commodity Price Sensitivity

As described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Other — Derivative
Instruments” of this Form 10-K, KCS participates in
diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap transactions. At
December 31, 2004, KCS was a party to one fuel swap
agreement. Based on market prices at December 31, 2004, we
would receive payments from the third party counterparty of
approximately $1.1 million on the settlement date of the
agreement, representing the excess of the current market price
over the agreed upon swap price. If market prices of fuel
dropped below the swap price, then KCS would be obligated to pay
an amount equal to the difference between the market price and
the swap price for each gallon of fuel hedged. At
December 31, 2003, based on market prices in effect at that
time, we would have received payments from the third party
counterparty of approximately $0.9 million on the
settlement date of the agreement, representing the excess of the
current market prices over the agreed upon swap price. A
hypothetical 10% increase in the price of diesel fuel would have
resulted in additional fuel expense of approximately
$6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.



At December 31, 2004, we held fuel inventories for use in
operations. These inventories were not material to our overall
financial position. With the exception of the 4% of fuel
currently hedged under fuel swap transactions for 2005, fuel
costs are expected to mirror market conditions in 2005.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity

We own a 46.6% interest in Grupo TFM, incorporated in Mexico. In
connection with our investment in Grupo TFM, matters arise with
respect to financial accounting and reporting for foreign
currency transactions and for translating foreign currency
transactions into U.S. dollars. Grupo TFM uses the
U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Equity earnings
(losses) from Grupo TFM included in our results of operations
reflect our share of any such translation gains and losses that
Grupo TFM records in the process of translating certain
transactions from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars. Therefore,
we have exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Mexican
peso. While not currently utilizing foreign currency instruments
to hedge our U.S. dollar investment in Grupo TFM, we
continue to evaluate existing alternatives as market conditions
and exchange rates fluctuate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or
“the Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).
KCS’s internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board
of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, KCS
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on the framework established by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(“COSO”). Based on its evaluation, KCS management
concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004
based on the criteria outlined in the COSO framework.

KCS management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their attestation report, which is included herein on
page 57.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in “Internal Control —
Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Kansas City
Southern’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Kansas City Southern and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and our
report dated March 29, 2005, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The
financial statements of Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria
Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo TFM), a 46.6% owned investee
company, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003 were audited by other auditors whose reports have been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for Grupo TFM as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, is based solely on the reports
of other auditors.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Grupo
Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo TFM), a
46.6% owned investee company, as of December 31, 2004 and
2003 or for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The
Company’s investment in Grupo TFM at December 31, 2004
and 2003 was $389.6 million and $392.1 million,
respectively, and its equity in earnings (loss) of Grupo TFM was
$(2.4) million and $12.3 million for years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The financial
statements of Grupo TFM as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 were audited by other auditors
whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion,
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Grupo TFM as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, is
based solely on the reports of other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits, and the reports of other
auditors for 2004 and 2003, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Kansas City Southern and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Kansas City Southern’s and subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 29, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
of, and the effective operation of, internal control over
financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Description of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
“Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was
initially organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc. In 2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas
City Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal
operations in rail transportation. KCS’s principal
subsidiaries and affiliates, which are reported under one
business segment, include the following:

KCS, along with its principal subsidiaries and joint ventures,
owns and operates a rail network that links key commercial and
industrial markets in the United States and Mexico. The Company
also has a strategic alliance with the Canadian National Railway
Company (“CN”) and Illinois Central Corporation
(“IC”) (collectively “CN/ IC”) and other
marketing agreements, which provide the ability for the Company
to expand its geographic reach.

KCS’s rail network, including its joint ventures, strategic
alliances and marketing agreements, connects shippers in the
midwestern and eastern regions of the United States, including
shippers utilizing Chicago, Illinois and Kansas City,
Missouri — the two largest rail centers in the United
States — with the largest industrial centers of Canada
and Mexico, including Toronto, Edmonton, Mexico City and
Monterrey. KCS’s rail system, through its core network,
strategic alliances and marketing agreements, interconnects with
all Class I railroads in North America.

KCSR, which owns and operates one of seven Class I
railroads in the United States, within a ten-state region that
includes Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi,
Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas and Illinois. KCSR, which
traces its origins to 1887, offers the shortest north/south rail
route between Kansas City and several key ports along the Gulf
of Mexico in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Additionally,
KCSR, in conjunction with the Norfolk Southern Railway Company
(“Norfolk Southern”), operates the most direct rail
route (referred to as the “Meridian Speedway”),
between the Atlanta, Georgia and Dallas, Texas rail gateways,
for rail traffic moving between the southeast and southwest
regions of the United States. The Meridian Speedway also
provides eastern shippers and other U.S. and Canadian railroads
with an efficient connection to Mexican markets. KCSR’s
rail route also serves the east/west route linking Kansas City
with East St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois. Further,
KCSR has limited haulage rights between Springfield and Chicago
that allow for shipments that originate or terminate on the
former Gateway Western’s rail lines. These lines also
provide access to East St. Louis and allow rail traffic to
avoid the St. Louis, Missouri terminal. KCSR’s
geographic reach enables service to a customer base that
includes, among others, electric generating utilities, which use
coal, and a wide range of companies in the chemical and
petroleum, agricultural and mineral, forest product and metal,
and automotive and intermodal markets.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s rail network links directly to major trading
centers in Mexico through TFM and Tex-Mex. TFM operates a
railroad from the U.S./ Mexican border at Laredo, Texas to
Mexico City and serves most of Mexico’s principal
industrial cities and three of its major shipping ports. The
Company owns 51% of Mexrail, which in turn wholly-owns Tex-Mex.
Tex-Mex operates between Laredo and the port city of Corpus
Christi, Texas. TFM, through its concession with the Mexican
government, has the right to control and operate the southern
half of the rail-bridge at Laredo. Through its ownership of
Mexrail, the Company indirectly controls the northern half of
the rail-bridge at Laredo, which spans the Rio Grande River
between the United States and Mexico.

Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements are presented using the
accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
influence, but not more than 50% voting interest; the cost
method of accounting is generally used for investments of less
than 20% voting interest. As it relates to the Company’s
51% investment in Mexrail, the equity method of accounting was
used pending the STB’s approval of KCS’s application
for control of Tex-Mex which was effective December 29,
2004. Shares representing 51% voting control of TexMex were
transferred from the trustee to KCS on January 1, 2005.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial reporting
policies of the Company conform with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Management reviews its estimates, including
those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets,
as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental
remediation, casualty claims, and income taxes. Changes in facts
and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes freight
revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a commodity
movement. Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the
product is shipped, as services are performed or contractual
obligations fulfilled.

Cash Equivalents.

Short-term liquid investments with an
initial maturity of generally three months or less are
considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 also includes a $10 million
deposit in connection with the litigation under the Original
Acquisition Agreement which will be refunded on completion of
the Acquisition.

Restricted Funds — Escrow Account for Grupo TFM
Acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition of TFM,
$200 million has been deposited into an escrow account.
Such amounts are restricted for the purpose of that transaction
and can only be released to the Company if the transaction is
terminated.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable, net
includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for
uncollectible account as determined based on historical
experience and may be adjusted for economic

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

uncertainties or known trends. Accounts are charged to the
allowance for bad debts when a customer enters bankruptcy, when
an account has been transferred to a collection agent or
submitted for legal action and in certain other cases, when a
customer is significantly past due and all available means of
collection have been exhausted.

Inventories.

Materials and supplies inventories are
valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Properties and Depreciation.

Properties are stated at
cost. Additions and renewals, including those on leased assets
that increase the life or utility of the asset are capitalized
and all properties are depreciated over the estimated remaining
life or lease term of such assets, whichever is shorter.
Depreciation for railway operating assets is derived using the
group-life method. This method classifies similar assets by
equipment or road type and depreciates these assets as a whole.
Ordinary maintenance and repairs and major maintenance
activities are charged to expense as incurred.

The cost of transportation equipment and road property normally
retired, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated
depreciation. The cost of industrial and other property retired,
and the cost of transportation property abnormally retired,
together with accumulated depreciation thereon, are eliminated
from the property accounts and the related gains or losses are
reflected in net income. Gains recognized on the sale or
disposal of operating properties that were reflected in
operating income were $3.2 million,

$5.9 million and $3.1 million in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of
non-operating property reflected in other income were
$0.6 million, $0.3 million, and $7.4 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Depreciation is computed using group straight-line rates for
financial statement purposes, which require approval of the STB.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, KCSR engaged a
civil engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage
to conduct a study to evaluate deprecation rates for properties
and equipment. The study centered on evaluating actual
historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
indicated that KCS was depreciating its property over shorter
periods than it actually utilized the assets, as estimated by
the study. Specifically, the average rate applied to the Road
and Structures Asset class (primarily rail, railroad ties and
bridges) decreased approximately 0.7%, while the average rate
applied to the Rolling Stock and Equipment Asset class
(locomotives and railcars) decreased approximately 0.6%. The
effect of this change in depreciation rates on net income was
approximately $8.0 million, net of tax of $5.0 million
($0.12 per share, on a diluted basis), for the year ended
December 31, 2004. Depreciation for other consolidated
subsidiaries is computed based on the asset value in excess of
estimated salvage value using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes. The
ranges of annual depreciation rates for financial statement
purposes are:

Road and structures

2% - 14%

Rolling stock and equipment

2% - 22%

Computer software

8% - 14%

Capitalized leases

3% -  7%

Long-lived assets.

The Company evaluates the
recoverability of its operating properties when there is an
indication that an asset value has been impaired. The
measurement of possible impairment is based primarily on the
ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from expected
future operating cash flows related to the assets on an
undiscounted basis. At December 31, 2004, there were no
assets which required an impairment adjustment.

On February 24, 2005, the Company took one 28.5-mile branch
line out of service for further assessment of track condition.
The Company will be evaluating possible alternatives including,
but not limited to, repair, replacement, sale, abandonment, or a
combination of the above. The results of this evaluation could
impact the 2005 financial results of the Company.

Casualty Claims.

Casualty claims in excess of
self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
The Company’s casualty liability reserve is based on a
study by an independent third party actuarial firm performed on
an undiscounted basis. The reserve is based on claims filed and
an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While the
ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims.
Adjustments to the liability will be reflected as operating
expenses in the period in which the adjustments are known.

For occupational injury claims, an assessment is made on a
case-by-case basis and a liability is established when
management determines that it is probable and reasonably
estimable. In the case of incurred but not yet reported
occupational injury claims, specifically asbestos related
claims, management believes that a provision for such claims
cannot be reasonably estimated as required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5

“Accounting for
Contingencies.”

(“SFAS 5”). This is due
to our low number of claims, the lack of detailed records of the
population of potentially exposed employees, and the wide range
of possible outcomes of such claims. Management believes that
any type of estimate of the potential liability for asbestos
related claims not yet reported would not be significant to the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Computer Software Costs.

Costs incurred in conjunction
with the purchase or development of computer software for
internal use are capitalized. Costs incurred in the preliminary
project stage, as well as training and maintenance costs, are
expensed as incurred. Direct and indirect costs associated with
the application development stage of internal use software are
capitalized until such time that the software is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the
software. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, a total of
approximately $59.7 million and $58.0 million,
respectively, was capitalized (including a total of
approximately $5.9 million of capitalized interest costs)
for the transportation operating system, MCS, which was
implemented in July 2002. There were no additional costs
capitalized in 2004.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The Company’s
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, lease and contract receivables, accounts
payable and long-term debt.

The financial statement carrying value of the Company’s
cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term
nature. Carrying value approximates fair value for all financial
instruments with six months or less to re-pricing or maturity
and for financial instruments with variable interest rates. The
Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt based upon
borrowing rates available at the reporting date for indebtedness
with similar terms and average maturities. Based upon the
borrowing rates currently available to the Company and its
subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was approximately
$704 million and $558 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The financial statement carrying
value was $665 million and $523 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Derivative Instruments.

Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended, requires that
derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded either through current earnings or as
other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedge
transaction. Gains and losses on the derivative instrument
reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified into
earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the
variability of the cash flow of the hedged item. The ineffective
portion of all hedge transactions is recognized in current
period earnings. KCS adopted the provisions of SFAS 133, as
amended, effective January 1, 2001.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of transactions
reported in different periods for financial reporting and income
tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method of
accounting for income



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

taxes. This method gives consideration to the future tax
consequences of the deferred income tax items and immediately
recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.

Grupo TFM provides deferred income taxes for the difference
between the financial reporting and income tax bases of its
assets and liabilities. The Company records its proportionate
share of these income taxes through its equity in Grupo
TFM’s earnings. For all years presented, the Company has
not provided deferred income taxes for the temporary difference
between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of
its investment in Grupo TFM because Grupo TFM is a foreign
corporate joint venture that is considered permanent in
duration, and the Company does not expect the reversal of the
temporary difference to occur in the foreseeable future.

Changes of Interest in Subsidiaries and Equity Investees.

A change of the Company’s interest in a subsidiary or
equity investee resulting from the sale of the subsidiary’s
or equity investee’s stock is generally recorded as a gain
or loss in the Company’s net income in the period that the
change of interest occurs. If an issuance of stock by the
subsidiary or affiliate is from treasury shares on which gains
have been previously recognized, however, KCS will record the
gain directly to its equity and not include the gain in net
income. A change of interest in a subsidiary or equity investee
resulting from a subsidiary’s or equity investee’s
purchase of its stock increases the Company’s ownership
percentage of the subsidiary or equity investee. The Company
records this type of transaction under the purchase method of
accounting, whereby any excess of fair market value over the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as
goodwill.

Treasury Stock.

The excess of par over cost of the
preferred shares held in Treasury is credited to paid in
capital. Common shares held in Treasury are accounted for as if
they were retired and the excess of cost over par value of such
shares is charged to paid in capital.

Stock Plans.

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options or subscriptions are credited to the appropriate
stockholders’ equity accounts in the year exercised.

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”), compensation expense is recognized
ratably over the option vesting period to the extent that an
option exercise price is less than the market price of the stock
at the date of grant. KCS’s practice is to set the option
exercise price equal to the market price of the stock at date of
grant; therefore, no compensation expense is recognized for
financial reporting purposes.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“SFAS 123”) in October 1995. This statement
allows companies to continue under the approach set forth in
APB 25 for recognizing stock-based compensation expense in
the financial statements, but encourages companies to adopt the
fair value method of accounting for employee stock options.
Under SFAS 123, companies must either record compensation
expense based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock
options granted or disclose the impact on net income as if they
had adopted the fair value method (for grants subsequent to
December 31, 1994). If KCS had measured compensation cost
for the KCS stock options granted to its employees and shares
subscribed by its employees under the KCS employee stock
purchase plan, under the fair value based method prescribed by



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS 123 (see additional information regarding
SFAS 123R under “New Accounting Pronouncements”),
net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

All shares held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(“ESOP”) are treated as outstanding for purposes of
computing the Company’s earnings per share. See additional
information on the ESOP in Note 8.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if convertible securities and stock
options were converted into common stock or exercised.

The following is a reconciliation from the weighted average
shares used for the basic earnings per share computation to the
weighted average shares used for the diluted earnings per share
computation for the three years ended December 31, 2004 (in
thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 13,389,120
and 8,926,080 potential dilutive shares, respectively, related
to the $1 par, 4.25% Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock, Series C (“Convertible Preferred
Stock”) were excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the inclusion of these shares would
have been anti-dilutive to earnings per share. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, 1,356,879 potential dilutive
shares related to stock options were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the inclusion
of these shares would have been anti-dilutive to earnings per
share. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, 361,500, 261,093 and 320,687 shares, respectively,
related to stock options were excluded from the calculation of
diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of the common shares.

The only adjustment that currently affects the numerator of the
Company’s diluted earnings per share computation is
preferred dividends. During 2004 and 2003, preferred dividends
of $8.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, were
deducted from net income to calculate basic earnings per share.
Additionally, because the potentially dilutive shares relating
to the Convertible Preferred Stock were anti-dilutive, these
convertible preferred dividends ($8.5 million and
$5.7 million earned during 2004 and 2003, respectively)
were also deducted from net income to calculate diluted earnings
per share. Additional preferred dividends of



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$0.2 million were deducted from net income in 2004, 2003
and 2002 and were related to the $25 par, 4% noncumulative
preferred stock.

Postretirement benefits.

The Company provides certain
medical, life and other postretirement benefits to certain
retirees. The costs of such benefits are expensed over the
estimated period of employment.

Environmental liabilities.

The Company records
liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to
past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable
and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future
expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to
their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation
costs from others parties are recorded as assets when their
receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance
activities related to current operations are expensed as
incurred.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

SFAS 123R

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised), “Share-Based
Payments” (“SFAS 123R”), which is effective
for the first interim period ending after June 15, 2005.
Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to measure
the cost of employee service received in exchange for awards of
stock options based upon the fair value of the options as of
their grant date. The cost of the employee service will be
recognized as compensation cost ratably over the option vesting
period. Currently, the Company recognizes compensation expense
pursuant to APB 25, whereby compensation expense is
recognized to the extent that an option price is less than the
market price of the stock at the date of the grant (the
“Intrinsic Value”). Because KCS’s practice is to
set the option exercise price equal to the market price of the
stock as of the date of the grant, no compensation expense is
recognized for financial reporting purposes. SFAS 123R
allows the use of either the Black-Scholes or a lattice
option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of options.
SFAS 123R allows either a Modified Prospective Application,
which applies to new awards and modified awards after the
effective date, and to any unvested awards as service is
rendered on or after the effective date, or a Modified
Retrospective Application, which would apply either to all prior
years for which SFAS 123 was effective or to only prior
interim periods in the year of adoption of SFAS 123R.
Currently, the Company is evaluating these adoption alternatives
and expects to complete this evaluation during the second
quarter of 2005. As described above under “Stock
Plans,” using the Black-Scholes method, the expense related
to share based compensation would have been $1.6 million,
$1.8 million and $1.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively. The impact on future
operating results will be dependent on the type and extent of
stock-based compensation to be issued as determined by the
Company’s Compensation Committee and cannot be determined
at this time.

EITF 04-08

In October 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a
consensus on EITF Issue No. 04-08 “Accounting Issues
Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and
the Effect of Diluted Earnings Per Share”
(“EITF 04-08”), which was effective for reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF 04-08
requires contingently convertible securities to be included in
the dilutive earnings per share calculation, if dilutive,
regardless of whether the contingency has been met. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s Convertible
Preferred Stock was anti-dilutive and, accordingly, was excluded
from the dilutive earnings per share calculation.

SFAS 143

KCS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (“SFAS 143”) effective for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Under SFAS 143, the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation must be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. The
associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset. KCSR, along with other
Class I railroads, depreciates track structure (rail, ties,
and other track material) in accordance with regulations
promulgated by the STB. These regulations require KCSR to
depreciate track structure to a net salvage value (gross
estimated salvage value less estimated costs to remove the track
structure at the end of its useful life). For certain track
structure such as ties, with little or no gross salvage value,
this practice ultimately results in depreciating an asset below
a value of zero, and thus, in effect, results in recording a
liability. Under the requirements of SFAS 143, in the
absence of a legal obligation to remove the track structure,
such accounting practice is prohibited. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS 143 in the first quarter of 2003, and,
as a result, reviewed its depreciation of track structures to
determine instances where the depreciation of removal costs has
resulted or would be expected (based on the current depreciation
rate) to result in the depreciation of an asset below zero when
considering net salvage value. As a result of this review, the
Company estimated the excess depreciation recorded on such
assets and recorded this amount as a reduction in accumulated
depreciation of $14.5 million and as a cumulative effect of
an accounting change of $8.9 million (net of taxes of
$5.6 million) as required by SFAS 143 in the first
quarter of 2003. Additionally, depreciation rates applied to
certain track structure elements that were previously yielding a
negative salvage value have been modified to comply with the
provisions of SFAS 143. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, this resulted in a reduction in
depreciation expense of approximately $1.4 million, net of
tax, in each year.

A summary of the pro forma net income and earnings per share had
SFAS 143 been applied retroactively is as follows:

FIN 46(revised)

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”). The Company
adopted FIN 46R effective for the year ended
December 31, 2003. FIN 46R clarifies the application
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain
variable interest entities by providing guidance on how a
business entity should evaluate whether it has controlling
financial interest in an entity through means other than voting
rights and how the entity should be consolidated. FIN 46R
replaces Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which was issued in January
2003. The Company performed an assessment of its equity method
investments in Southern Capital and PCRC for any potential
impact this interpretation may have on its accounting for these
entities as equity investments. The adoption of FIN 46R had
no material impact on the Company’s accounting for its
investment in Southern Capital or PCRC since, at inception,
these entities had sufficient funding and capital.

Significant Customer.

Our largest coal customer,

approximately 8.1% of our total revenues for the year ended

or a significant part of this business, or a service outage at

affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

Grupo TFM and Mexrail Acquisition Costs

As further described in “Note 3 — KCS and
TMM Enter Into Acquisition Agreement”, on December 15,
2004, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated
Acquisition Agreement (“Acquisition Agreement”) with
TMM and other parties under which KCS would acquire control of
TFM through the purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo TFM
(the “Acquisition”). Pending completion of the
transactions to acquire Grupo TFM and Mexrail, the Company has
capitalized those costs that are directly related to the
acquisitions and will include them as part of the ultimate
purchase price of the acquisitions. Specifically, these costs
include external costs for due diligence, fees and support for
the filing of regulatory documents, fees related to obtaining
regulatory approvals, trustee fees associated with the
regulatory review period, arbitration costs and legal fees
associated with the enforcement of the Acquisition Agreement. No
internal costs have been capitalized as acquisition costs. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 costs of approximately
$18.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively, related
to the acquisitions of Grupo TFM and Mexrail have been deferred
and are reported as “other assets” in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Should the Company determine that
the Grupo TFM acquisition will not occur the capitalized costs
related to that acquisition will be written off in the period in
which the acquisition is abandoned.

Grupo TFM

In July 1996, the Company and Transportación Maritima
Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (now Grupo TMM, S.A., “TMM”)
formed Grupo TFM to participate in the privatization of the
Mexican railroad system. In December 1996, the Mexican
government awarded Grupo TFM the right to acquire an 80%
interest (representing 100% of the shares with unrestricted
voting rights) in TFM for approximately 11.072 billion
Mexican pesos (approximately $1.4 billion based on the
U.S. dollar/ Mexican peso exchange rate on the award date).
TFM holds a 50-year concession (with the option of a 50-year
extension subject to certain conditions) to operate
approximately 2,650 miles of track that directly links
Mexico City and Monterrey (as well as Guadalajara through
trackage rights) with the ports of Lazaro Cardenas, Veracruz and
Tampico and the Mexican/ United States border crossings of Nuevo
Laredo-Laredo, Texas and Matamoros-Brownsville, Texas.
TFM’s route network provides a connection to the major
industrial and population areas of Mexico from the United
States. TFM interchanges traffic with Tex-Mex and the Union
Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) at Laredo, Texas.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company and TMM exercised their call option and, on
July 29, 2002, completed the purchase of the Mexican
government’s 24.6% ownership of Grupo TFM. The Mexican
government’s ownership interest of Grupo TFM was purchased
by TFM for $256.1 million, utilizing a combination of
proceeds from an offering by TFM of debt securities, a credit
from the Mexican government for the reversion of certain rail
facilities and other resources. This transaction resulted in an
increase in the Company’s ownership percentage of Grupo TFM
from 36.9% to approximately 46.6%. The purchase price was
calculated by accreting the Mexican government’s initial
investment of approximately $199 million from the date of
the Mexican government’s investment through the date of the
purchase, using the interest rate on one-year U.S. Treasury
securities.

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s investment in
Grupo TFM was approximately $389.6 million. The
Company’s interest in Grupo TFM is approximately 46.6%,
with TMM owning approximately 48.5%, and the remaining 4.9% is
owned indirectly by the Mexican government through its 20%
ownership of TFM. The Company has a management services
agreement with Grupo TFM to provide certain consulting and
management services. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
$2.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, is
reflected as a related party account receivable in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet related to this
management services agreement. Total management fees billed to
Grupo TFM were $1.3 million, $1.3 million and
$1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company accounts for its
investment in Grupo TFM under the equity method.

The Company is party to certain agreements with TMM covering
Grupo TFM, which contain “change of control”
provisions, provisions intended to preserve the Company’s
and TMM’s proportionate ownership of the venture, and super
majority provisions with respect to voting on certain
significant transactions. Such agreements also provide a right
of first refusal in the event that either party initiates a
divestiture of its equity interest in Grupo TFM. Under certain
circumstances, such agreements could affect the Company’s
ownership percentage and rights in these equity affiliates. All
of these agreements terminate upon completion of the acquisition
by the Company of the shares of Grupo TFM currently controlled
by TMM.

KCS and TMM Enter Into Acquisition Agreement.

On
December 15, 2004, the Company entered into the Acquisition
Agreement with TMM and other parties under which KCS would
acquire control of TFM through the purchase of shares of common
stock of Grupo TFM. Grupo TFM holds an 80% economic interest in
TFM and all of the shares of stock with full voting rights of
TFM. The remaining 20% economic interest in TFM is owned by the
Mexican government in the form of shares with limited voting
rights. The Mexican government has put rights with respect to
its TFM shares as discussed below. The obligations of KCS and
TMM to complete the Acquisition are subject to a number of
conditions which are discussed below.

The purpose of the Acquisition is to place TFM under the control
of KCS, which already controls KCSR, Tex-Mex and Gateway
Eastern. Management believes that common control of these
railroads, which are already physically linked in an end-to-end
configuration, will enhance competition and give shippers in the
NAFTA trade corridor a strong transportation alternative as they
make their decisions to move goods between the United States,
Mexico and Canada. In addition, our management believes that
this common control offers stockholders greater value through
the operating efficiencies expected to come from common
ownership and control.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS would acquire
all of TMM’s interest in Grupo TFM for $200.0 million
in cash, 18 million shares of KCS common stock,
$47.0 million in a two-year promissory note (the
“Escrow Note”), and up to $110.0 million payable
(“VAT Contingency Payment”) in a combination of cash
and KCS common stock. Cash of $200.0 million has been
deposited in a restricted escrow account. Both the
$200.0 million cash and the 18 million shares of KCS
common stock are payable at closing. The $47 million Escrow
Note is subject to indemnification provisions of the Acquisition
Agreement. The amount payable under the Escrow Note can be
reduced by the amount of certain potential losses related to
breaches of certain representations, warranties, or covenants in
the Acquisition Agreement or claims relating thereto, or under
other conditions specified in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. An
additional $110.0 million



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

could become payable upon the Final Resolution of the VAT Claim
and Put, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement.

In connection with the Acquisition, KCS has entered into a
consulting agreement with José F. Serrano International
Business, S.A. de C.V., a consulting company controlled by Jose
Serrano, Chairman of the Board of TMM, Grupo TFM and TFM, to
become effective upon the closing of the Acquisition, pursuant
to which it would provide consulting services to KCS in
connection with the portion of the business of KCS in Mexico for
a period of three years. As consideration for these services,
the consulting company would receive an annual fee of
$3,000,000. The Consulting Agreement requires KCS to deposit the
total amount of fees payable under the Consulting Agreement
($9,000,000) in an escrow account to be held and released in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Consulting
Agreement and the applicable escrow agreement.

On October 6, 2004, Mexico’s Foreign Investment
Commission (“FIC”) notified KCS of its approval of
KCS’s new application for authority to acquire TMM’s
interest in TFM. This approval is necessary for a foreign
company to become a majority owner of a Mexican railway company
and remains valid until October 5, 2005. KCS’s
notification with respect to the acquisition of the Grupo TFM
shares was filed with the Mexican Competition Commission
(“MCC” or the “Competition Commission”) on
April 21, 2003. KCS received formal written notice that the
MCC had approved the proposed consolidation, without conditions.
Through a series of extensions received from MCC, KCS’s
authority to purchase TMM’s interest in TFM remains valid
through April 5, 2005. On January 25, 2005, the 30-day
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”)
expired without a formal request from the U.S. Department
of Justice (“DOJ”) for additional information or
documentary material. This will allow KCS and TMM to complete
the transaction without an antitrust challenge from the DOJ.
With the extension of the Competition Commission approval,
approval from the Mexican Foreign Investment Commission and
completion of the HSR process, our shareholder approval of the
issuance of the shares required under the Acquisition Agreement
was the final condition precedent to completion of the proposed
Acquisition. On March 29, 2005, at a special meeting of the
KCS shareholders approval of the acquisition as described above
was received. Closing on the acquisition is expected to occur on
April 1, 2005.

Mexican Government’s Put Rights With Respect to TFM
Stock.

Under the terms of the January 31,
1997 share purchase agreement through which Grupo TFM
agreed to purchase the shares of TFM, as amended by the parties
on June 9, 1997 (the “TFM Share Purchase
Agreement”), the Mexican government has the right to compel
the purchase of its 20% interest in TFM (referred to as the
“Put”) by Grupo TFM following its compliance with the
terms and conditions of the TFM Share Purchase Agreement. Upon
exercise of the Put in accordance with the terms of the TFM
Share Purchase Agreement, Grupo TFM would be obligated to
purchase the TFM capital stock at the initial share price paid
by Grupo TFM adjusted for interest and inflation. Prior to
October 30, 2003, Grupo TFM filed suit in the Federal
District Court of Mexico City seeking, among other things, a
declaratory judgment interpreting whether Grupo TFM was
obligated to honor its obligation under the TFM Share Purchase
Agreement, as the Mexican government had not made any effort to
sell the TFM shares subject to the Put prior to October 31,
2003. In its suit, Grupo TFM named TMM and KCS as additional
interested parties. The Mexican Court has admitted Grupo
TFM’s complaint and issued an injunction that blocked the
Mexican government from exercising the Put. The Mexican
government provided Grupo TFM with notice of its intention to
sell its interest in TFM on October 30, 2003. Grupo TFM has
responded to the Mexican government’s notice reaffirming
its right and interest in purchasing the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM, but also advising
the Mexican government that it would not take any action until
its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment was resolved. In the
event that Grupo TFM does not purchase the Mexican
government’s 20% interest in TFM, TMM and KCS, or either of
TMM or KCS alone, would, following notification by the Mexican
government in accordance with the terms of the TFM Share
Purchase Agreement, be obligated to purchase the Mexican
government’s remaining interest in TFM. As this matter is
currently the subject of litigation in Mexico to which the
Mexican government, Grupo TFM, TMM and KCS are parties, KCS
management does not believe it is likely that the

Mexican government will seek to exercise the Put until the
litigation is resolved. On completion of the Acquisition, KCS
will assume TMM’s rights and obligations to make any
payment upon the exercise by the Mexican government of the Put
and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees and shareholders, against
obligations or liabilities relating thereto. If KCS had been
required to purchase this interest as of December 31, 2004,
the total purchase price would have been approximately
$468 million.

Value Added Tax (“VAT”) Lawsuit and VAT Contingency
Payment under the Acquisition Agreement.

The VAT lawsuit
(“VAT Claim”) arose out of the Mexican Treasury’s
delivery of a VAT credit certificate to a Mexican governmental
agency rather than to TFM in 1997. The face value of the VAT
credit at issue is 2,111,111,790 pesos or approximately
$189 million in U.S. dollars, based on current
exchange rates. The amount of the VAT refund will, in accordance
with Mexican law, reflect the face value of the VAT credit
adjusted for inflation and interest from 1997.

After several Mexican Fiscal Court and Mexican appellate court
rulings during 2002 and 2003, on January 19, 2004, TFM
received a Special Certificate from the Mexican Federal Treasury
in the amount of $2.1 billion pesos. The Special
Certificate delivered to TFM on January 19, 2004 has the
same face amount as the original VAT refund claimed by TFM in
1997. TFM also filed a complaint against the Mexican government,
seeking to have the amount of the Special Certificate adjusted
to reflect interest and inflation in accordance with Mexican
law. The Mexican Fiscal Court initially denied TFM’s claim.
In a decision dated November 24, 2004, the Mexican Federal
Appellate Court upheld TFM’s claim that it is entitled to
inflation and interest from 1997 on the VAT refund. The Federal
Appellate Court remanded the case to the Mexican Fiscal Court
with instructions to enter a new order consistent with this
decision. On January 26, 2005, the Mexican Fiscal Court
issued from the bench an oral order implementing the Appellate
Court decision. On February 18, 2005, TFM was served with
the written order from the Mexican Fiscal Court.

Under the Acquisition Agreement, in the event of the Final
Resolution of the VAT Claim and Put (as such term is defined in
the Acquisition Agreement), KCS will be obligated to pay to TMM
an additional amount (referred to as the “VAT Contingency
Payment”) of up to $110 million payable in a
combination of cash and KCS common stock. If the Acquisition is
completed, KCS will assume TMM’s obligations to make any
payment upon the successful exercise by the Mexican government
of the Put and will indemnify TMM and its affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees and shareholders,
against obligations or liabilities relating thereto.

1997 Tax Audit Summary.

TFM was served on
January 19, 2004 with an official letter notifying TFM of
the Mexican government’s preliminary findings and
conclusions arising from its tax audit of TFM’s 1997 tax
returns (“Tax Audit Summary”). In the Tax Audit
Summary, the Mexican government notified TFM of its preliminary
conclusion that the documentation provided by TFM in support of
the VAT refund claim and depreciation of the TFM concession
title, and the assets reported on TFM’s 1997 tax return do
not comply with the formalities required by the applicable tax
legislation. In addition, the Mexican government attached the
Special Certificate pending resolution of the audit. TFM has
advised that it has, within the time allowed by the Tax Audit
Summary, contested the conclusions of the Mexican tax
authorities, and it has filed a constitutional appeal against
the Tax Audit Summary, alleging the process followed by the
Mexican government violated TFM’s constitutional rights. On
March 16, 2005, TFM was notified by the Mexican Fiscal
Administration Service (

“Servicio de Administración
Tributaria”

or the

“SAT”

) that it had
finished its audit of TFM’s 1997 tax returns. The SAT had
not yet assessed any penalties or taxes against TFM as a result
of the audit. In the notice, the SAT stated that TFM did not
supply documentation complying with the requirements of the
Mexican fiscal code and, therefore, it was not entitled in its
1997 tax returns to depreciate and deduct the concession title,
the railway equipment and other assets that were assets of TFM
at the time that it was privatized in 1997. KCS and TMM continue
discussions with the Mexican government to resolve the
outstanding disputes between the parties.

Mexrail

On August 16, 2004, KCS, TMM and TFM entered into a new
Stock Purchase Agreement (“New Mexrail Stock Purchase
Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, KCS
purchased from TFM 51% of the outstanding shares of Mexrail, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of TFM, for $32.7 million and
placed those shares into trust pending STB approval to exercise
common control over KCSR, Gateway Eastern and Tex-Mex. Pending
the STB’s approval, KCS recorded $2.7 million in
losses “Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated
affiliates” representing the Company’s 51% share of
Mexrail’s losses for the period from August 16, 2004
through December 31, 2004. The Company’s management
expects to complete an evaluation of the fair value of the
assets and liabilities of Mexrail in the first quarter of 2005.
The terms of the New Mexrail Stock Purchase Agreement are
substantially similar to the May 9, 2003 Stock Purchase
Agreement, but TFM does not have any right to repurchase the
Mexrail shares sold to KCS and KCS has an option which, if not
exercised on or before October 31, 2005, becomes an
obligation on October 31, 2005, to purchase the remaining
shares of Mexrail owned by TFM at a price of $31.4 million.
The purchase option has been recorded as a related party payable
and noncurrent asset on the balance sheet of KCS at
December 31, 2004. On November 29, 2004, the STB
approved our application for authority to control KCSR, Gateway
Eastern and Tex-Mex which approval became effective on
December 29, 2004. The shares representing 51% ownership of
Mexrail were transferred by the trustee to KCS on
January 1, 2005; accordingly KCS will consolidate Mexrail
beginning January 1, 2005.

The Company has notes receivable of $19.5 million and
$6.1 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, from Tex-Mex related to certain rehabilitation and
maintenance projects. The notes receivable are interest bearing,
$9.0 million at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 3% and
$10.5 million at 5.5%, and are included as investments in
the accompanying balance sheet.

The Company has an account receivable from related parties of
$4.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, from
Tex-Mex related to certain materials and services provided in
the normal course of operations. Total amounts billed to Tex-Mex
were $4.5 million, $4.7 million and $1.9 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Southern
    Capital

In 1996, the Company and GATX Capital Corporation
(“GATX”) completed a transaction for the formation and
financing of a joint venture, Southern Capital, to perform
certain leasing and financing activities. Southern
Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition of
locomotives, rolling stock and other railroad equipment and the
leasing thereof to the Company. The Company holds a 50% interest
in Southern Capital, which it accounts for using the equity
method of accounting.

Concurrent with the formation of this joint venture, the Company
entered into operating leases with Southern Capital for
substantially all the locomotives and rolling stock contributed
or sold to Southern Capital at rental rates which management
believes reflected market conditions at that time. Southern
Capital has acquired additional equipment since its inception,
all of which is leased to KCSR. KCSR paid Southern Capital
$32.5 million, $35.3 million and $28.7 million
under these operating leases in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In connection with the formation of Southern
Capital, the Company received cash that exceeded the net book
value of assets contributed to the joint venture by
approximately $44.1 million. Accordingly, this excess fair
value over book value is being recognized as a reduction in
lease rental expense over the terms of the leases (approximately
$4.4 million, $4.5 million and $4.5 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively). During 2004, the Company
received cash dividends of $8.8 million from Southern
Capital. No dividends were received from Southern Capital during
2003 or 2002.

During 2004, Southern Capital recorded a gain of approximately
$6.0 million related to the sale of locomotives to KCSR.
For purposes of recording its share of Southern Capital
earnings, the Company has



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded its share of the gain as a reduction to the cost basis
of the equipment acquired. As a result, the Company will
recognize its equity in the gain over the remaining depreciable
life of the locomotives as a reduction of depreciation expense.

During 2001, Southern Capital refinanced its five-year credit
facility, which was scheduled to mature on October 19,
2001, with a one-year bridge loan for $201 million. On
June 25, 2002, Southern Capital refinanced the outstanding
balance of this bridge loan through the issuance of
approximately $167.6 million of 5.7% pass through trust
certificates and proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. Of
this amount, $104.0 million is secured by all of the
locomotives and rolling stock owned by Southern Capital (other
than the 50 locomotives, which were sold, as discussed below)
and rental payments payable by KCSR under the operating and
financing leases of the equipment owned by Southern Capital.
Payments of interest and principal of the pass through trust
certificates, which are due semi-annually on June 30 and
December 30 commencing on December 30, 2002 and ending
on June 30, 2022, are insured under a financial guarantee
insurance policy by MBIA Insurance Corporation
(“MBIA”). KCSR leases or subleases all of the
equipment securing the pass through certificates.

The remaining amount of pass through trust certificates,
approximately $63.6 million was assigned to General
Electric Corporation (“GE”), the buyer of the 50
locomotives, and is secured by the sold locomotives. Southern
Capital does not have the option, nor is it obligated to
repurchase or redeem the lease receivable or related equipment
on or prior to the expiration of the lease agreement entered
into with KCSR at the time of the sale. Southern Capital does
not guarantee the lease payments of KCSR and has no obligation
to make such payments if KCSR should fail to do so. In the event
of a default by KCSR, a third party insurance company, MBIA,
guarantees the outstanding debt and may seize the collateralized
assets, or find a third party lessee to continue making the
rental payments to satisfy the debt requirements.

Panama Canal Railway
    Company

In January 1998, the Republic of Panama awarded PCRC, a joint
venture between KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc.
(“Mi-Jack”), the concession to reconstruct and operate
the Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to
the Panama Canal, which provides international shippers with a
railway transportation option to complement the Panama Canal.
The Panama Canal Railway, which traces its origins back to the
mid 1800’s, is a north-south railroad traversing the Panama
isthmus between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The railroad
has been reconstructed and it resumed freight operations on
December 1, 2001. Panarail operates and promotes commuter
and tourist passenger service over the Panama Canal Railway.
Passenger service started during July 2001.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has invested
approximately $23.9 million toward the reconstruction and
operations of the Panama Canal Railway. This investment is
comprised of $12.9 million of equity and $11.0 million
of subordinated loans. These loans carry a 10% interest rate and
are payable on demand, subject to certain restrictions.

In November 1999, PCRC completed the financing arrangements for
this project with the International Finance Corporation
(“IFC”), a member of the World Bank Group. The
financing is comprised of a $5 million investment by IFC
and senior loans through IFC in an aggregate amount of
$39.4 million. Additionally, PCRC has $5.8 million of
equipment loans and other capital leases totaling
$2.0 million. IFC’s investment of $5 million in
PCRC is comprised of non-voting preferred shares which pay a 10%
cumulative dividend. On March 28, 2005, PCRC and the IFC
finalized an agreement whereby PCRC would redeem the shares
subscribed and owned by IFC pursuant to the IFC Subscription.
Under the agreement, PCRC will pay to the IFC
$10.5 million. These shares have a recorded value of
$5.0 million and approximately $2.6 million in accrued
unpaid dividends. When the transaction is completed, PCRC will
record an additional cost of approximately $2.9 million to
reflect the premium paid to IFC and, as a result, KCS expects to
record its share



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of this cost of approximately $1.5 million in recording its
equity in earnings of PCRC in the first quarter of 2005.

Under the terms of the loan agreement with IFC, the Company is a
guarantor for up to $5.6 million of the associated debt.
Also if PCRC terminates the concession contract without
IFC’s consent, the Company is a guarantor for up to 50% of
the outstanding senior loans. The Company is also a guarantor
for up to $1.4 million of the equipment loans and
approximately $100,000 relating to the other capital leases, and
has issued an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of
$1.5 million to fulfill the Company’s 50% guarantee of
a $2.9 million equipment loan. The cost of the
reconstruction totaled approximately $80 million.

The Company, Grupo TFM, and certain of their affiliates entered
into an agreement on February 27, 2002 with TFM to sell to
TFM all of the common stock of Mexrail. The sale closed on
March 27, 2002. Accordingly for the period from
January 1, 2004 through July 31, 2004, and for years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the results of Mexrail
are consolidated into the results of Grupo TFM.

The effects of foreign currency transactions and capitalized
interest prior to June 23, 1997, which are not recorded on
Grupo TFM’s books, result in the difference between the
carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Grupo TFM
and the underlying equity in net assets. Additionally, the
purchase by TFM of the Mexican government’s former 24.6%
interest in Grupo TFM resulted in a reduction of Grupo
TFM’s stockholder’s equity as the purchased shares
from the Mexican government were recorded as treasury shares at
Grupo TFM. The Company invested no funds in this transaction,
however, and, therefore, it did not have an impact on the
Company’s investment in Grupo TFM. As a result, the
difference between the Company’s equity in net assets of
Grupo TFM and its underlying investment arising as a result of
this transaction is being amortized against the Company’s
equity in earnings from Grupo TFM over a 33 year period,
which was the estimate of the average remaining useful life of
Grupo TFM’s concession assets.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The deferred income tax calculations for Grupo TFM are
significantly impacted by fluctuations in the relative value of
the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar and the rate of
Mexican inflation, and can result in significant variability in
the amount of equity earnings (losses) reported by the Company.

Foreign Exchange Matters.

In connection with the
Company’s investment in Grupo TFM, matters arise with
respect to financial accounting and reporting for foreign
currency transactions and for translating foreign currency
financial statements into U.S. dollars. The Company follows
the requirements outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation”
(“SFAS 52”), and related authoritative guidance.
Grupo TFM uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
Equity earnings (losses) from Grupo TFM included in the
Company’s results of operations reflect the Company’s
share of any such translation gains and losses that Grupo TFM
records in the process of translating certain transactions from
Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars.

The Company continues to evaluate existing alternatives with
respect to utilizing foreign currency instruments to hedge its
U.S. dollar investment in Grupo TFM as market conditions
change or exchange rates fluctuate. At December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company had no outstanding foreign currency
hedging instruments.

Results of the Company’s investment in Grupo TFM are
reported under U.S. GAAP, while Grupo TFM reports its
financial results under International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”). Because the Company is required to
report its equity earnings (losses) in Grupo TFM under
U.S. GAAP and Grupo TFM reports under IFRS, differences in
deferred income tax calculations and the classification of
certain operating expense categories occur. The deferred income
tax calculations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in
the relative value of the Mexican peso versus the
U.S. dollar and the rate of Mexican inflation, and can
result in significant variability in the amount of equity
earnings (losses) reported by the Company.

Amended 2004 Senior Secured Credit Facility.

During March
2004, the Company used cash on hand to repay approximately
$98.5 million of debt relating to the Company’s former
credit facility (“KCS Credit Facility”). On
March 30, 2004, the Company closed on a new credit facility
(“2004 Credit Facility”). The 2004 Credit Facility
consists of a $100 million revolving credit facility
(“2004 Revolving Credit Facility”) maturing on
March 30, 2007 and a $150 million Term B loan facility
(“Term B Loan Facility”) maturing on
March 30, 2008. The Term B Loan Facility was fully
funded on the closing date and the proceeds are expected to be
used to pay transaction costs and for other general corporate
purposes, including additional investments in the Company’s
Mexican affiliates. Up to $25.0 million of the 2004
Revolving Credit Facility is available for letters of credit and
up to $15 million is available for swing line loans. The
proceeds from future borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit
Facility may be used for working capital and for general
corporate purposes, including additional investments in the
Company’s Mexican affiliates. The letters of credit may be
used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 2004
Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the
Company’s assets and are guaranteed by the majority of its
subsidiaries.

The Term B Loan Facility and the 2004 Revolving Credit
Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin or at an
alternative base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable
margin for the Term B Loan facility was 200 basis points
over LIBOR for LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin for the
2004 Revolving Credit Facility was set at 2.25% for LIBOR
borrowings for the first six months and thereafter is based on
the Company’s leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of the
Company’s total debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding
the undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and
certain other non-cash charges) for the prior four fiscal
quarters).

The 2004 Credit Facility requires the payment of a commitment
fee of 0.50% per annum to the lenders on the average daily,
unused amount of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility.
Additionally, a fee equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR
priced borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility will
be paid on any letter of credit issued under the 2004 Revolving
Credit Facility.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The 2004 Credit Facility contains certain provisions, covenants
and restrictions customary for this type of debt and for
borrowers with a similar credit rating. These provisions
include, among others, restrictions on the Company’s
ability and its subsidiaries ability to 1) incur additional
debt or liens; 2) enter into sale and leaseback
transactions; 3) merge or consolidate with another entity;
4) sell assets; 5) enter into certain transactions
with affiliates; 6) make investments, loans, advances,
guarantees or acquisitions; 7) make certain restricted payments,
including dividends, or make certain payments on other
indebtedness; or 8) make capital expenditures in excess of
allowed amounts. In addition, the Company is required to comply
with certain financial ratios, including minimum interest
expense coverage and leverage ratios. The 2004 Credit Facility
also contains certain customary events of default. These
covenants, along with other provisions, could restrict maximum
utilization of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. At
December 31, 2004, KCS had available borrowing under the
Revolving Credit Facility in the full amount of
$100 million.

On December 22, 2004, the Company entered into an amendment
and waiver of the 2004 Credit Facility. The credit agreement was
amended to, among other things, increase the Term B
Loan Facility by $100,000,000 to a total amount outstanding
at December 31, 2004 of $249.2 million and decrease
the borrowing spread by 25 basis points to 175 basis
points for LIBOR borrowings. In addition, a waiver was granted
that would allow KCSR to make an additional $55 million of
capital expenditures during 2004 and 2005. The maturity date of
the credit agreement was unchanged.

Approximately $3.8 million of debt issuance costs related
to the 2004 Credit Facility (including the amendments) have been
deferred and are being amortized over the respective terms of
the loans. Debt retirement costs of approximately
$4.2 million associated with the previous revolving credit
facility and term loan were recorded during the quarter ended
March 31, 2004.

lease obligations. The equipment, which has been pledged as
collateral for the related indebtedness, has an original cost of
$132.0 million and a net book value of $59.0 million.

Other Agreements, Guarantees, Provisions and
Restrictions.

The Company has debt agreements containing
restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, advances and transfers
of assets, and sale and leaseback transactions, as well as
requiring compliance with various financial covenants. At
December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with the
provisions and restrictions of these agreements. Because of
certain financial covenants contained in the debt agreements,
however, maximum utilization of the Company’s available
line of credit may be restricted.

Change in Control Provisions.

Certain loan agreements and
debt instruments entered into or guaranteed by the Company and
its subsidiaries provide for default in the event of a specified
change in control of the Company or particular subsidiaries of
the Company.

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
reported on the Company’s income tax return, and deferred
tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by
the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
differences reverse. Valuation allowances are used to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be
realized.

Tax Rates.

Differences between the Company’s
effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax
statutory rates of 35% are as follows

(in millions):

Other, net for 2004 includes certain adjustments of prior year
provision estimates resulting in a $1.1 million increase in
tax expense.

Difference Attributable to Grupo TFM Investment.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s book basis exceeded
the tax basis of its investment in Grupo TFM by
$90.1 million. The Company has not provided a deferred
income tax liability for the income taxes, if any, which might
become payable on the realization of this basis difference
because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest in Grupo
TFM the financial accounting earnings which gave rise to the
basis differential. Moreover, the Company has no other plans to
realize this basis differential by a sale of its investment in
Grupo TFM. If the Company were to realize this basis difference
in the future by a receipt of dividends or the sale of its
interest in Grupo TFM, as of December 31, 2004 the Company
would incur gross federal income taxes of $31.5 million,
which might be partially or fully offset by Mexican income taxes
and could be available to reduce federal income taxes at such
time.

Tax Carryovers.

In the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, the Company generated both federal and state net
operating losses. The 2003 losses are carried forward
20 years for federal and from 5 to 20 years for state.
The 2002 federal loss was carried back to 2000, whereas the
state losses have been carried forward.

Both the federal and state loss carryovers are analyzed each
year to determine the likelihood of realization. The federal
loss carryover at December 31, 2004 is approximately
$0.9 million and will expire in 2023. The Company believes
the Federal loss carryover is more likely than not to be
realized.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and
separately filed tax filings from as early as 1990. The loss
carryovers may expire as early as December 31, 2005 and as
late as December 31, 2024. The state loss carryover at
December 31, 2004 is $497.8 million (about
$16.2 million of tax), of which it is expected that
$271.4 million (about $8.8 million of tax) will expire
without utilization, leaving $226.4 million (about
$7.4 million of tax) expected to be realized. Management
believes that deferred tax assets, net of the valuation
allowance, will be ultimately realized.

Internal Revenue Service reviews.

The IRS recently
concluded reviews of the 1990-1996 tax years. The Company
received $21.6 million in tax refunds ($37.6 million
including interest) from adjustments arising in those years. The
Company recognized interest income in the financial statements
as an increase of $10.3 million to other income, an
increase in deferred taxes of $21.5 million and an increase
of $6.0 million in other liabilities (primarily interest
and amounts due to former affiliates) offset by an increase in
current tax expense of $0.2 million. The federal statute of
limitations has closed for years prior to 1997. The IRS is
currently in the process of reviewing the consolidated federal
income tax returns for the years 1997 through 1999. In addition,
other taxing authorities are currently reviewing the years 2000
through 2003. The Company

believes that adequate provision has been made for any
adjustment (taxes and interest) that might be assessed for all
open years.

Stock Option Plans.

The Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended
and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan (as amended
and restated effective May 5, 2004) provides for the
granting of options to purchase up to 16.0 million shares
of the Company’s common stock by officers and other
designated employees. Options have been granted under this plan
at 100% of the average market price of the Company’s stock
on the date of grant and generally may not be exercised sooner
than one year or longer than ten years following the date of the
grant, except that options outstanding with limited rights
(“LRs”) or limited stock appreciation rights
(“LSARs”), become immediately exercisable upon certain
defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the
Company. The plan includes provisions for stock appreciation
rights, LRs and LSARs. All outstanding options include LSARs,
except for options granted to non-employee Directors prior to
1999.

For purposes of computing the pro forma effects of option grants
under the fair value accounting method prescribed by
SFAS 123, the fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using a version of the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following assumptions were used for the
various grants depending on the date of grant, nature of vesting
and term of option:




Dividend Yield

Expected Volatility

2.16% to 3.88%

Expected Life

3 years

For the three years ended December 31, 2004, changes in
these assumptions have resulted from changes in the risk free
rate due to changing market conditions and changes in expected
volatility that reflect an average of the most recent three
years volatility of KCS common stock.

Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”), established in 1977, provides substantially
all full-time employees of the Company, certain subsidiaries and
certain other affiliated entities, with the right to subscribe
to an aggregate of 11.4 million shares of common stock. For
offerings under the Fifteenth and Fourteenth Offerings of the
ESPP, the purchase price for shares were 85% of the average
market price on either the exercise date or the offering date,
whichever was lower, but in no event less than the par value of
the shares. For offerings under the Sixteenth Offering, the
purchase prices for shares was 90% of the average market price
on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever was
lower, but in no event

At December 31, 2004, there were approximately

For purposes of computing the pro forma effects of
employees’ purchase rights under the fair value accounting
method prescribed by SFAS 123, the fair value of the
offerings under the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using
a version of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
following weighted-average assumptions were used for the
Sixteenth, Fifteenth and Fourteenth Offerings, respectively:
i) dividend yield of 0.00%, 0.00% and 0.00%; ii) expected
volatility of 27%, 35% and 36%; iii) risk-free interest rate of
2.85%, 1.26% and 2.22%; and iv) expected life of one year. The
weighted-average fair value of purchase rights granted under the
Sixteenth, Fifteenth and Fourteenth Offerings of the ESPP were
$2.96, $2.95 and $3.00, respectively.

Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock.

On May 5, 2003, the Company completed the sale
of $200 million of Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Convertible Preferred
Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $500 per
share in a private offering. The Convertible Preferred Stock
offering was made only by means of an offering memorandum
pursuant to Rule 144A. Dividends on the Convertible
Preferred Stock are cumulative and are payable quarterly at an
annual rate of 4.25% of the liquidation preference, when, as and
if declared by the Company’s board of directors.
Accumulated unpaid dividends will accumulate dividends at the
same rate as dividends accumulate on the Convertible Preferred
Stock. Each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock will be
convertible, under certain conditions, and subject to adjustment
under certain conditions, into 33.4728 shares of the
Company’s common stock. On or after May 20, 2008, the
Company will have the option to redeem any or all of the
Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to certain conditions.
Under certain circumstances, at the option of the holders of the
Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company may be required to
purchase shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock from the
holders. The Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable at the
option of a holder only in the event of a “fundamental
change,” which is defined as “any transaction or event
(whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tender
offer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) in connection with which all or
substantially all of the Company’s common stock is
exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes
solely the right to receive common stock that is not listed on a
United States national securities exchange or approved for
quotation on the Nasdaq National



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Market or similar system. The practical effect of this provision
is to limit the Company’s ability to eliminate a
holder’s ability to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock
into common shares of a publicly traded security through a
merger or consolidation transaction. In no other circumstances
is the Company potentially obligated to redeem the Convertible
Preferred Stock for cash. Accordingly, since the Company is in a
position to control whether the Company experiences a
“fundamental change,” the Convertible Preferred Stock
is classified as permanent equity capital.

On August, 1, 2003, KCS filed a Form S-3 Registration
Statement with the SEC to register for resale by the holders the
Convertible Preferred Stock and the common stock into which such
preferred stock may be converted. On October 24, 2003, this
Registration Statement, as amended, was declared effective by
the SEC. KCS has filed, and will continue to file,
post-effective amendments to this Registration Statement as
required by applicable rules and regulations. KCS will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of the securities under this
Registration Statement, as amended.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

On September 19, 1995, the
Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of the
Company’s common stock, to the stockholders of record on
October  12, 1995. Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from the Company 1/1,000th of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock or in some circumstances, common
stock, other securities, cash or other assets as the case may
be, at a price of $210 per share, subject to adjustment.

The Rights, which are automatically attached to the common
stock, are not exercisable or transferable apart from the common
stock until the tenth calendar day following the earlier to
occur of (unless extended by the Board of Directors and subject
to the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights):
(i) the date of a public announcement that an acquiring
person acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 20 percent or more of the outstanding shares
of the common stock of the Company (or 15 percent in the
case that such person is considered an “adverse
person”), or (ii) the commencement or announcement of
an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in an acquiring person beneficially owning
20 percent or more of such outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company (or 15 percent in the case that such
person is considered an “adverse person”). Until
exercised, the Rights will have no rights as a stockholder of
the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or
to receive dividends. In connection with certain business
combinations resulting in the acquisition of the Company or
dispositions of more than 50% of Company assets or earnings
power, each Right shall thereafter have the right to receive,
upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of
the Right, that number of shares of the highest priority voting
securities of the acquiring company (or certain of its
affiliates) that at the time of such transaction would have a
market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The
Rights expire on October 12, 2005, unless earlier redeemed
by the Company as described below. In conjunction with the
Acquisition, KCS and the Rights Agent, will amend the Rights
Agreement to, among other things, amend the definition of
“Acquiring Person” so that the Acquisition will not
trigger the rights under the Rights Agreement, dated
September 19, 1995.

At any time prior to the tenth calendar day after the first date
after the public announcement that an acquiring person has
acquired beneficial ownership of 20 percent (or
15 percent in some instances) or more of the outstanding
shares of the common stock of the Company, the Company may
redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of
$0.005 per Right. In addition, the Company’s right of
redemption may be reinstated following an inadvertent trigger of
the Rights (as determined by the Board) if an acquiring person
reduces its beneficial ownership to 10 percent or less of
the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company in a
transaction or series of transactions not involving the Company.

The Series A Preferred shares purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will have a cumulative quarterly dividend rate set by
the Board of Directors or equal to 1,000 times the dividend
declared on the common stock for such quarter. Each share will
have the voting rights of one vote on all matters voted at a
meeting of the stockholders for each 1/1,000th share of
preferred stock held by such stockholder. In the event of any
merger,



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consolidation or other transaction in which the common shares
are exchanged, each Series A Preferred share will be
entitled to receive an amount equal to 1,000 times the amount to
be received per common share. In the event of liquidation, the
holders of Series A Preferred shares will be entitled to
receive $1,000 per share or an amount per share equal to
1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to
holders of common stock. The shares will not be redeemable. The
vote of holders of a majority of the Series A Preferred
shares, voting together as a class, will be required for any
amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation
that would materially and adversely alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of such shares.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and certain of
its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with employees
whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a change in
control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock options
become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
event of a specified change in control of the Company or
subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts at December 31, 2004
were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at the time
of any such change in control, the most significant factor of
which would be the highest price paid for KCS common stock by a
party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Note 8.     Profit Sharing
and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains various plans for the benefit of its
employees as described below. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company expensed
$1.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.4 million,
respectively, related to the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan
(the “401(k) Plan”). During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company did not recognize any expense relative to profit sharing
or the ESOP.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The 401(k) Plan permits
participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant
to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and also
allows employees to direct their profit sharing accounts into
selected investments. The Company matched employee 401(k)
contributions up to a maximum of 5% of compensation in 2004 and
2003 and 3% of compensation during 2002. Qualified profit
sharing plans are maintained for most employees not included in
collective bargaining agreements. Contributions by the Company
and its subsidiaries are made at the discretion of the Board of
Directors of KCS in amounts not to exceed the maximum allowable
for federal income tax purposes.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

KCS established the ESOP
for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
KCS contributions to the ESOP are based on a percentage of wages
earned by eligible employees. Contributions and percentages are
determined by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the
Board of Directors.

Other Postretirement Benefits.

The Company provides
certain medical, life and other postretirement benefits other
than pensions to its retirees. The medical and life plans are
available to employees not covered under collective bargaining
arrangements, who have attained age 60 and rendered ten
years of service. Individuals employed as of December 31,
1992 were excluded from a specific service requirement. The
medical plan is contributory and provides benefits for retirees,
their covered dependents and beneficiaries. The medical plan
provides for an annual adjustment of retiree contributions, and
also contains, depending on the plan coverage selected, certain
deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance and coordination with
Medicare. Certain management employees also maintain their
status under a collective bargaining agreement, which permits
them access to postretirement medical under the multiemployer
plan described below. Assumptions related to medical
postretirement benefits plan were adjusted in 2004 to reflect
the expected participation of these individuals in the
multiemployer plan. The life insurance plan is non-contributory
and covers retirees only. The Company’s policy, in most
cases, is to fund benefits payable under these plans as the
obligations



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

become due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds
held in a life insurance company) exist with respect to life
insurance benefits. A life insurance company holds these assets
and the Company receives an investment return on these assets
based on the six-month Treasury Bill rate plus 25 basis
points.

Based upon current regulations, the Company’s plans are
actuarially equivalent to Medicare part D benefits; however,
provisions within the plans contain retiree cost sharing
features, which make any potential benefit to KCS from the
subsidy entitlement unlikely to be material.

The Gateway Western benefit plans are slightly different from
those of the Company and other subsidiaries. Gateway Western
provides contributory health, dental and life insurance benefits
to these remaining employees and retirees.

The Company uses January 1 as the measurement date for its
postretirement benefit obligations.

Assumptions

The following assumptions were used to determine postretirement
obligations and net periodic benefit costs for the years ended
December 31:



Annual increase in CPI

2.50

%

2.25

%

Expected rate of return on life insurance plan assets

6.25

6.50

Discount rate

5.65

6.00

The Company’s health care costs, excluding former Gateway
Western employees and certain former employees of the MidSouth,
are limited to the increase in the Consumer Price Index
(“CPI”) with a maximum annual increase of 5%.
Accordingly, health care costs in excess of the CPI limit will
be borne by the plan participants, and therefore assumptions
regarding health care cost trend rates are not applicable. The
expected rate of return on life insurance plan assets is the
return, over the period that benefits are expected to be paid.
In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the
Company considered forward looking information and historical
returns for similar investments.

The assumed annual rate of increase in health care costs for
Gateway Western employees and retirees under the Gateway Western
plan is as follows:



Health care cost trend assumed for next year

10.00

%

10.25

%

Ultimate trend rate

5.00

5.25

Year that rate reaches the ultimate trend rate



An increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend
rates by one percent in 2004, 2003 and 2002 would not have a
significant impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation or on the aggregate of the service and interest
components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost.

by the Company were ($1.0) million, $0.2 million and
$1.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
amortization of unrecognized prior service cost was not material
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Cash Flows

During 2005, the Company expects to contribute approximately
$0.9 million to its other post retirement benefit plans in
the form of benefit payments.

Multi-employer Plan

Under collective bargaining agreements, KCSR participates in a
multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits to
eligible union employees and certain retirees. Premiums under
this plan are expensed as incurred and were $1.9 million,
$1.7 million and $1.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Based on existing rates, premium amounts are not
expected to change substantially in 2005 compared to 2004.

Note 9.     Commitments and
Contingencies

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal
proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are of an
ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
current and former employees for job related injuries and by
third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. We
aggressively defend these matters and have established liability
reserves which management believes are adequate to cover
expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the
outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of the
Company’s management, such proceedings and actions should
not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Stilwell Tax Dispute.

On October 15, 2004, KCS and
Janus Capital Group Inc. (“Janus”), formerly Stilwell
Financial Inc. (“Stilwell”), finalized a settlement
agreement (“Release”), effecting settlement of all
disputes which arose on or before August 13, 2004 relating
to the spin-off of Stilwell from KCS on July 12, 2000 (the
“Spin-off”). As part of the settlement, all
arbitration claims filed by the parties with the American
Arbitration Association were dismissed. This claim involved the
entitlement to compensation expense deductions for federal
income tax purposes, associated with the exercise of certain
stock options issued by Stilwell (the “Substituted
Options”) in connection with the Spin-off. Prior to the
settlement, amounts related to the tax benefits of exercises of
the Substituted Options were recorded as a noncurrent liability
in the consolidated financial statements pending resolution of
this dispute. As a result of this settlement, the Company
reclassified approximately $27.1 million in tax benefits
from previous exercises of the Substituted Options to additional
paid in capital on the balance sheet. As previously disclosed,
the settlement had no adverse consequences to the Company.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s operations
are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. The major environmental laws to which the
Company is subject, include, among others, the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), the
Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
CERCLA can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and
investigation costs, without regard to fault or legality of the
original conduct, on current and predecessor owners and
operators of a site, as well as those who generate, or arrange
for the



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

disposal of, hazardous substances. The Company does not foresee
that compliance with the requirements imposed by the
environmental legislation will impair its competitive capability
or result in any material additional capital expenditures,
operating or maintenance costs.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
chemicals industry, KCSR transports hazardous materials and has
a professional team available to respond and handle
environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
materials. Additionally, the Company is a partner in the
Responsible Care® program and, as a result, has initiated
certain additional environmental, health and safety programs.
KCSR performs ongoing reviews and evaluations of the various
environmental programs and issues within the Company’s
operations, and, as necessary, takes actions to limit the
Company’s exposure to potential liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
investigation and cleanup of contaminants, claims alleging
personal injury, or property damage as the result of exposures
to, or release of, hazardous substances. Although the Company is
responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at
several locations, based on currently available information, the
Company does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
collectively, to have a material impact on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. In the event that
the Company becomes subject to more stringent cleanup
requirements at these sites, discovers additional contamination,
or becomes subject to related personal or property damage
claims, the Company could incur material costs in connection
with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
costs related to past activities when the Company’s
obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.

Panama Canal Railway Company.

Under certain limited
conditions, the Company is a guarantor for up to
$5.6 million of cash deficiencies associated with the
operations of PCRC. In addition, the Company is a guarantor for
up to $3.0 million of equipment loans. Further, if the
Company or its partner terminate the concession contract without
the consent of IFC, the Company is a guarantor for up to 50% of
the outstanding senior loans. See Note 3.

Commitment for Locomotive Purchase.

On February 15,
2005, KCSR entered into a purchase agreement with the
Electro-Motive Division of General Motors Corporation
(GM) to purchase new SD70ACe locomotives at a cost of
approximately $55 million. KCSR expects the locomotives to
be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2005. If KCSR fails to
purchase the locomotives, GM is permitted to cancel the purchase
agreement and KCSR must pay specified cancellation charges.

Heavener Fueling Facility and Pipeline.

The Company has
entered into an agreement to transport locomotive diesel fuel
via pipeline into the Company’s fuel facility in Heavener,
Oklahoma. The pipeline was completed and placed in service in
May 2004. The contract provides that the Company will pay to the
supplier transportation fees based on published tariff rates per
barrel. The contract further requires that for a period of ten
years after the pipeline is placed in service, the fees will be
at least $1.5 million per year.

Note 10.     Derivative
Instruments and Purchase Commitments

Derivative Instruments.

The Company does not engage in
the trading of derivatives. The Company’s objective for
using derivative instruments is to manage its fuel price risk
and mitigate the impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. In
general, the Company enters into derivative transactions in
limited situations

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

based on management’s assessment of current market
conditions and perceived risks. Management intends to respond to
evolving business and market conditions in order to manage risks
and exposures associated with the Company’s various
operations, and in doing so, may enter into such transactions
more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions

At December 31, 2004, the Company was a party to one fuel
swap agreement for a notional amount of approximately
2.5 million gallons of fuel. Under the terms of this swap,
the Company receives a variable price based upon an average of
the spot prices calculated on a monthly basis as reported
through a petroleum price reporting service and pays a fixed
price determined at the time the Company entered into the swap
transaction. The variable price the Company is receiving is
approximately equal to the price the Company is paying in the
market for locomotive fuel. By entering into swap transactions,
the Company is able to fix the cost of fuel for the notional
amount of gallons hedged.

A summary of the swap agreement to which KCSR was a party as of
December 31, 2004 follows:

Trade Dates

Notional Amount

Fixed pay per gallon

Expiration Date

October 31, 2003

2.5 million gallons

68.0¢

December 31, 2005

Cash settlements of this swap occur on a monthly basis on the
fifth business day of the month following the month for which
the settlement is calculated. As of December 31, 2004, the
fair market value of the benefit of the swap was
$1.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, KCSR consumed 59.2 million,
55.4 million and 55.3 million gallons of fuel,
respectively. Fuel hedging transactions, including fuel swaps as
well as forward purchase commitments, resulted in a decrease in
fuel expense of $3.0 million, $1.1 million, and
$0.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Southern Capital

The Company records adjustments to its stockholders’ equity
(accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) for its portion
of the adjustment to the fair value of derivative transactions
to which Southern Capital was a participant. The Company also
adjusts its investment in Southern Capital by the change in the
fair value of these derivative instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a reduction to its
stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive loss) of
approximately $0.3 million for its portion of the amount
recorded by Southern Capital for the adjustment to the fair
value of its interest rate swap transactions. The Company also
reduced its investment in Southern Capital by the same amount.

During 2002, in conjunction with the refinancing of its debt,
Southern Capital terminated these interest rate swap
transactions. As a result, Southern Capital is amortizing the
balance of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into
interest expense over the former remaining life of the interest
rate swap transactions. The Company is recording the impact of
this charge through a related reduction in equity earnings from
Southern Capital and is amortizing the related accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) balance to its investment in
Southern Capital. During the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company recorded related amortization of
$0.5 million, $1.2 million and $0.7 million,
respectively.
