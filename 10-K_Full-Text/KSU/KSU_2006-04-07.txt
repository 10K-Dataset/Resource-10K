Part I

Item 1.

Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern (“we”, “our”,
“KCS”, “the Company” or “the
Registrant”), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company
with principal operations in rail transportation.

We are a holding company that owns and operates uniquely
positioned domestic and international rail operations in North
America that are strategically focused on the growing
north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and
industrial markets in the central U.S. with major
industrial cities in Mexico. The Kansas City Southern Railway
Company (“KCSR”), which was founded in 1887, is one of
seven Class I railroads. KCSR serves a ten-state region in
the Midwest and southern parts of the U.S. and has the shortest
north/south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri and several
key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas.

We control and own all of the stock of Kansas City Southern de
México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”), formerly known as
TFM, S.A. de C.V., through our wholly owned subsidiary, Grupo
Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo
TFM”). On December 2, 2005, the name of KCSM was
formally changed to Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de
C.V. KCSM operates a primary commercial corridor of the Mexican
railroad system and has as its core route a key portion of the
shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico City and
Laredo, Texas. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal
industrial cities and three of its major shipping ports.
KCSM’s rail lines are the only ones that serve Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas, the largest rail freight interchange point
between the U.S. and Mexico. KCSM, through its concession with
the Mexican government (the “Concession”), has the
right to control and operate the southern half of the
rail-bridge at Nuevo Laredo.

We own, directly and indirectly, through our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, 100% of Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”).
Mexrail owns 100% of Texas Mexican Railway Company
(“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex operates a

157-mile

rail line
extending from Laredo to the port city of Corpus Christi, Texas
and connects the operations of KCSR with KCSM. Tex-Mex connects
with KCSM at the U.S./ Mexico border at Laredo and connects to
KCSR through trackage rights at Beaumont, Texas. Through our
ownership in Mexrail, we own the northern half of the
rail-bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River
between the U.S. and Mexico. Laredo is a principal international
gateway through which more than 50% of all rail and truck
traffic between the U.S. and Mexico crosses the border.

Our rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex) extends from the
Midwest and Southeastern portions of the U.S. south into
Mexico and connects with all other Class I railroads
providing shippers with an effective alternative to other
railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the
southeastern and southwestern U.S. through less congested
interchange hubs.

We also own 50% of the stock of the Panama Canal Railway Company
(“PCRC”), which holds the concession to operate a

47-mile

coast-to

-coast railroad
located adjacent to the Panama Canal. The railroad handles
containers in freight service across the isthmus. Panarail
Tourism Company (“Panarail”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of PCRC, operates commuter and tourist railway
services over the lines of the PCRC.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a 50% owned unconsolidated affiliate that leases
    locomotives and other rail equipment to KCSR;

•

Transfin Insurance, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated
    captive insurance company, providing property, general liability
    and certain other insurance coverage to KCS and its subsidiaries
    and affiliates;

•

Trans-Serve, Inc., (d/b/a Superior Tie and Timber;
    “ST&T”), a wholly-owned and consolidated operator
    of a railroad wood tie treating facility; and



•

PABTEX GP, LLC (“Pabtex”), a wholly-owned and
    consolidated owner of a bulk materials handling facility with
    deep-water access to the Gulf of Mexico at Port Arthur, Texas
    that stores and transfers petroleum coke and soda ash from
    trucks and rail cars to ships, primarily for export.

KCS was organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc., and in 2002 formally changed its name to Kansas City
Southern. KCS, as the holding company, supplies its various
subsidiaries with managerial, legal, tax, financial and
accounting services, in addition to managing other minor
“non-operating” investments.

Further discussion of the Company’s business, including
equipment and business sectors, is incorporated by reference
from Item 2, “Properties.”

OWNED RAIL NETWORK

KCSR

KCSR has the shortest north/south rail route between Kansas City
and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. KCSR’s rail route
includes the Meridian Speedway, linking Meridian, Mississippi
and Dallas, Texas, and the east/west route linking Kansas City
with East St. Louis, Illinois and Springfield, Illinois. In
addition, KCSR has limited haulage rights between Springfield
and Chicago that allow for originating or terminating shipments.
The geographic reach of KCSR provides service to a diverse
customer base that includes electric generating utilities, which
use coal, and a wide range of companies in the chemical and
petroleum, agricultural and mineral, forest products and metals,
and automotive industries.

Eastern railroads and their customers can use our rail network
to bypass the gateways at Chicago, Illinois; St. Louis,
Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee by interchanging with KCSR at
Springfield and East St. Louis and at Meridian and Jackson,
Mississippi. Other railroads connect with our rail network at
Kansas City, Missouri; Birmingham, Alabama; and Shreveport,
Louisiana; and Dallas, Beaumont and Laredo, Texas. KCSR revenues
and net income are dependent on providing reliable service to
customers at competitive rates, the general economic conditions
in the geographic region served and the ability to effectively
compete against other rail carriers and alternative modes of
transportation, such as

over-the

-road truck
transportation and barges. The ability of KCSR to maintain the
roadway in order to provide safe and efficient transportation
service is important to its ongoing viability as a rail carrier.
Additionally, cost containment is important in maintaining a
competitive market position, particularly with respect to
employee costs, as approximately 82% of KCSR’s employees
are covered under various collective bargaining agreements.



Mexrail

On August 16, 2004, KCS entered into an agreement with KCSM
to purchase Mexrail shares representing 51% ownership of Mexrail
for approximately $32.7 million. Mexrail owns all of the
shares of Tex-Mex. The Mexrail shares were placed in a voting
trust pending regulatory approval by the Surface Transportation
Board (“STB”) of KCS’s common control of Tex-Mex,
KCSR and the Gateway Eastern Railway Company (“Gateway
Eastern”). On November 29, 2004, the STB approved
KCS’s application for authority to control Tex-Mex and the
U.S. portion of the International Rail Bridge at Laredo.
That authority became final on December 29, 2004. On
January 1, 2005, the shares representing 51% of Mexrail
were released from the voting trust to KCS, and KCS took control
of Tex-Mex. Through its acquisition of KCSM, the Company
controls 100% of the shares of Mexrail and Tex-Mex.

Tex-Mex connects to KCSR through trackage rights over the rail
lines of the Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”)
between Robstown and Beaumont, and Texas. These trackage rights
were granted pursuant to a 1996 STB decision and have an initial
term of 99 years.

KCSR is in the process of adopting the Tex-Mex stations on the
Tex-Mex line. Effective April 1, 2006, Tex-Mex will cease
engaging in the business of line haul freight operations.
Rather, pursuant to the terms of a trackage agreement between
KCSR and Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex will move KCSR freight trains over
Tex-Mex’s rail lines using TexMex crews. As part of this
change in Tex-Mex’s operations, Tex-Mex will assign its
trackage agreements with UP and Houston Belt & Terminal
to KCSR.

On March 12, 2001, Tex-Mex purchased from UP a line of
railroad

right-of

-way
extending 84.5 miles between Rosenberg, Texas and Victoria,
Texas, and UP granted Tex-Mex trackage rights to access the line
from the existing trackage rights. The line is not in service,
but extensive reconstruction is being planned. Once
reconstruction of the line is completed, Tex-Mex will be able to
shorten its existing route between Corpus Christi and Houston,
Texas by over 70 miles.

KCSM

In December 1995, we entered into a joint venture agreement with
Transportación Marítima Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.,
currently known as Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”) to, among
other things, provide for participation in the privatization of
the Mexican national railway system and to promote the movement
of rail traffic over Tex-Mex, KCSM and KCSR. Pursuant to written
notice given by TMM, and in accordance with its terms, the joint
venture agreement was terminated on December 1, 2003.

In 1997, we invested $298 million to obtain a 36.9%
interest in Grupo TFM, the company formed by KCS and TMM under
the joint venture agreement for the purpose of participating in
the privatization of the Mexican national railway system. At the
time that Grupo TFM purchased 80% of the shares of KCSM, TMM,
the largest shareholder of Grupo TFM, owned 38.5% of Grupo TFM
and the Mexican government owned the remaining 24.6% of Grupo
TFM. As more fully described in “Note 3 —
Investments and Acquisitions,” included under Part II
Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data” of this
Form

10-K

and
incorporated herein by reference, in 2005, we acquired the
remaining ownership interests of Grupo TFM from TMM and the
Mexican government to result in our full ownership and
consolidation of Grupo TFM.

Acquisition of Grupo TFM.

April 1, 2005 — Acquisition Agreement.

On
December 15, 2004, the Company entered into the Amended and
Restated Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition
Agreement”). Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement,
KCS acquired all of TMM’s 48.5% effective interest in Grupo
TFM on April 1, 2005 in exchange for $200.0 million in
cash, 18 million shares of KCS common stock, and two-year
promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $47.0 million
(the “Escrow Notes”), as well as $27.5 million in
transaction costs for a total purchase price of
$594.4 million. The $47.0 million Escrow Notes are
subject to reduction pursuant to the indemnification provisions
of the Acquisition Agreement for certain



potential losses related to breaches of certain representations,
warranties, or covenants in the Acquisition Agreement or claims
relating thereto.

September 12, 2005 — Completion of VAT/ Put
Settlement.

On September 12, 2005, the Company and its
subsidiaries, KCSM and Grupo TFM, along with TMM, entered into a
settlement agreement with the Mexican government, resolving the
controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
government concerning the payment of a value added tax
(“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the obligation
(“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of KCSM owned
by the Mexican government (the “VAT/ Put Settlement”).
As a result of the VAT/ Put Settlement, KCS and its subsidiaries
now own 100% of Grupo TFM and KCSM shares; the potential
obligation of KCS, Grupo TFM and TMM to acquire the Mexican
government’s remaining 20% ownership of KCSM has been
eliminated; and the legal obligation of the Mexican government
to issue the VAT refund to KCSM has been satisfied. There was no
cash exchanged between the parties to the settlement agreement.
In addition, the parties entered into mutual releases of all
existing and potential claims relating to the VAT refund and the
Put obligation, and entered into an agreement to dismiss all of
the existing litigation between the parties. The VAT/ Put
Settlement had two separate impacts — first, the
resolution of a preacquisition contingency related to the
April 1, 2005 transaction and second, KCSM’s
acquisition of the minority interest in KCSM which was held by
the Mexican government.

KCSM holds the Concession, which was awarded by the Mexican
government in 1996, to operate Mexico’s Northeast Rail
Lines (the Northeast Rail Lines are now known as
“KCSM”) for 50 years ending in June 2047. Subject
to certain conditions, KCSM has an option to extend the
Concession for an additional 50 years. The Concession is
subject to certain mandatory trackage rights and is exclusive
until 2027. The Mexican government, however, may revoke
KCSM’s exclusivity after 2017 if it determines that there
is insufficient competition, and may terminate the Concession as
a result of certain conditions or events, including
(1) KCSM’s failure to meet its operating and financial
obligations with regard to the Concession under applicable
Mexican law, (2) a statutory appropriation by the Mexican
government for reasons of public interest and
(3) liquidation or bankruptcy of KCSM. KCSM’s assets
and its rights under the Concession may, under certain
circumstances such as natural disaster, war or other similar
situations, also be seized temporarily by the Mexican government.

Under the Concession, KCSM operates a strategically significant
corridor between Mexico and the U.S., and has as its core route
a key portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway
between Mexico City and Laredo. KCSM’s rail lines are the
only ones that serve Nuevo Laredo, the largest rail freight
exchange point between the U.S. and Mexico. KCSM’s rail
lines connect the most populated and industrialized regions of
Mexico with Mexico’s principal U.S. border railway
gateway at Laredo. In addition, KCSM serves three of
Mexico’s primary seaports at Veracruz and Tampico on the
Gulf of Mexico and Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. KCSM
has the right to operate the rail lines through the Concession,
but does not own the land, roadway or associated structures.
Through KCSR, and its interchanges with other major
U.S. railroads, KCSM provides its customers with access to
an extensive rail network through which they may distribute
their products throughout North America and overseas.

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS

Panama Canal Railway Company

In January 1998, the Republic of Panama awarded PCRC, a joint
venture company formed by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc., the
concession to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway,
a

47-mile

railroad
located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international
shippers with a railway transportation option to complement the
Panama Canal. The Panama Canal Railway, which traces its origins
back to the late 1800s, is a north-south railroad traversing the
Panama isthmus between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The
railroad has been reconstructed and resumed freight operations
in December 2001. While only 47 miles long, management
believes the Panama Canal Railway provides a unique opportunity
to participate in transoceanic shipments as a complement to the
existing Panama Canal traffic. Management believes the potential
for this railroad is in the service of shipping customers who
need to



reposition containers between the ports of Balboa and Colon
without passing through the Canal. In addition, there is demand
for passenger traffic for both commuter and pleasure/tourist
travel. Panarail operates and promotes commuter and tourist
passenger service over the Panama Canal Railway. Passenger
service started during July 2001.

As of December 31, 2005, we have invested approximately
$30.4 million toward the reconstruction and operations of
the Panama Canal Railway. This investment is comprised of
$12.9 million of equity and $17.5 million of
subordinated loans. These loans carry a 10% interest rate and
are payable on demand, subject to certain restrictions.

In November 1999, PCRC completed the financing for the
reconstruction project with the International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”), a member of the World Bank Group.
The IFC’s investment of $5 million in PCRC was
comprised of non-voting preferred shares, which paid a 10%
cumulative dividend. On March 28, 2005, PCRC and the IFC
finalized an agreement whereby PCRC would redeem the shares
subscribed and owned by IFC pursuant to the IFC Subscription.
Under the agreement, PCRC paid to the IFC $10.5 million. At
December 31, 2004, these shares had a recorded value of
$5.0 million and approximately $2.6 million in accrued
unpaid dividends. PCRC recorded an additional cost of
approximately $2.9 million to reflect the premium paid to
IFC and, as a result, KCS recorded its share of this cost of
approximately $1.5 million in recording its equity in
earnings of PCRC in the first quarter of 2005.

Southern Capital

In 1996, KCSR and GATX Capital Corporation (“GATX”)
formed a 50-50 joint venture — Southern
Capital — to perform certain leasing and financing
activities. Southern Capital’s operations consist primarily
of the acquisition of locomotives and other rail equipment and
the leasing thereof to KCSR. Concurrent with the formation of
this joint venture, KCSR entered into operating leases with
Southern Capital for substantially all the locomotives and
rolling stock that KCSR contributed or sold to Southern Capital
at the time of formation of the joint venture. GATX contributed
cash in the joint venture transaction formation.

Ferrocarril y Terminal Del Valle De México, S.A. De
    C.V. (The Mexico Valley Railway and Terminal or
    “FTVM”)

FTVM was incorporated as a sociedad anonima de capital variable
(variable capital corporation), under the laws of Mexico. The
Corporate purpose of the company is to provide railroad services
as well as ancillary services, including those related to
interconnection, switching and haulage services. KCSM holds
25.0% of the share capital of FTVM. The other shareholders of
FTVM, each holding a 25.0% interest, are Ferrocarril Mexicano,
S.A. de C.V., Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de C.V. and the
Mexican Government.

HAULAGE RIGHTS

As a result of the 1988 acquisition of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad by UP, KCSR was granted (1) haulage rights between
Kansas City and each of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha and Lincoln,
Nebraska and Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, and (2) a joint
rate agreement for our grain traffic between Beaumont and each
of Houston and Galveston, Texas. KCSR has the right to convert
these haulage rights to trackage rights. KCSR’s haulage
rights require UP to move KCSR traffic in UP trains; trackage
rights would allow KCSR to operate its trains over UP tracks.
These rights have a term of 199 years. In addition, KCSR
has limited haulage rights between Springfield and Chicago for
shipments that originate or terminate on the former Gateway
Western rail lines.

Chemical and Petroleum

KCS’s subsidiaries transport chemical and petroleum
products via tank and hopper cars to markets in the southeast
and northeast U.S. and throughout Mexico through interchanges
with other rail carriers. Primary traffic includes plastics,
petroleum and oils, petroleum coke, rubber, and miscellaneous
chemicals.

Forest Products and Metals

KCSR’s rail lines run through the heart of the southeastern
U.S. timber-producing region. We believe that forest
products made from trees in this region are generally less
expensive than those from other regions due to lower production
costs. As a result, southern yellow pine products from the
southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western
producers that have experienced capacity reductions because of
public policy considerations. KCSR serves paper mills directly
and indirectly through short-line connections.

This product category includes metals, minerals and ores such as
iron, steel, zinc and copper. The majority of metals, minerals
and ores mined, and steel produced in Mexico are used for
domestic consumption. The volume of Mexican steel exports
fluctuates based on global market prices. Higher-end finished
products such as steel coils used by Mexican manufacturers in
automobiles, household appliances and other consumer goods are
imported through Nuevo Laredo and through the seaports served by
our rail lines. U.S. slab steel products are used primarily
in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry.

Agricultural and Mineral

Agricultural products consist of grain, food and related
products. Shipper demand for agricultural products is affected
by competition among sources of grain and grain products, as
well as price fluctuations in international markets for key
commodities. In the U.S., KCSR’s rail lines receive and
originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to
feed mills serving the poultry industry. Through its marketing
agreements, KCSR has access to sources of corn and other grain
in Iowa and other Midwestern states. KCSR currently serves feed
mills along its rail lines throughout Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. U.S. export grain
shipments and Mexico import grain shipments include primarily
wheat, soybeans and corn transported to Mexico via Laredo and to
the Gulf of Mexico for overseas destinations. Over the long
term, U.S. export grain shipments are expected to increase
as a result of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports. Food and
related products consist mainly of soybean meal, grain meal,
oils and canned goods, sugar and beer. Mineral shipments consist
of a variety of products including ores, clay, stone and cement.

Intermodal and Automotive

The intermodal freight business consists primarily of hauling
freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water,
rail and motor carriers, with rail carriers serving as the link
between the other modes of transportation. In 2005, KCS signed
an agreement with Norfolk Southern Corporation



(NS) which, if implemented, will place part of the Meridian
Speedway (KCSR’s rail line between Shreveport, LA and
Meridian, MS) into a joint venture with NS and enable us to
improve the Meridian Speedway. We anticipate that the
improvements to the Meridian Speedway resulting from this
agreement, if approved by the Surface Transportation Board and
consummated by KCS and NS, will further our efforts to increase
traffic between Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico and the eastern
seaboard.

Coal

KCS coal revenues are derived from traffic in the U.S., which is
served by KCSR. KCSR, directly or indirectly, delivers coal to
ten electric generating plants in the central
U.S. Principally all the coal KCSR transports originates in
the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and is transferred to
KCSR’s rail lines at Kansas City.

Other

Other rail-related revenues include a variety of miscellaneous
services provided to customers and interconnecting carriers.
Major items in this category include railcar switching services,
demurrage (railcar retention charges) and drayage (local truck
transportation services).

Government Regulation

In the U.S., the Company is subject to federal, state and local
laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses.
Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of
the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of the
U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the
Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as
other federal and state regulatory agencies. The STB has
jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain
rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail
lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and
consolidation or merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail
common carriers.

DOT and OSHA each have jurisdiction under several federal
statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials.
State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with
respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by
federal law.

KCSR rail operations, as well as those of our competitors, are
subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
regulation. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions,
toxic substances, and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.
This regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and
liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks
are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve
transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.

The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”)
and similar state laws (known as “Superfund laws”)
impose liability for the cost of remedial or removal actions,
natural resources damages and related costs at certain sites
identified as posing a threat to the environment or public
health. CERCLA imposes joint, strict and several liabilities on
the owners and operators of facilities in which hazardous waste
and other hazardous substances are deposited or from which they
are released or are likely to be released into the environment.
Liability may be imposed, without regard to fault or the
legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons,
including the current and certain prior owners or operators of a
site where hazardous substances have been released and persons
that arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances. In addition, other potentially responsible parties,
adjacent landowners or other third parties may initiate cost
recovery actions or toxic tort litigation against sites subject
to CERCLA or similar state laws. Given the nature of our
business, we presently have environmental investigation and
remediation obligations at certain sites, including a former
foundry site in Alexandria, Louisiana, and will likely incur
such obligations at additional sites in the future.



Although we have accrued for environmental liabilities, some of
these accruals have been reduced for amounts we expect to
recover from third party recoveries.

Our Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. The primary environmental law in Mexico is the
General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental
Protection (the “Ecological Law”). The Mexican
federal agency in charge of overseeing compliance with and
enforcement of the federal environmental law is the Ministry of
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
(“Semarnat”). The regulations issued under the Mexican
Ecological Law and technical environmental requirements issued
by Semarnat have promulgated standards for, among other things,
water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution,
hazardous substances and transportation and handling of
hazardous and solid waste. As part of its enforcement powers,
Semarnat is empowered to bring administrative and criminal
proceedings and impose economic sanctions against companies that
violate environmental laws, and temporarily or even permanently
close non-complying facilities. Under the Ecological Law, the
Mexican government has implemented a program to protect the
environment by promulgating rules concerning water, land, air
and noise pollution, and transportation and handling of
hazardous and solid waste materials. In addition, we are subject
to the environmental laws and regulations issued by the Mexican
governments of each of the states of Mexico where our facilities
are located. The terms of the Concession also impose on us
certain environmental law compliance obligations.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the
imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of
operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or
the termination of our concession. We believe that all
facilities that we operate are in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental laws, regulations and agency
agreements. There are currently no material legal or
administrative proceedings pending against us with respect to
any environmental matters and management does not believe that
continued compliance with environmental laws will have any
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that the
adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and
regulations would have on our results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction over KCSM is exercised by the
Secretary of Communications and Transports (Secretaria de
comunicaciones y Transportes or “Ministry of
Transportation”). The Ministry of Transportation
establishes regulations concerning railway safety and operations
in Mexico, and it is the agency responsible in the first
instance for resolving disputes between railways and between
railways and customers. In addition, KCSM must register its
maximum rates with the Ministry of Transportation and make
regular reports to the Ministry of Transportation on investment
and traffic volumes.

Competition

We compete against other railroads, many of which are much
larger and have significantly greater financial and other
resources. Since 1994, there has been significant consolidation
among major North American rail carriers. As a result of this
consolidation, the railroad industry is now dominated by a few
“mega-carriers.” We regard the larger western
railroads (BNSF Railway Company, or BNSF, and UP), in
particular, as significant competitors to our operations and
prospects because of their substantial resources. The ongoing
impact of these mergers is uncertain. We believe that because of
our investments and strategic alliances, we are positioned to
attract additional rail traffic through our rail network.

Although it is still subject to approval by the Mexican
Competition Commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia or
“CFC”), Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.
(“Ferromex”) has acquired control of and merged with
Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”),
creating Mexico’s largest railway. Together Ferromex and
Ferrosur are much larger than KCSM, and they serve most of the
major ports and cities in Mexico and own a fifty percent
interest in Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México,
S.A. de C.V. (the Mexico Valley Railway and Terminal or
“FTVM”), which serves all of the industries located
within Mexico City.



We are subject to competition from motor carriers, barge lines,
and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain routes
in operating areas. Truck carriers have eroded the railroad
industry’s share of total transportation revenues.
Intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price
sensitive competition, particularly from motor carriers.
However, rail carriers, including KCSR and KCSM, have placed an
emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working
together with motor carriers and each other to provide

end-to

-end
transportation of products.

While deregulation of freight rates has enhanced the ability of
railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes
of transportation, this increased competition has resulted in
downward pressure on freight rates. Competition with other
railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based
on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service
provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for
certain commodities.

Employees and Labor Relations

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
(“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
renegotiated when they become open for modification, but their
terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached.
Typically, neither management nor labor employees are permitted
to take economic action until extended procedures are exhausted.
Approximately 82% of KCSR’s employees are covered under
various collective bargaining agreements with different labor
organizations. Under the negotiating process for new collective
bargaining agreements which began on November 1, 1999, all
unions reached new labor agreements with KCSR in 2005. Wages,
health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have
been negotiated on an industry-wide scale. Previously, these
negotiations, which can take place over significant periods of
time, have not resulted in any extended work interruptions. The
existing agreements will remain in effect until new agreements
are reached or the RLA’s procedures are exhausted. Until
new agreements are reached, the current agreements provide for
periodic wage adjustments.

Approximately 71% of KCSM’s employees are covered by a
labor agreement, which was renewed in 2005 and is effective for
a two-year term ending in July 2007. The compensation terms of
the labor agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual
basis and all other terms are renegotiated every two years.
These negotiations have not resulted in any strikes, boycotts or
other significant disruptions of KCSM’s operations.

Insurance

KCS’s subsidiaries are subject to a number of risks,
including: (i) mechanical failure, (ii) collision,
(iii) personal injury and property loss, (iv) cargo
loss or damage, and (v) business interruption due to
natural disasters, political circumstances, hostilities and
labor strikes. In addition, the operation of any railroad is
subject to the inherent possibility of catastrophic disaster,
including chemical spills and other environmental mishaps.

Our present insurance coverage insures against the
accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business,
and is consistent with industry practice and, for KCSM, the
requirements of the Concession. For KCSM, Mexican railroad
services law and regulations provide that, if we receive
insurance proceeds in respect of any damage to our rail lines,
those proceeds shall be applied to the repair or remediation of
such damage or, in the event that we elect not to undertake such
repairs, these proceeds must be paid to the Mexican government.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We compete against other railroads and other
    transportation providers.

Our domestic and international operations are subject to
competition from other railroads, many of which are much larger
and have significantly greater financial and other resources. In
addition, we are subject to competition from truck carriers and
from barge lines and other maritime shipping. Increased



competition has resulted in downward pressure on freight rates.
Competition with other railroads and other modes of
transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the
quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality
of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities. While
we must build or acquire and maintain our infrastructure, truck
carriers and maritime shippers and barges are able to use public

rights-of

-way.
Continuing competitive pressures and declining margins, future
improvements that increase the quality of alternative modes of
transportation in the locations in which we operate, or
legislation that provides motor carriers with additional
advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and less weight
restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

If the railroad industry in general, and our Mexican operations
in particular, are unable to preserve their competitive
advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry, our projected
revenues could be adversely affected. Additionally, the revenue
growth attributable to our Mexican operations could be affected
by, among other factors, its inability to grow its existing
customer base, negative macroeconomic developments impacting the
U.S. and Mexican economies, and failure to capture additional
cargo transport market share from the shipping industry and
other railroads.

NAFTA called for Mexican trucks to have unrestricted access to
highways in U.S. Border States by 1995 and full access to
all U.S. highways by January 2000. However, the
U.S. has not followed the timetable because of concerns
over Mexico’s trucking safety standards. In February 2001,
a NAFTA tribunal ruled in arbitration between the U.S. and
Mexico that the U.S. must allow Mexican trucks to cross the
border and operate on U.S. highways. On March 14,
2002, as part of its agreement under NAFTA, the
U.S. Department of Transportation issued safety rules that
allow Mexican truckers to apply for operating authority to
transport goods beyond the

20-mile

commercial
zones along the Unites States-Mexico border. These safety rules
require Mexican carriers seeking to operate in the U.S. to
pass, among other things, safety inspections; to obtain valid
insurance with a U.S. registered insurance company, to
conduct alcohol and drug testing for drivers and to obtain a
U.S. Department of Transportation identification number.
Mexican commercial vehicles with authority to operate beyond the
commercial zones will be permitted to enter the U.S. only
at commercial border crossings and only when a certified motor
carrier safety inspector is on duty. Given these recent
developments, there can be no assurance that truck transport
between Mexico and the U.S. will not increase substantially
in the future. Such an increase could affect our ability to
continue converting traffic to rail from truck transport because
it may result in an expansion of the availability, or an
improvement of the quality, of the trucking services offered in
Mexico.

Through the Concession with the Mexican government, KCSM has the
right to control and operate the southern half of the
rail-bridge at Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM
must grant to Ferromex the right to operate over a north-south
portion of its rail lines between Ramos Arizpe near Monterrey
and the city of Queretaro that constitutes over 600 kilometers
of KCSM’s main track. Using these trackage rights, Ferromex
may be able to compete with KCSM over its rail lines for traffic
between Mexico City and the U.S. The Concession also
requires KCSM to grant rights to use certain portions of its
tracks to Ferrosur and FTVM, thereby providing Ferrosur with
more efficient access to certain Mexico City industries. As a
result of having to grant trackage rights to other railroads, we
incur additional maintenance costs and lose the flexibility of
using a portion of our tracks at all times.

In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among
major North American rail carriers. The resulting merged
railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to
block other railroads’ access to efficient gateways and
routing options that are currently and have been historically
available. There can be no assurance that further consolidation
will not have an adverse effect on our operations.

Our business strategy, operations and growth rely
    significantly on joint ventures and other strategic
    alliances.

Operation of our integrated rail network and our plans for
growth and expansion rely significantly on joint ventures and
other strategic alliances. Our operations are dependent on
interchange, trackage rights,



haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and
third parties that enable us to exchange traffic and utilize
trackage we do not own. Our ability to provide comprehensive
rail service to our customers depends in large part upon our
ability to maintain these agreements with other railroads and
third parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew,
these agreements could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We are also dependent in
part upon the financial health and efficient performance of
other railroads. For example, much of Tex-Mex’s traffic
moves over the UP’s lines via trackage rights, a
significant portion of our grain shipments originate with
IC&E pursuant to our marketing agreement with it, and BNSF
is our largest partner in the interchange of rail traffic. There
can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely
affected by operational or financial difficulties of other
railroads.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
use portions of its tracks to Ferromex, Ferrosur and the FTVM.
Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex, Ferrosur and the FTVM
are required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of their
tracks. Applicable law provides that the Ministry of
Transportation is entitled to set the rates in the event that
KCSM and the party to whom it is granting the rights cannot
agree on a rate. KCSM and Ferromex have not been able to agree
upon the rates each of them is required to pay the other for
interline services and haulage and trackage rights. In February
2001, KCSM initiated an administrative proceeding requesting a
determination of such rates by the Ministry of Transportation,
which subsequently issued a ruling establishing rates using
certain criteria. KCSM and Ferromex appealed the rulings before
the Mexican Federal Courts due to, among other things, a
disagreement with the methodology employed by the Ministry of
Transportation in calculating the trackage rights and interline
rates. KCSM and Ferromex also requested and obtained a
suspension of the effectiveness of the ruling pending resolution
of the litigation. In February 2006, the Mexican Supreme Court
issued a favorable decision upholding KCSM’s position
concerning the methodology for establishing rates for trackage
rights. This decision is not subject to further appeal. The
Ministry of Transportation now has the responsibility to
establish rates for trackage rights consistent with the court
decision. The litigation concerning the methodology for
establishing rates for interline services is still pending.

Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to fulfill
    obligations under various debt instruments and operate our
    business.

Our level of debt could make it more difficult for us to borrow
money in the future, will reduce the amount of money available
to finance our operations and other business activities,
including capital expenditures, exposes us to the risk of
increased interest rates, makes us more vulnerable to general
economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, could reduce
our flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing
business and economic conditions, and may prevent us from
raising the funds necessary to repurchase all of certain senior
notes that could be tendered upon the occurrence of a change of
control, which would constitute an event of default under the
terms of the indentures for such senior notes. Our failure to
comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our
debt instruments, which, among other things, require us to
maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to
incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default
that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse
effect on our business or prospects. If we do not have enough
cash to service our debt, meet other obligations and fund other
liquidity needs, we may be required to take actions such as
reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets,
restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt,
or seeking additional equity capital. We cannot assure that any
of these remedies, including obtaining appropriate waivers from
our lenders or new facilities, can be effected on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing
or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of
these alternatives.

The indebtedness of KCSM exposes us to risks in exchange rate
fluctuations, because any devaluation of the peso would cause
the cost of KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase; and
place us at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico compared to our
Mexican competitors that have less debt and greater operating
and financing flexibility than KCSM does.



Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial
ongoing expenditures for, among other things, improvements to
roadway, structures and technology, acquisitions, leases and
repair of equipment, and maintenance of our rail system. Our
failure to make necessary capital expenditures to maintain our
operations could impair our ability to accommodate increases in
traffic volumes or service existing customers.

In addition, the Concession requires us to make investments and
undertake capital projects, including capital projects described
in a business plan filed by KCSM every five years with the
Mexican government. We may defer capital expenditures with
respect to KCSM’s five-year business plan with the
permission of the Ministry of Transportation. However, the
Ministry of Transportation may not grant this permission, and
KCSM’s failure to comply with the commitments in its
business plan could result in the Mexican government revoking
the Concession.

Our business may be adversely affected by changes in
    general economic, weather or other conditions.

Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the
economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that
produce and consume the freight that we transport.

PCRC and Panarail Tourism Company are directly affected by its
local economy. Our investment in PCRC has risks associated with
operating in Panama, including, among others, cultural
differences, varying labor and operating practices, political
risk and differences between the U.S. and Panamanian economies.
Historically, a stronger economy has resulted in improved
results for our rail transportation operations. Conversely, when
the economy has slowed, results have been less favorable. Our
revenues may be affected by prevailing economic conditions and,
if an economic slowdown or recession occurs in our key markets,
the volume of rail shipments is likely to be reduced.

Our operations also may be affected by adverse weather
conditions. We operate in and along the Gulf Coast of the U.S.,
and our facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes and
other extreme weather conditions. For example, recent hurricanes
have adversely affected some of our shippers located along the
Gulf Coast and caused interruptions in the flow of traffic
within the Southern U.S. and between the U.S. and Mexico. As
another example, a weak harvest in the Midwest may substantially
reduce the volume of business handled for agricultural products
customers. Many of the goods and commodities we transport
experience cyclical demand. Our results of operations can be
expected to reflect this cyclical demand because of the
significant fixed costs inherent in railroad operations. Our
operations may also be affected by natural disasters or
terrorist acts. Significant reductions in our volume of rail
shipments due to economic, weather or other conditions could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally
tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although
transportation markets are affected by general economic
conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each
particular market segment that may influence operating results.
Some of our customers do business in industries that are highly
cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive and agricultural
sectors. Any downturn in these sectors could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results. Also, some of the
products we transport have had a historical pattern of price
cyclicality, which has typically been influenced by the general
economic environment and by industry capacity and demand. For
example, global steel and petrochemical prices have decreased in
the past. We cannot assure you that prices and demand for these
products will not decline in the future, adversely affecting
those industries and, in turn, our financial results.

Our business is subject to regulation by international,
    federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Our failure to
    comply with various federal, state and local regulations could
    have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We are subject to governmental regulation by international,
federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to our
railroad operations, as well as a variety of health, safety,
labor, environmental, and other matters. Government regulation
of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the



competitiveness and profitability of railroads. Our failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our operations, including limitations
on our operating activities until compliance with applicable
requirements is completed. These government agencies may change
the legislative or regulatory framework within which we operate
without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on our
business that occurs as a result of this change. Additionally,
some of the regulations require us to obtain and maintain
various licenses, permits and other authorizations, and we
cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to do so.

Our business is subject to environmental, health and
    safety laws and regulations that could require us to incur
    material costs or liabilities relating to environmental, health
    or safety compliance or remediation.

Our operations are subject to extensive international, federal,
state and local environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the
air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation
and disposal of waste and other materials, the cleanup of
hazardous material or petroleum releases, decommissioning of
underground storage tanks and noise pollution. Violations of
these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties,
permit revocations, facility shutdowns and other civil and
criminal sanctions. From time to time, our facilities have not
been in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws
and regulations and there can be no assurances that we will
always be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the
future. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, environmental
compliance costs, including, in particular, costs necessary to
maintain compliance with requirements governing chemical and
hazardous material shipping operations, refueling operations and
repair facilities. New laws and regulations, stricter
enforcement of existing requirements, new spills, releases or
violations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination
could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or
increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

In the operation of a railroad, it is possible that derailments,
explosions or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to
the environment or to human health. As a result, we may incur
costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such
harm, including costs relating to the performance of clean-ups,
natural resources damages and compensatory or punitive damages
relating to harm to property or individuals.

The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”)
and similar state laws (known as “Superfund laws”)
impose liability for the cost of remedial or removal actions,
natural resources damages and related costs at certain sites
identified as posing a threat to the environment or public
health. CERCLA imposes joint, strict and several liabilities on
the owners and operators of facilities in which hazardous waste
and other hazardous substances are deposited or from which they
are released or are likely to be released into the environment.
Liability may be imposed, without regard to fault or the
legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons,
including the current and certain prior owners or operators of a
site where hazardous substances have been released and persons
that arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances. In addition, other potentially responsible parties,
adjacent landowners or other third parties may initiate cost
recovery actions or toxic tort litigation against sites subject
to CERCLA or similar state laws. Given the nature of our
business, we presently have environmental investigation and
remediation obligations at certain sites, including a former
foundry site in Alexandria, Louisiana, and will likely incur
such obligations at additional sites in the future. Although we
have accrued for environmental liabilities, some of these
accruals have been reduced for amounts we expect to recover from
third party recoveries. We cannot assure you that the costs
associated with these obligations will not be material or exceed
the accruals we have established.

Our Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. The primary environmental law in Mexico is the
General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental
Protection (the “Ecological Law”). The Mexican
federal agency in charge of overseeing compliance with and
enforcement of the federal environmental law is the Ministry of
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
(“Semarnat”). The regulations issued under the Mexican
Ecological Law and technical environmental requirements issued
by Semarnat have promulgated



standards for, among other things, water discharge, water
supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and
transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. As
part of its enforcement powers, Semarnat is empowered to bring
administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic
sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and
temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.
Under the Ecological Law, the Mexican government has implemented
a program to protect the environment by promulgating rules
concerning water, land, air and noise pollution, and hazardous
substances. We are also subject to the laws of various
jurisdictions and international conferences with respect to the
discharge of materials into the environment. We cannot predict
the effect, if any, that the adoption of additional or more
stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on
KCSM’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

Our business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and
    disruptions in fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the
    cost of fuel, or severe disruption of fuel supplies, would have
    a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition.

We incur substantial fuel costs in our railroad operations and
these costs represent a significant portion of our
transportation expenses. Fuel expense has increased from
approximately 12% of our consolidated operating costs for the
full year 2004 to its current level representing approximately
16% of our consolidated operating costs for 2005. This increase
has been, in part, offset by fuel surcharges applied to our
customer billings. If we are unable to continue the existing
fuel surcharge program at KCSR and expand the fuel surcharge
program for KCSM, our operating results could be materially
adversely affected.

Fuel costs are affected by traffic levels, efficiency of
operations and equipment, and petroleum market conditions. The
supply and cost of fuel is subject to market conditions and is
influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including
general economic conditions, world markets, government programs
and regulations and competition. In addition, instability in the
Middle East and interruptions in domestic production and
refining due to hurricane damage may result in an increase in
fuel prices. Significant price increases for fuel may have a
material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally,
fuel prices and supplies could also be affected by any
limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory
allocation or rationing regulations. In the event of a severe
disruption of fuel supplies resulting from supply shortages,
political unrest, a disruption of oil imports, weather events,
war or otherwise, the resulting impact on fuel prices and
subsequent price increases could materially adversely affect our
operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

We currently meet, and expect to continue to meet, fuel
requirements for our Mexican operations almost exclusively
through purchases at market prices from Petroleos Mexicanos, the
national oil company of Mexico (“PEMEX”), a
government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the
distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to
a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration. Either
party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written
notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is
terminated and we are unable to acquire diesel fuel from
alternate sources on acceptable terms, our Mexican operations
could be materially adversely affected.

A majority of our employees belong to labor unions.
    Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our
    operations.

We are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various
labor unions in the U.S. Approximately 82% of KCSR
employees are covered under these agreements. Similarly,
approximately 71% of KCSM employees are subject to collective
labor contracts. We may be subject to, among other things,
strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of
disputes with regard to the terms of these collective bargaining
agreements and labor contracts or our potential inability to
negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the U.S.,
because such agreements are generally negotiated on an
industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions
of future labor agreements could be beyond our control and, as a
result, we may be subject to terms and conditions in amended or
future labor agreements that could have a material adverse
affect on our results of operations, financial position and cash
flows. If the unionized workers in the U.S. or Mexico were
to engage in a strike, work stoppage or



other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized or
the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of
our operations and higher ongoing labor costs.

Our business may be subject to various claims and
    lawsuits.

The nature of the railroad business exposes us to the potential
for various claims and litigation related to labor and
employment, personal injury and property damage, environmental
and other matters. We maintain insurance (including
self-insurance) consistent with the industry practice against
accident-related risks involved in the operation of the
railroad. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance
would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages suffered or
that such insurance will continue to be available at
commercially reasonable rates. Any material changes to current
litigation trends could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
crossing collisions and derailments, as well as claims related
to personal property damage and other casualties is a
substantial expense to KCS. Personal injury and casualty claims
are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty, especially
estimates related to personal injuries which have occurred but
not yet been reported, therefore, the degree to which injuries
have been incurred and the related costs have not yet been
determined. Further, the cost of casualty claims is related to
numerous factors, including the severity of the injury, the age
of the claimant, and the legal jurisdiction. In determining the
provision for casualty claims, management must make estimates
regarding future costs related to substantially uncertain
matters. Changes in these estimates could have a material effect
on the results of operations in future periods.

Our business may be affected by future acts of terrorism
    or war.

Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on
September 11, 2001, any government response thereto and war
or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations,
financial condition, and cash flows. These acts may also impact
our ability to raise capital or our future business
opportunities. Our rail lines and facilities could be direct
targets or indirect casualties of an act or acts of terror,
which could cause significant business interruption and result
in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. These
acts could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition,
insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage
currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or
certain coverage may not be available in the future.

Additional Risk Factors Relating to Our Operations in
Mexico

The Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances.

The Mexican government may terminate the Concession granted to
KCSM as a result of KCSM’s surrender of its rights under
the Concession, or for reasons of public interest, by revocation
or upon KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy. The Mexican
government may also temporarily seize KCSM’s assets and its
rights under the Concession. The Mexican railroad services law
and regulations provide that the Ministry of Communications and
Transports (“Ministry of Transportation”) may revoke
the Concession upon the occurrence of specified events, some of
which will trigger automatic revocation. Revocation or
termination of the Concession would prevent KCSM from operating
its railroad and would materially adversely affect our Mexican
operations and ability to make payments on our debt. In the
event that the Concession is revoked by the Ministry of
Transportation, KCSM will receive no compensation, and its
interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the
Concession, as well as all improvements made by it, will revert
to the Mexican government.

Our ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject us
    to political and economic risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise,
significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly,
Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and
state-owned



enterprises could have a significant impact on Mexican private
sector entities in general and on our Mexican operations in
particular, as well as on market conditions, prices and returns
on Mexican securities, including KCSM’s outstanding notes.
The national elections held on July 2, 2000 ended
71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party
with the election of President Vicente Fox Quesada, a member of
the National Action Party, and resulted in the increased
representation of opposition parties in the Mexican Congress and
in mayoral and gubernatorial positions. National elections will
be held again on July 2, 2006. Although there have not yet
been any material adverse repercussions resulting from this
political change, multiparty rule is still relatively new in
Mexico and could result in economic or political conditions that
could materially and adversely affect our Mexican operations. We
cannot predict the impact that this new political landscape will
have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore, our financial
condition, results of operations and prospects and,
consequently, the market price for KCSM’s outstanding
notes, may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation,
interest rates, regulation, taxation, social instability and
other political, social and economic developments in or
affecting Mexico.

The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment
deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. There are
currently no exchange controls in Mexico. However, Mexico has
imposed foreign exchange controls in the past. Pursuant to the
provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of
payment difficulties or the threat thereof in the future, Mexico
would have the right to impose foreign exchange controls on
investments made in Mexico, including those made by U.S. and
Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange control policy
could adversely affect our ability to obtain dollars or to
convert pesos into dollars for purposes of making interest and
principal payments due on indebtedness, to the extent that it
may have to effect those conversions. This could have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Securities of companies in emerging market countries tend to be
influenced by economic and market conditions in other emerging
market countries. Emerging market countries, including Argentina
and Brazil, have recently been experiencing significant economic
downturns and market volatility. These events have had an
adverse effect on the economic conditions and securities markets
of emerging market countries, including Mexico.

Our Mexican operations may also be adversely affected by
currency fluctuations, price instability, inflation, interest
rates, regulations, taxation, cultural differences, social
instability, labor disputes and other political, social and
economic developments in or affecting Mexico.

Downturns in the U.S. economy or in trade between the
    U.S. and Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange
    rate would likely have adverse effects on our business and
    results of operations.

The level and timing of our Mexican business activity is heavily
dependent upon the level of

U.S.-Mexican

trade and
the effects of NAFTA on such trade. Downturns in the
U.S. or Mexican economy or in trade between the U.S. and
Mexico would likely have adverse effects on our business and
results of operations. Our Mexican operations depend on the U.S.
and Mexican markets for the products KCSM transports, the
relative position of Mexico and the U.S. in these markets
at any given time, and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Any
future downturn in the U.S. economy could have a material
adverse effect on KCSM’s results of operations and its
ability to meet its debt service obligations as described above.

Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate could lead
to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and
exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of
the commodities that KCSM transports to the U.S. may be
offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities
KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase
might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future
developments in

U.S.-Mexican

trade
beyond our control may result in a reduction of freight volumes
or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and
commodities KCSM carries.

Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of
KCSM’S dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely
affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness.
Severe devaluation or



depreciation of the peso may result in disruption of the
international foreign exchange markets and may limit our ability
to transfer or to convert pesos into U.S. dollars for the
purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on
our non-peso denominated indebtedness. Although the Mexican
government currently does not restrict, and for many years has
not restricted, the right or ability of Mexican or foreign
persons or entities to convert pesos into U.S. dollars or
transfer foreign currencies out of Mexico, the Mexican
government could, as in the past, institute restrictive exchange
rate policies that could limit our ability to transfer or
convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other currencies for the
purpose of making timely payments of our
U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments.
Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the
U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar
prices for our securities. Currency fluctuations are likely to
continue to have an effect on our financial condition in future
periods.

Mexico may experience high levels of inflation in the
    future which could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation, and may
experience high inflation in the future. During most of the
1980s and during the mid- and

late-1990s,

Mexico
experienced periods of high levels of inflation. The annual
rates of inflation for the last five years, as measured by
changes in the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by
Banco de Mexico ranged from 4% to 5.7%. A substantial increase
in the Mexican inflation rate would have the effect of
increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could adversely
affect its results of operations and financial condition. High
levels of inflation may also affect the balance of trade between
Mexico and the U.S., and other countries, which could adversely
affect KCSM’s results of operations.

Stock,” and in Part II Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data”, at Note 11
“Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)” of this
Form

is
incorporated by reference in partial response to this
Item 5.



We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock
during the last five fiscal years and we do not anticipate
making any cash dividend payments to common stockholders in the
foreseeable future. Pursuant to our credit agreement, we are
prohibited from the payment of cash dividends on our common
stock.

On May 5, 2003, KCS completed the sale of $200 million
(400,000 shares) of 4.25% Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (“Convertible
Preferred Stock”), with a liquidation preference of
$500 per share in a private offering under Rule 144A
to qualified institutional buyers. Net proceeds to KCS were
$193 million after fees to the initial purchasers of
$7 million and other expenses of the offering. Dividends on
the Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and will be
payable quarterly at an annual rate of 4.25% of the liquidation
preference, when, and if declared by our Board of Directors.
Accumulated unpaid dividends will accumulate dividends at the
same 4.25% rate. Each share of the Convertible Preferred Stock
will be convertible, under certain conditions, and subject to
adjustment under certain conditions, into 33.4728 shares of
our common stock. Conversion rights arise only upon the
occurrence of the following: (i) the closing sale price of
KCS’s common stock exceeds a specified level for a
specified period; (ii) certain credit rating downgrades;
(iii) the convertible preferred stock trading below a
certain level for a specified period; (iv) notice of
redemption; and (v) the occurrence of certain corporate
transactions. On or after May 20, 2008, KCS will have the
option to redeem any or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock,
subject to certain conditions. Under certain circumstances, at
the option of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock,
KCS may be required to purchase shares of the Convertible
Preferred Stock from the holders.

Following completion of the preparation of the 2005 financial
statements of KCS, the Company determined that its Consolidated
Coverage Ratio (as defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


%
Senior Notes and


/


% Senior Notes) was less than 2.0:1. As a result,
pursuant to the terms of each KCSR indenture, the Company is
currently unable to pay cash dividends on its Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock and dividends in cash or shares of
KCS common stock on its Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock (as defined below) and will be unable to pay such
dividends until such ratio increases to at least 2.0:1. KCS
anticipates that the ratio will increase by the end of the third
quarter of 2006 such that it will again be permitted to pay cash
dividends to these preferred stockholders although that cannot
be assured. A special meeting of the holders of record of the
Convertible Preferred Stock as of March 17, 2006 (the
“Series C Stockholders”), was held on
March 30, 2006 to vote on a proposed amendment to the terms
of the Convertible Preferred Stock to allow the payment of
dividends to the Series C Stockholders to be made, at the
discretion of the Company, in cash, in shares of KCS common
stock or in any combination thereof. As a quorum of the
Series C Stockholders was not present in person or by proxy
at the special meeting, the special meeting was adjourned
indefinitely. Absent approval of such an amendment, the unpaid
dividends for each of the Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock and the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
(collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) will accumulate
until such time that the Company may resume paying cash
dividends to the holders of both classes of Preferred Stock.
Whenever dividends on the Preferred Stock or another class or
series of stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock are
in arrears for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number
of days in the aggregate) holders of the Preferred Stock will be
entitled to vote for the election of two of the authorized
directors at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and at
each subsequent Shareholders’ Meeting until such time as
all accumulated dividends are paid, set aside for payment or the
Preferred Stock has been redeemed.

On March 23, 2006, Standard & Poor’s Rating
Service (“S&P”) placed our preferred stock ratings
on CreditWatch with negative implications. This rating action
was taken after we announced that KCS failed to meet the
consolidated coverage ratio threshold under the KCSR senior
notes indentures that would allow us to pay cash dividends on
our preferred stock.

On April 4, 2006, S&P placed its

BB-

ratings on KCS and
KCSM on CreditWatch with negative implications and lowered the
Company’s preferred stock ratings to CCC from

B-.

The preferred stock
credit ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications.
The rating actions followed recent negative developments,
including the delay in filing our Annual Report on
Form

10-K;

and to
reflect an increased risk of KCS failing to make the next
dividend payment on its preferred stock as a result of the



special meeting being adjourned indefinitely. S&P has
indicated that the preferred stock ratings would likely be
lowered to ‘D’ if the May 15, 2006 dividend
payment is missed. All ratings could be lowered if the Company
fails to address liquidity concerns or fails to demonstrate the
likelihood of improved financial results over the near to
intermediate term.

On April 5, 2006 Moody’s Investors Service
(“Moody’s”) placed all of KCS’, KCSR’s,
and KCSM’s debt ratings under review for possible
downgrade. Moody’s review was prompted by KCS’
inability to file our Annual Report on
Form

10-K

by
March 31, 2006.

On December 9, 2005, Kansas City Southern (“KCS”)
completed the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its


/


%
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock Series D
(the “Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”), par
value $1.00 per share. Each share of Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time, into
shares of KCS common stock at a conversion rate of
33.3333 shares of KCS common stock for each share of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to
adjustments to the conversion rate as a result of dividends or
distributions payable in shares of KCS common stock, subdivision
or reclassification of shares of KCS common stock, and other
events in which the KCS common stock may be diluted as provided
in the Certificate of Designation of


/


%
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Kansas City
Southern (“Certificate of Designation”). Dividends on
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are payable at the
discretion of the Company in cash, in KCS common stock or any
combination thereof, when, as and if declared by the KCS board
of directors, at the rate of 5.125% per annum of the
liquidation preference of $1,000 quarterly in arrears. Dividends
on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative
from the date of issuance. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate at the
annual rate of 5.125%. The Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock ranks senior to the common stock and to each class or
series of KCS capital stock that has terms that provide that
such class or series will rank junior to the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock and includes a liquidation
preference that entitles the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock holders to payment of $1,000 per share of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock plus an amount equal
to all dividends (whether or not declared) accumulated and
unpaid on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to the
date of a final distribution in the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or

winding-up

of KCS,
before any payment or distribution of the KCS’s assets
shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any KCS capital
stock ranking junior to the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock. Upon certain designated events, holders of the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may, subject to
legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or all of
their shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at the
liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid
dividends to the date of redemption, which KCS may pay in either
cash, in shares of KCS common stock, or any combination thereof
at KCS’s option. Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
holders will have no other right to require KCS to redeem the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at any time. On or
after February 20, 2011, KCS may, at its option, cause all,
and not less than all, of the outstanding shares of
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically
converted into shares of KCS common stock at the then prevailing
conversion rate, but only if the closing sale price of the KCS
common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect
equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference for 20
trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, and
if KCS has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the
dividend payment date immediately preceding the forced
conversion date.

On December 12, 2005 the Company used substantially all of
the proceeds from the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
offering to repurchase 9,000,000 shares of KCS Common
Stock issued in April 2005 in connection with the acquisition of
KCSM. All of the 9,000,000 shares were purchased at a price
of $22.25 per share or $200.3 million. The Company
does not have a formal program for the repurchase of any
additional shares of our equity securities.

As of February 28, 2006, there were 4,806 record holders of
our common stock.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

KCS, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with principal
operations in rail transportation and its principal subsidiaries
and affiliates including the following:

KCS, as the holding company, supplies its various subsidiaries
with managerial, legal, tax, financial and accounting services,
in addition to managing other “non-operating”
investments.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

During the first quarter of 2005, we operated under one
reportable business segment in the rail transportation industry.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2005 with the acquisition of
a controlling interest in Grupo TFM, we began operating under
two reportable business segments, which are defined
geographically as U.S. and Mexico. The U.S. segment
consists primarily of KCSR and Mexrail, while Mexico includes
primarily Grupo TFM and its operating subsidiary KCSM. In both
the U.S. and the Mexico segments we generate our revenues and
cash flows by providing our customers with freight delivery
services both within our regions, and throughout North America
through connections with other Class I rail carriers. Our
customers conduct business in a number of different industries,
including electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum
products, paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral
products, automotive products and intermodal transportation.

We use our cash flows to support our operations and invest in
our infrastructure. The rail industry is a capital-intensive
industry, and our capital expenditures are a significant use of
cash each year. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
consolidated capital expenditures were approximately
$275.7 million. A more detailed discussion of capital
expenditures is found in the “Liquidity and Capital
Resources” section below.

For the first quarter of 2005, Grupo TFM was an unconsolidated
affiliate, and we used the equity method of accounting to
recognize our proportionate share of Grupo TFM’s earnings.
On December 15, 2004, KCS entered into the Amended and
Restated Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition
Agreement”) with TMM, and other parties under which KCS
acquired control of KCSM through the purchase of TMM’s
shares of Grupo TFM (the “Acquisition”). Grupo TFM
held an 80% economic interest in KCSM and all of the shares of
stock with full voting rights of KCSM. The remaining 20%
economic interest in KCSM was owned by the Mexican government in
the form of shares with limited voting rights. The Mexican
government had certain put rights with respect to its KCSM
shares. On



March 29, 2005, at a special meeting of the KCS
shareholders, approval of the issuance of shares of KCS common
stock in connection with the Acquisition was received and
closing was completed on April 1, 2005. Accordingly,
beginning in the second quarter of 2005, KCS began including the
operating revenues and expenses of Grupo TFM in its consolidated
financial statements.

On September 12, 2005, the Company and its subsidiaries,
KCSM and Grupo TFM, along with the Mexican holding company TMM,
entered into a settlement agreement with the Mexican government,
resolving the controversies and disputes between the companies
and the Mexican government concerning the payment of a value
added tax (“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the obligation
(“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of KCSM owned
by the Mexican government (the “VAT/ Put Settlement”).
As a result of the VAT/ Put Settlement, KCS and its subsidiaries
now own 100% of Grupo TFM and KCSM. The potential obligation of
KCS, Grupo TFM and TMM to acquire the Mexican government’s
remaining 20% ownership of KCSM has been eliminated; and the
legal obligation of the Mexican government to issue the VAT
refund to KCSM has been satisfied. There was no cash exchanged
between the parties to the settlement agreement. In addition,
the parties entered into mutual releases of all existing and
potential claims relating to the VAT refund and the Put
obligation, and entered into an agreement to dismiss all of the
existing litigation between the parties.

As a result of the final resolution of the VAT claim and Put
obligation, KCS was required to make a contingency payment of
$110.0 million to TMM in accordance with the terms of the
December 15, 2004 Amended and Restated Acquisition
Agreement in a combination of stock, notes and cash. In
addition, a contingent payment of $9.0 million to Jose F.
Serrano International Business, S.A. de C.V. (“JSIB”)
also became payable upon final resolution of the VAT claim and
Put obligation. On March 13, 2006, in settlement of the
$110.0 million obligation to TMM, KCS paid $35 million
in cash, issued 1,494,469 shares of KCS Common Stock at the
VWAP price of $23.4197, as determined in connection with the
Acquisition Agreement, and issued a $40 million, five year
note. Also on March 13, 2006, in settlement of the
$9.0 million obligation to JSIB, KCS paid $9.0 million
in cash to JSIB.

Effective January 1, 2005, the financial results of Mexrail
were consolidated into KCS as a result of KCS taking possession
from the trustee of 51% of the shares of Mexrail following the
Surface Transportation Board’s approval of the
Company’s application for authority to exercise common
control over KCSR, the Gateway Eastern Railway Company and
Tex-Mex. The remaining 49% of Mexrail is owned by KCSM. With the
completion of the acquisition of 100% of KCSM, the Company has
control of 100% of Mexrail.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Operating units that are reported as segments include the U.S.
and Mexico segments. Appropriate eliminations of revenue and
reclassifications of operating revenues and expenses have been
recorded in deriving consolidated data. The U.S. segment
consists primarily of KCSR and Tex-Mex. Mexico consists of Grupo
TFM, KCSM and Arrendadora TFM S.A. de C.V.
(“Arrendadora”). Each of these segments is supported
by separate executive management, operates and serves different
geographical regions, and is subject to different customs, laws,
and tax regulations.

2005 Analysis

The Company completed the acquisition of Mexrail on
January 1, 2005 and KCSM on April 1, 2005, doubling
our size in terms of total revenue. Net income for the year
ended December 31, 2005 increased by $76.5 million
compared to the prior year. Operating income decreased by
$21.2 million, interest expense increased by
$89.1 million, and a net gain of $131.9 million was
achieved in the Vat/ Put Settlement. In the second quarter,
$17.8 million of the KCSM loss was allocated to the
minority interest. The provision for income taxes decreased by
$30.7 million and various other factors increased by
$6.4 million.

Strong revenue growth continued in all major commodity and
geographic markets, with increases of 25.8% in the United
States, including 11.5% related to the acquisition of Mexrail,
for the twelve months



ended December 31, 2005, and 7.3% in Mexico for the nine
months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the nine months
ended December 31, 2005. The growth resulted from a
combination of targeted rate increases, variable fuel
surcharges, and increased traffic volume across the system.

In the United States, revenue increased by $164.9 million.
Operating expenses increased by $203.3 million, including a
$57.4 million increase in fuel costs and a third quarter
charge of $37.8 million charge to recognize additional
costs related to occupational and personal injury claims.
U.S. operations were adversely affected in the third and
fourth quarter of 2005 by the severe weather and hurricanes in
the Gulf Coast region. Operating income decreased by
$38.4 million. The higher level of capital expenditures
during 2005 achieved broad improvements to the system and will
provide future capacity.

In Mexico, during the nine months of consolidated results
following the April 1, 2005 acquisition, revenues were
$547.6 million and operating income was $17.2 million
marked by trends similar to the U.S. Segment regarding fuel
costs which were approximately 15.2% of revenues. Mexico net
income of $103.6 was also impacted by the VAT/Put Settlement
which was reflected as non-operating income of $140.9 offset by
interest expense of $71.6 million.

Consolidated net income available to common shareholders
increased by $75.7 million to $91.4 million. Weighted
average fully diluted common shares outstanding increased by
28.758 million due primarily to the April 1 issuance
of 18 million common shares for the KCSM acquisition and to
the increase in the number of potentially dilutive shares.
Earnings per share increased by $0.85 to $1.10 fully diluted.

2006 Outlook

The 2006 year should reflect the initial stage of the long
term benefits that will result from these newly combined
companies. Organizational realignments have largely been
completed, and various initiatives are already underway to
enhance customer service, improve operating efficiencies and
velocity, and increase freight volumes. Several major capital
projects are expected to be launched in 2006 by the recently
announced joint venture with Norfolk Southern on the Meridian
Speedway, and those will begin to facilitate significant
increases in capacity and profitable volumes.

Revenue is expected to continue to grow with increasing volumes
of freight traffic over the Company’s integrated system to
and from Mexico. The transportation operating system that has
been used successfully in the Company’s
U.S. operations is being implemented in Mexico, and is
expected to lead to gains in operating efficiencies there as
well. Fuel costs are expected to continue to fluctuate at levels
higher than historical experience.

High priority is being given to several key aspects of
operations company-wide, and these are also expected to yield
improved financial results. Initiatives have recently been
launched to achieve aggressive new safety goals in 2006.
Increased train velocity is the focus of a broad range of other
initiatives, and expected to produce further improvements in
customer service and revenue growth.

The completion of the acquisition of KCSM has resulted in the
full inclusion of its financial performance in the financial
statements of KCS on a consolidated basis. Factors unique to the
Mexican economy and business climate, including exchange rates,
tax laws, and inflation, are now impacting the Company’s
financial reports and performance to a greater extent. We are
not able to predict the impact of those factors on future
results.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On March 31, 2006 KCS failed to timely file our Annual
Reports on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. As a result of this failure to timely file KCS and
KCSR were unable to comply with certain reporting requirements
contained in the Credit Agreement (as defined below). In
addition KCSM failed to comply with certain reporting
requirements and other terms of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement
(as defined below). These failures constituted defaults under
the terms of each of the credit agreements and limited the
ability of KCSR and KCSM to access the revolving credit facility
in



each of their respective credit agreements. On April 7,
2006 KCS and KCSR received a waiver from the lenders under the
Credit Agreement and KCSM received an amendment and waiver from
the lenders under the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement. The waiver and
the amendment and waiver, as more fully discussed below, waived
the defaults and extended the timeframe for reporting
requirements for 2005 fiscal year results from March 31,
2006 until April 30, 2006. Neither of KCS, KCSR or KCSM is
currently in default under their respective credit agreements.

Following KCS’ failure to timely file our Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Standard & Poor’s Rating Service
(“S&P”) placed its BB- rating on KCS and KCSM on
CreditWatch with negative implications and Moody’s
Investors Service (“Moody’s) placed all of KCS’,
KCSR’s and KCSM’s debt ratings under review for
possible downgrade.

KCS and KCSR Enter Into Agreement to Form Joint Venture
with Norfolk Southern Corporation.

On December 1, 2005,
KCS and its wholly-owned subsidiary The Kansas City Southern
Railway Company entered into a transaction agreement (the
“Transaction Agreement”) with Norfolk Southern
Corporation (“NS”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary The
Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company providing for, among
other things, the formation of a joint venture between the
parties relating to the ownership and improvement of the rail
line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana
(the “JV Line”), which is a portion of the rail line
between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian
Speedway.”

Upon consummation of the transaction contemplated by the
Transaction Agreement, the parties will form a new joint venture
limited liability company (the “JV Company”) to which
KCS will contribute the assets comprising the JV Line in
exchange ultimately for a 70% equity interest and NS will
contribute $300 million in cash in exchange ultimately for
a 30% equity interest. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction
Agreement, NS’ $300 million investment in the JV
Company will be used for mutually agreed-upon capital
improvements to expand capacity, for capital maintenance
projects and to reimburse KCS for certain previously-made
expenditures on the JV line.

Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the JV
Company and KCSR will enter into an operating agreement pursuant
to which KCSR will perform all railroad services on behalf of
the JV Company. The parties will also enter into a joint use
agreement whereby NS will be the sole provider for certain
intermodal traffic moving on the JV Line. KCS’ rail
subsidiaries also will have certain trackage rights over the JV
Line. In addition, the parties will enter into a joint marketing
agreement with respect to the movement of certain domestic
intermodal containers that move over the Meridian Speedway with
a lift or drop at KCS’ Dallas Intermodal Terminal.

The transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement are
subject to regulatory approvals, which could take six to twelve
months, and other customary closing conditions.

KCS Completes Acquisition of KCSM.

On April 1, 2005,
KCS completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in KCSM
from TMM. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, KCS
acquired all of TMM’s interest in KCSM for
$200.0 million in cash, 18 million shares of KCS
common stock, a $47.0 million two-year promissory note, and
up to $110.0 million payable in a combination of cash and
KCS common stock contingent upon the final resolution of the VAT
lawsuit and the Mexican government’s Put claim, as
described below.

Final Resolution of Value Added Tax (“VAT”) Lawsuit
and Contingency Payment under the Acquisition Agreement.

On
September 12, 2005, the Company and its subsidiaries, KCSM
and Grupo TFM, along with TMM, entered into a settlement
agreement with the Mexican government, resolving the
controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
the obligation (“Put”) to purchase the remaining
shares of KCSM owned by the Mexican government. As a result of
this settlement, KCS and its subsidiaries now own 100% of Grupo
TFM and KCSM. The potential obligation of KCS, Grupo TFM and TMM
to acquire the Mexican government’s remaining 20% ownership
of KCSM has been eliminated, and the legal obligation of the
Mexican government to issue the VAT refund to KCSM has been
satisfied. There was no cash



exchanged between the parties to the settlement agreement. In
addition, the parties entered into mutual releases of all
existing and potential claims relating to the VAT refund and the
Put obligation, and entered into an agreement to dismiss all of
the existing litigation between the parties.

As a result of the VAT/ Put Settlement, KCS recorded a pretax
gain of $131.9 million net of certain fees and expense paid
to consultant and net of a $9.0 million contingency fee to
Jose F. Serrano International Business, S.A. de C.V.
(“JSIB”) payable on final resolution of the VAT claim
and Put. Also as a result of the final resolution of the VAT
claim and Put, KCS was required to make an additional payment of
$110.0 million to TMM in accordance with the terms of the
December 15, 2004 Amended and Restated Acquisition
Agreement in a combination of cash, stock and notes. On
March 13, 2006 in settlement of the $110.0 million
obligation to TMM, KCS paid $35 million in cash, issued
1,494,469 shares of KCS Common Stock at the VWAP price of
$23.4197, as determined in connection with the Acquisition
Agreement, and issued a $40 million, five year note. As
settlement of its $9.0 million obligation to JSIB, KCS paid
$9 million in cash to JSIB.

KCS Completes Sale and Issuance of Preferred Stock.

On
December 9, 2005, KCS completed the sale and issuance of
$210.0 million of its 5.125% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock Series D at its liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share. KCS used substantially all of the net
proceeds of the offering to repurchase 9.0 million
shares of its common stock formerly owned by TMM which are
currently held as treasury shares.

KCSR Credit Agreement Amendments and Waivers.

On
September 30, 2005, KCS, KCSR, and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a second amendment and waiver of its credit
agreement dated March 30, 2004 (the “Credit
Agreement”). The Credit Agreement was amended to increase
the revolving credit facility commitment by $25.0 million
to a total available line of credit of $125.0 million. The
borrowing spread on the revolving credit facility was reduced by
50 basis points, while the borrowing spread on the term
loan facility was reduced by 25 basis points (based on
certain financial statement attributes). The revolving credit
facility has a maturity date of March 20, 2007, while the
term loan facility has a maturity date of March 20, 2008.
Additionally, the capital expenditure limit was eliminated and
certain other nonmaterial changes were made to the Credit
Agreement as part of the amendment.

On November 4, 2005, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a third amendment of the Credit Agreement. The
Credit Agreement was amended to modify the definition of
“EBITDA” in order to exclude from the definition
certain non-cash charges not to exceed $35.7 million in the
aggregate for the fiscal quarter ending on September 30,
2005, with respect to an increase in claim reserves.

On December 8, 2005, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a third waiver of the Credit Agreement. The
provisions of Section 5.02(g) of the Credit Agreement were
waived in order to permit KCS to use substantially all of the
net proceeds from the issuance of its 5.125% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock Series D to repurchase shares
of its common stock.

On March 1, 2006, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a fourth waiver of the Credit Agreement (the
“Fourth Waiver”). Under the terms of the Fourth
Waiver, which expires on April 30, 2006, the Lenders have
agreed to waive the requirement that KCS, as defined in the
Credit Agreement, maintain a leverage ratio of not more than
5.00:1 for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, provided
that such ratio does not exceed 5.50:1.

On April 7, 2006, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a fifth waiver of the Credit Agreement (the
“Fifth Waiver”). Under the terms of the Fifth Waiver,
which expires on April 30, 2006, the Lenders have agreed to
waive the requirement of Section 5.03(b) that KCS furnish a
copy of its 2005 annual audited financial statements by
March 31, 2006 so long as KCS furnishes such audited
financial statements by April 30, 2006.

On March 17, 2006, KCSR entered into a commitment letter
(the “Commitment Letter”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia
(“Scotia”) under which Scotia has agreed to provide
KCSR with a $371.2 million, fully underwritten, new credit
agreement to refinance KCSR’s existing Credit Agreement.
The new credit agreement will consist of a $246.2 million
term loan facility and a $125 million revolving credit
facility and



contain terms and conditions substantially similar to the Credit
Agreement, but will provide KCSR with additional financial
flexibility. The closing on the new credit agreement is expected
to occur before April 30, 2006. KCSR expects to be in
compliance with all of the covenants of the new credit
agreement, including the leverage ratio, throughout its term.

A further consequence of the late filing of our Annual report on
Form 10-K is that the ability of KCS to access quickly the
public equity markets has been reduced significantly, since KCS
is no longer qualified as a “well-known seasoned
issuer” and also cannot utilize the short-form registration
statement on Form S-3. These restrictions will continue for
12 months following this filing.

KCSM New Credit Agreement.

On October 24, 2005, KCSM
entered into a new credit agreement (the “2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement”) in an aggregate amount of up to
$106 million with Bank of America, N.A., BBVA Bancomer,
S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero
BBVA Bancomer, and the other lenders named in the 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement consists of a
$30 million revolving credit facility and a
$76 million term loan facility and is secured by the
locomotives and rail cars owned by Arrendadora. Proceeds from
the credit agreement were used by KCSM to pay all amounts
outstanding under the Bridge Loan Agreement dated
September 15, 2005, to pay all remaining amounts
outstanding under the $186.4 million First Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 24, 2004, and
for other general corporate purposes. The maturity date for the
credit facility is October 28, 2008. The 2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit certain
actions by KCSM, including, but not limited to, its ability to
incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make prepayments of
particular debt, pay dividends, make investments, engage in
transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital
stock, sell certain assets, and engage in mergers and
consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions. Except for
certain circumstances, KCSM’s capital expenditures may not
exceed certain amounts for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters. In addition, KCSM must meet certain consolidated
interest coverage ratios, consolidated leverage ratios, and
fixed charge coverage ratios. Failure to maintain compliance
with covenants would constitute a default. Other events of
default include, but are not limited to, certain payment
defaults, certain bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings, a
change of control, and certain adverse judgments or government
actions. Any event of default could trigger acceleration of the
time for payment of any amounts outstanding under the 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement.

On April 7, 2006 KCSM entered into an amendment and waiver
(“Amendment and Waiver”) to the 2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement was amended to
(i) exclude certain payment obligations accrued under two
locomotive maintenance agreements and under a track maintenance
rehabilitation agreement from the definition of Indebtedness,
(ii) eliminate certain minimum and multiple borrowing
thresholds for peso borrowings under the revolving credit
facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting requirement to
provide unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
fourth fiscal quarter. The Amendment and Waiver also waived
(x) certain reporting requirements, including the requirement of
KCSM to provide audited consolidated financial statements within
90 days after the end of the 2005 fiscal year, provided
such reports are delivered by April 30, 2006 and (v)
compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio obligations of
Section 7.1(c) of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement for the
four quarters ending December 31, 2005 if compliance
therewith was calculated without giving effect to the amendment
to the definition of “Indebtedness” in the Amendment
and Waiver,

provided

that KCSM is in compliance therewith
after giving effect to the Amendment and Waiver.

KCSR Completes Successful Consent Solicitation.

On
June 10, 2005, KCSR completed the successful solicitation
of consents to amend the indentures, as supplemented where
applicable, under which KCSR’s outstanding


/


% Senior
Notes due 2008 and outstanding


/


% Senior Notes due 2009 were issued. KCSR received
the requisite consents from a majority of the holders of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of notes.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Consent Solicitation Statement dated May 11, 2005 and as
thereafter amended, KCSR, KCS, the other note guarantors, and
the trustee under each of the indentures, respectively, signed
supplemental indentures with respect to each such series of



notes to permit KCS, Grupo TFM, and KCSM to effect a settlement
of certain disputes among KCSM, Grupo TFM, and the Mexican
government.

KCSM Completes Note Tender Offer and Consent
Solicitation.

On April 1, 2005, KCSM commenced a cash
tender offer for any and all outstanding $443.5 million
aggregate principal amount of 11.75% Senior Discount
Debentures due 2009 (the “2009 Debentures”) on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in KCSM’s
Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated
April 1, 2005. KCSM also solicited consents for amendments
to the indenture under which the 2009 Debentures were issued.
Holders who tendered their 2009 Debentures were required to
consent to the proposed amendments and holders who consented
were required to tender their 2009 Debentures.

On April 14, 2005 $386.0 million principal amount of
the outstanding $443.5 million principal amount of the 2009
Debentures had been tendered on or prior to the consent deadline
pursuant to the consent solicitation and tender offer for the
2009 Debentures, representing approximately 87% of the
outstanding 2009 Debentures. As a result of such consents and
early tenders, KCSM received the requisite consents to execute a
supplemental indenture relating to the 2009 Debentures. As part
of its tender offer for the 2009 Debentures, KCSM was soliciting
consents to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive
covenants included in the indenture under which the 2009
Debentures were issued and to reduce the minimum prior notice
period with respect to a redemption date for outstanding 2009
Debentures from 30 to 3 days. The supplemental indenture
relating to the 2009 Debentures containing the proposed changes
was executed by KCSM and the Trustee under the indenture. KCSM
made payment for these 2009 Debentures pursuant to the early
tender provisions of the tender offer on April 20, 2005.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2009 Debentures, as amended by the
supplemental indenture, KCSM called for redemption all of its
remaining outstanding 2009 Debentures that were not tendered in
KCSM’s previously announced tender offer and on
April 29, 2005, paid an aggregate of $60.0 million,
including principal and interest, to the holders of such 2009
Debentures to complete the redemption of all of such remaining
outstanding 2009 Debentures.

KCSM Issues New Senior Notes.

On April 19, 2005,
KCSM issued $460.0 million principal amount of


/


% senior
notes due 2012 (the
“9


/


% Senior
Notes”). The


/


% Senior
Notes are denominated in U.S. Dollars, bear interest
semiannually at a fixed rate of


/


%
and mature on May 1, 2012. The


/


% Senior
Notes are redeemable, at KCSM’s option, in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, on and after May 1,
2009, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice.
Subject to certain conditions, up to 35% of the principal amount
of the


/


% Senior
Notes is redeemable prior to May 1, 2008. In addition, the


/


% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole but not in
part, at KCSM’s option at 100% of their principal amount,
together with accrued interest, in the event of certain changes
in the Mexican withholding tax rate.

The


/


% Senior
Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of KCSM, rank
pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of KCSM, and are senior to
all of its subordinated debt. The


/


% Senior
Notes effectively rank junior to all of KCSM’s secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness. The


/


% Senior
Notes are not guaranteed by any of KCSM’s subsidiaries and
are therefore effectively subordinated to all liabilities of
KCSM’s subsidiaries. The


/


% Senior Notes are not guaranteed by Grupo TFM.

In connection with the


/


% Senior
Notes, on April 19, 2005, KCSM entered into a registration
rights agreement with the placement agents engaged in the
offering of the


/


% Senior
Notes, or the Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, KCSM agreed, for the
benefit of the holders of the


/


% Senior Notes, at the cost to KCSM, to use its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) file a registration statement with respect to a
    registered offer to exchange the


/


% Senior
    Notes for new exchange notes having terms identical in all
    material respects to the


/


% Senior Notes (except that the exchange notes will
    not contain transfer restrictions); and

(ii) complete the registered exchange offer within
    270 days after the closing date of the offering of the


/


% Notes of April 19, 2005.



KCSM filed the registration statement and completed the
registered exchange offer in accordance with the terms of the
Registration Rights Agreement.

On April 18, 2005, KCSM entered into a first waiver and
amendment (the “Waiver and Amendment”) to its First
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 24,
2004, with the banks which are a party thereto and
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The
Waiver and Amendment allowed KCSM to issue the


/


% Senior
Notes in a principal amount in excess of the principal amount of
2009 Debentures outstanding and to use the amount of proceeds
from the private placement of the


/


% Senior
Notes in excess of the principal amount of the 2009 Debentures
outstanding to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the 2009
Debentures repurchased or redeemed, to pay the fees of the
underwriter associated with the issuance of the


/


% Senior
Notes as well as the tender offer for the 2009 Debentures, to
pay the premium related to the tender offer and to pay certain
other expenses relating to the tender offer and issuance of the


/


% Senior Notes. The Waiver and Amendment also
amended the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to allow
KCSM to borrow up to $25 million from KCS on a fully
subordinated basis.

As mentioned above, KCSM refinanced the first Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement with proceeds from the 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement on October 24, 2005.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

In connection with the
expiration of the Rights Agreement, dated as of
September 19, 1995, between the Company and Harris
Trust & Savings Bank, as Rights Agent, which associated
Rights (as defined therein) expired on October 12, 2005,
the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to replace
its rights plan. The Company entered into a Rights Agreement
with UMB Bank, n.a., dated as of September 29, 2005 (the
“Rights Agreement”). The Board of Directors of the
Company declared a dividend distribution of one Right for each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock to stockholders of
record at the close of business on October 12, 2005 (the
“Record Date”). Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from the Company


/


ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock
(“Preferred Stock”), or in some circumstances, shares
of the Company’s Common Stock, other securities, cash or
other assets, at a purchase price of $100 per share. Both
shares and purchase rights are subject to adjustment as further
described in Part II Item 8, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data —
Note 2 — Stockholder Rights Plan” to the
Financial Statements.

The Rights, may have the effect of impeding a change in control
of the Company without the prior consent of the Board, and the
Rights could cause substantial dilution to a person that
attempts to acquire the Company, without conditioning the offer
on redemption of the Rights by the Board, or on the acquisition
by such person of a substantial number of Rights. The Rights
will not interfere with any Permitted Offer for all of the
outstanding Common Stock that has the approval of a majority of
the Independent Directors.

Tex-Mex enters into Loan Agreement.

On July 13,
2005, Tex-Mex entered into an agreement with the Federal
Railroad Administration (“FRA”) with an effective date
of June 28, 2005 to borrow $50.0 million to be used
for infrastructure improvements. These improvements are expected
to increase efficiency and capacity in order to accommodate
growing freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA corridor. The
interest rate under the loan agreement is 4.29% and the
principal balance amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of
July 13, 2030. At December 31, 2005, Tex-Mex had
borrowed $21.7 million under the loan agreement. Tex-Mex
expects to draw down the remaining available principal balance
during 2006. The loan is being made under the Railroad
Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (“RRIF”)
Program administered by the FRA. The loan is guaranteed by
Mexrail, which has issued a Pledge Agreement in favor of the
lender equal to the gross revenues earned by Mexrail on per-car
fees charged for traffic crossing the International Rail Bridge
located in Laredo, Texas.

Purchase of Locomotives.

In September 1999, KCSM entered
into a locomotive operating lease agreement covering 75
locomotives that was to expire in 20 years. The lease
agreement contained standard provisions for this type of
transaction, including the option to either purchase the assets
or return the assets to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
Because the lease agreement contained above market rates, in
connection with the valuation of KCSM assets as part of the
Acquisition and the principles of push down



accounting, KCSM recorded a valuation reserve that was being
amortized over the remaining life of the lease.

On November 2, 2005, KCSR entered into an agreement with
El-Mo-Mex, Inc. (“El-Mo”) to acquire El-Mo’s
equity interest in the leased locomotives. KCSR and an affiliate
paid cash in the amount of approximately $32.6 million and
assumed approximately $95.9 million of debt and accrued
interest to acquire the locomotives. KCSR subsequently purchased
the locomotives from the affiliate. On December 20, 2005,
KCSR entered into a leveraged lease arrangement, treated for
financial reporting purposes as an operating lease, with an
unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to the terms of this
leveraged lease, KCSR was to sell the locomotives to a trust,
which would then lease the locomotives to KCSR for a period of
18 years. The trust also would assume the debt assumed by
KCSR in its purchase of the locomotives. Prior to year end, KCSR
had completed the sale of 54 of the locomotives to the trust.
The remaining 19 units (two of the original 75 were
determined to be damaged beyond repair), valued at
$32.5 million, were sold to the trust in January 2006 and
are included in the December 31, 2005 financial statements
as property.

KCSR Branch Line Lease Agreement.

On July 20, 2005,
KCSR and Watco Companies announced the lease of five of
KCSR’s branch lines in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Alabama to three subsidiary railroads of Watco,
a short line railroad company. These lease agreements are for a
period of ten years, subject to earlier termination in
accordance with the terms of the applicable lease agreement. The
lease agreements are renewable for an additional ten years upon
mutual agreement by KCSR and the applicable Watco subsidiary.
Under the lease agreements, these branch lines will continue to
receive rail service, but from the three railroads owned by
Watco instead of KCSR. KCSR will bill the revenue on its traffic
and pay a per car fee to Watco for the services provided. In
addition, the lessee has agreed to pay KCSR annually, additional
rent for the leased property in an amount based on the
lessee’s revenue derived from the leased property that is
received from traffic interchanged to carriers other than KCSR
for the annual period for which the lease amounts are due and
Watco is required to provide certain limited capital
expenditures on the branch lines as well as assume
responsibility for the maintenance.

Loss of Foreign Private Issuer Status for Grupo TFM and
KCSM.

Effective April 1, 2005, KCS acquired a
controlling interest in Grupo TFM and KCSM. As a consequence of
this change in control, Grupo TFM and KCSM have each ceased to
qualify as a foreign private issuer for purposes of their
reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
or SEC. Accordingly, Grupo TFM and KCSM have begun filing
current reports on
Form

8-K,

quarterly reports on
Form

10-Q

(beginning with respect to the second fiscal quarter of 2005)
and will begin filing annual reports on
Form

10-K

(beginning with respect to fiscal year 2005).

Calculation of Employee Statutory Profit Sharing.

From
1997 until 2001, KCSM calculated the net taxable income that
should be considered for employee statutory profit sharing under
a judicial ruling that allowed it to deduct net operating
losses, or NOLs, that had been carried forward from prior years.
In 2002, the relevant legal provision was modified and KCSM
sought another judicial ruling confirming its right to deduct
NOLs from previous years. Due to a series of decisions in 2005
by the Mexican Supreme Court declaring that NOLs from previous
years may not be deducted, KCSM changed the method of
calculating its statutory profit sharing liability. KCSM no
longer deducts NOLs from prior years when calculating employee
statutory profit sharing. This change required KCSM to write off
its deferred tax assets related to statutory profit sharing
resulting in a charge to operating expenses of
$35.6 million, after purchase accounting adjustments.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Net Income.

Consolidated net income for 2005 increased
$76.5 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of a
$131.9 million gain resulting from the VAT/ Put Settlement,
partially offset by a reduction



in operating income of $21.2 million. Additionally,
consolidated net income increased due to a reduction in
provision for income taxes of $30.7 million.

The reduction in consolidated operating income was driven
primarily by an additional $37.8 million charge in 2005 to
recognize additional costs related to occupational and personal
injury claims determined as a result of our annual actuarial
study, which was completed during the third quarter of 2005, and
the write off of KCSM’s deferred tax asset related to
statutory profit sharing. On a consolidated basis, both revenues
and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the
acquisitions completed during the year. In addition to the
acquisitions, revenue growth for 2005 continued to be driven by
increased volume, targeted rate increases and increased fuel
surcharges to help offset rising fuel prices. Consolidated
operating costs generally increased consistent with the volume
increases, although price increases also impacted compensation
and benefits and fuel expense.

The following table summarizes the consolidated income statement
components of KCS

(in millions).

Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes to the current
period presentation.



U.S. Results

U.S. Revenues.

The following table summarizes
U.S. revenues, including the revenues and separate carload
statistics of KCSR, and Mexrail, for the year ended
December 31, 2005

(in millions).

For the year ended
December 31, 2004 the revenue and carload statistics are
KCSR only. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current period presentation.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, U.S. revenues
increased $164.9 million. The Mexrail acquisition accounted
for $73.3 million of the increase in revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2005. U.S. revenue also experienced
increases in all commodity groups due to a combination of higher
carloadings, targeted price improvements and increased fuel
surcharge revenue. Fuel surcharges increased to
$52.0 million, which accounted for $35.3 million of
the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to the same periods in 2004. Fuel surcharges will
increase or decrease dependent on the price of West Texas
Intermediate Crude Oil as published in the Wall Street Journal.
The following discussion provides an analysis of our revenues by
commodity group. Pending completion of the ongoing effort to
change the TexMex mark and finalize its merger into KCS
operations, carload data is presented based on the combination
of the carloads for KCSR and Mexrail, without elimination for
cars interchanged between the two roads.

Chemical and petroleum products.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, U.S. chemical and petroleum
products experienced increases in revenues in all commodity
groups with the exception of inorganic chemicals. These
increases were attributed to higher production, certain targeted
rate increases and fuel surcharges. These revenue increases were
partially offset by the effects of plant and production
shutdowns resulting from the hurricanes during the second half
of 2005. The impact of the Mexrail consolidation increased
revenues $12.1 million in the chemical and petroleum
product commodities for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Forest products and metals.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, forest products and metals revenue for
the U.S. segment experienced growth in all commodities
compared to the same period in 2004. For the year to date
period, these increases resulted primarily from certain targeted
rate increases and fuel surcharges partially offset by the
impact of hurricanes in the 3rd quarter of 2005. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the consolidation of Mexrail
contributed $19.0 million, to forest products and metals
revenue.

Agricultural and mineral products.

U.S. revenues in
the agricultural and mineral products business unit increased
for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increases were
primarily the result of targeted rate increases and fuel
surcharges. Additionally, for the year ended December 31,
2005, all commodities, except grain, experienced increased
traffic due to increased production. U.S. segment domestic
grain



carloads decreased, primarily due to a slowdown in equipment
cycle times resulting in lower equipment availability for the
year while the impact of local harvests moving to local feed
mills reduced traffic in the third quarter of 2005 compared to
the same period in 2004. Export grain carloads decreased
primarily as a result of a decrease in gulf coast export traffic
including the effects of hurricane weather in the gulf coast
region. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
consolidation of Mexrail contributed $30.7 million to
agricultural and mineral products revenue.

Intermodal and automotive.

Revenue for U.S. segment
intermodal and automotive commodity group for the year ended
December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in
2004. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Mexrail,
intermodal traffic declined for the year ended December 31,
2005. The declines were the result of changes in shipper traffic
patterns as well as the effects of hurricane weather during the
third quarter of 2005. Automotive traffic decreased as a result
of decreased volumes from manufacturers for the year ended
December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31,
2005, the consolidation of Mexrail contributed $5.5 million
to intermodal and automotive products revenue.

Coal.

Increases in U.S. segment coal revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same
period in 2004 were due primarily to the addition of two new
coal customers that were previously served by other railroads,
certain targeted rate increases related to renegotiated
contracts and overall increases in carloadings and traffic
volumes at certain electric generating stations in response to
demand. Mexrail has no significant coal revenues.

U.S Operating Expenses.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, U.S. operating expenses increased
$203.3 million (36.6%), when compared to the same period in
2004. Of this increase, $83.3 million was attributable to
the consolidation of Mexrail’s operations for the year
ended December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes
U.S. operating expenses of KCSR and Mexrail for the year
ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended
December 31, 2004 the operating expenses are KCSR only.

Compensation and Benefits.

Increases in compensation and
benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the same period in 2004 were primarily the result of
annual wage and salary rate increases which were effective
July 1, 2004 as well as higher employee counts. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the consolidation of Mexrail
added $19.4 million to compensation and benefits expense.
The average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2005
was approximately 3,060 compared to approximately 2,740 for the
same period in 2004, including an increase of employees as a
result of the consolidation of Mexrail.

Purchased Services.

Purchased services expense for the
year ended December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same
period in 2004, primarily as a result of the consolidation of
Mexrail’s operations. Mexrail has historically contracted
for services in the maintenance of equipment and way and
structures. Accordingly, Mexrail contributed $19.7 million,
to purchased services expense for the year ended
December 31, 2005.



Fuel.

Fuel expense increased for the year ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This
increase was the result of a 50.5% increase in the average price
per gallon, as well as a 26.0% increase in consumption. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the consolidation of Mexrail
added $11.9 million to fuel expense.

Equipment Costs.

Equipment costs for the year ended
December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in
2004. Of this increase, $15.2 million was related to the
Mexrail acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Excluding the impact of the Mexrail acquisition, equipment costs
increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily as
a result of increased equipment lease costs related to higher
traffic levels and demand.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and
amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2005
increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a
result of a higher asset base, partially offset by property
retirements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
consolidation of Mexrail added $3.5 million to depreciation
and amortization expense.

Casualties and Insurance.

During the third quarter of
2005, the Company recorded a $37.8 million pre-tax charge
reflecting changes in its estimates for the cost of personal
injury claims and includes $7.5 million related to the
Company’s first actuarial estimate of the cost of incurred
but not reported occupational illness claims. The charge was
recorded in “Casualties and Insurance” expense.

The majority of the increases for FELA and third party claims
are attributable to adverse experience occurring since last
year’s study, including an increase in the number of new
claims and unforeseen adverse developments in the dollar amount
of claims and potential settlements for many significant prior
claims. The reserve for occupational illness claims resulted
primarily from the first time actuarial study. The Company is
continuing its practice of accruing monthly for estimated claim
costs at levels recommended by the actuarial study, and those
accruals have been increased accordingly.

Overhead Capitalization.

KCS capitalizes certain overhead
costs representing the indirect costs associated with
construction and improvement projects. Overhead factors are
periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs. As
a result of revisions to rates used to capitalize indirect costs
during the quarter ended June 30, 2005, operating expenses
were reduced by approximately $1.8 million. Similarly, in
the fourth quarter, the overhead allocation was reviewed to
ensure that all appropriate current year costs were allocated
which resulted in a reduction of operating expenses of
approximately $3.0 million

Mexico Results.

KCS acquired a controlling interest in KCSM effective
April 1, 2005. The nine month period ended
December 31, 2005 results reflect charges and costs
associated with the Acquisition and integration, as well as the
effect of valuation adjustments as required by purchase
accounting. Management evaluates the results of its Mexico
operations based on its operating performance during the current
year and comparison to plan.



Mexico Revenues.

The following table summarizes
consolidated Mexico revenues, including the revenues and
carloads statistics, for the nine month periods ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004. Although not consolidated in
previous years, revenue recognition policies for our Mexico
operations were consistent with those of U.S. operations in
all material respects; therefore, commodity statistics are
presented for purposes of comparison. Unaudited results for the
nine months ended December 31, 2004 presented for
comparative purposes.

Revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2005
totaled $547.6 million compared to $510.5 million for
the same period in 2004 resulting in an increase of
$37.1 million. This increase was primarily attributable to
the impact of fuel surcharges $23.9, million which
increased $21.5 million over the nine months ended
December 31, 2004, and increases in other factors of
$15.6 million.

Chemical and Petrochemical Products.

Revenues from
chemical and petrochemical products during the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, decreased from the same period in 2004
primarily due to disruptions related to the impact of hurricanes
offset by increases in Mexican domestic revenues for the same
period, related primarily to higher consumption of fuel products.

Forest products and metals.

Domestic revenues increased
during the nine months ended December 31, 2005 as a result
of an increase in the production volumes of construction
materials such as billets, bar and wire. Steel slab and steel
coils revenue decreased as a result of lower international
traffic, related to reduced consumption by manufacturing
industries offset in part by certain targeted rate increases and
fuel surcharges.

Agriculture and mineral.

Revenues from agriculture
products increased during the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the same periods in 2004. The
increases were primarily the result of targeted rate increases
and fuel surcharges. Volume increases were seen in corn and
sugar partially offset by reductions in import shipments of
soybeans, sorghum and wheat products during the nine months
ended December 31, 2005.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Intermodal freight revenue
increased $1.6 million for the nine month period ended
December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. This
increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation of
steamship service at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas with
the support of the port administration and Hutchinson Terminal.
Automotive revenues for the nine month period ended
December 31, 2005 decreased primarily as a consequence of
lower domestic traffic offset by targeted increases in rates.



Mexico Operating Expenses.

Mexico operations reported
operating income of $17.2 million in the nine months ended
December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes operating
expenses of KCSM for the nine months ended December 31:

In connection with the evaluation of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities of Grupo TFM, certain assets were
identified as having little or no value to KCS as the acquiring
Company. Because KCS acquired 48.5% of Grupo TFM (or 38.8% of
KCSM) in this transaction, the allocation of the excess purchase
price over book value of net assets was limited to the acquired
percentage. Accordingly, a reduction in the assets of Grupo TFM
was limited to acquired percentage and any residual was charged
to expense. Grupo TFM operating expenses include
$41.1 million relating to decreases in the basis of certain
assets, the most significant of which was the write off of
deferred employee profit sharing asset of approximately
$35.6 million as a result of recent legal rulings in
Mexico. A total of $15.9 million of these operating
expenses were allocated to Grupo TFM’s minority shareowner.

As a result of the resolution of the VAT refund claim and Put
obligation on September 12, 2005, KCS and its subsidiaries
now own 100% of Grupo TFM; the potential obligation of KCS,
Grupo TFM and TMM to acquire the Mexican government’s
remaining 20% ownership of KCSM has been eliminated; and the
legal obligation of the Mexican government to issue the VAT
refund to KCSM has been satisfied. Resolution of the
preacquisition contingency related to the April 1, 2005
transaction and KCSM’s exchange of the VAT for the book
value of the minority interest resulted in an approximate
$70.1 million decrease in the basis of the assets to
reflect fair value.

Consolidated Interest Expense.

Consolidated interest
expense increased $89.1 million for year ended
December 31, 2005 when compared to the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004. This increase was the result of higher
floating interest rates incurred under our Credit Agreement,
increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility,
interest associated with the debt assumed as part of the
locomotive acquisition from El-Mo and the addition of interest
expense of $71.4 million for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 due to the Acquisition of KCSM and
$1.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31,
2005 due to the acquisition of Mexrail.

Consolidated Debt Retirement Costs.

Consolidated debt
retirement costs increased $0.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period in 2004.
For the year to date ended, December 31, 2005,
$4.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs were
written off primarily in connection with the refinancing of
KCSM’s 2009 Debentures and its First Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of June 24, 2004. During the year
to date period ended December 31, 2004, KCS recorded
$4.2 million of debt retirement costs resulting from the
write-off of the unamortized balance of debt issuance costs
associated with our previous credit facility.

Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
Affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2005,
equity in earnings from other unconsolidated affiliates was
$3.9 million compared to equity in losses



from other unconsolidated affiliate of $2.1 million for the
same period of 2004. Significant components of this change were
as follows:

•

For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity in losses from
    the operations of PCRC was $1.7 million, compared to
    $2.1 million for the same period in 2004.

•

For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity in earnings of
    Southern Capital was $2.8 million, compared to
    $2.7 million, for the same period in 2004.

•

For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, KCSM’s
    equity in earnings of Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de
    México, S.A. de C.V. (“FTVM”) was
    $2.9 million.

For 2005, earnings for Southern Capital were $13.1 million
compared to $11.8 million in 2004. This increase of
$1.3 million was primarily the result of a gain recognized
by Southern Capital for the sale of locomotives in 2005 of
approximately $7.7 million as compared to $6.0 million
in 2004. The sales of locomotives were to KCSR in the second
quarters of 2005 and 2004 respectively. For purposes of
recording its share of Southern Capital earnings, the Company
has recorded its share of the gain as a reduction to the cost
basis of the equipment acquired. As a result, the Company will
recognize its equity in the gain over the remaining depreciable
life of the locomotives as a reduction of depreciation expense.

Consolidated Income Tax Provision (Benefit).

For the year
ended December 31, 2005, KCS’s income tax benefit was
$7.1 million, a change of $30.7 million as compared to
a $23.6 million expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004. This change was primarily due to the
complexities relating to Mexico taxes resulting in an effective
income tax rate of (9.3%) and 49.1% for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The primary
causes of the decrease in the consolidated effective rate were
the VAT/ Put Settlement, the utilization of U.S. tax
credits enacted for the tax year 2005, a lower Mexican statutory
tax rate of 30% as compared to U.S. statutory rate of 35%,
and foreign exchange rate fluctuations and inflation. The VAT/
Put Settlement gain was not taxable in Mexico and is not
expected to be taxable for U.S. income tax purposes. The
Company believes, based upon opinions of outside legal counsel
and other factors, that the VAT/ Put Settlement should not be
taxable to KCS for U.S. income tax purposes. Such position
has not been examined by taxing authorities and it is possible
that this position could be challenged. The amount of such tax
would be material; however the Company believes that it would
have the right to indemnification under the terms of the
Acquisition Agreement.

KCS intends to indefinitely reinvest the equity earnings from
KCSM and accordingly, does not provide deferred income tax
expense for the excess of its book basis over the tax basis of
its investment in KCSM.



YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED WITH THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Net Income.

Net income for the year ended
December 31, 2004 increased $12.2 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase of
$54.4 million in operating income was partially offset by a
net decrease in other nonoperating income and expense items of
$6.9 million, a $26.4 million increase in the
provision for income taxes, and the impact of an
$8.9 million cumulative effect of accounting change, net of
income taxes in the first quarter of 2003.

The following table summarizes the income statement components
of KCS

(in millions):

nm — not meaningful percentage change in excess of 500%



Revenues.

The following table summarizes consolidated KCS
revenues, including the revenues and carload statistics of KCSR,
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes
in the business groups and to conform to the current period
presentation.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated revenues
increased $58.2 million. Freight revenues included fuel
surcharges of

$

16.7 million compared with
$4.4 million in the prior year. Fuel surcharges will
increase or decrease dependent on the price of West Texas
Intermediate Crude Oil as published in the Wall Street Journal.
KCSR experienced revenue increases in the chemical and
petroleum, forest products and metals, and agriculture and
mineral products, and intermodal commodity groups while coal
revenues were relatively flat. For most commodity groups, these
increases in revenue resulted from higher carloadings and
targeted price improvements. The following discussion provides
an analysis of KCSR revenues by commodity group.

Chemical and petroleum products.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCSR recorded higher revenues for all
commodities within the chemical and petroleum products group.
Revenue increases for petroleum, agricultural chemicals and
industrial gases were primarily the result of targeted rate
increases as well as increased traffic volumes. While some new
business was added in 2004, increased volumes from existing
customers driven by improvements in the economy accounts for the
majority of the volume change. Excluding organic chemicals,
revenue per carload (RPC) increased 6.6% over 2003. Organic
chemical revenues increased primarily as a result of increased
traffic, partially offset by lower RPC due to shorter hauls and
changes in commodity mix.

Forest products and metals.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCSR recorded higher revenues for all
forest products and metal commodities compared to 2003. Revenue
increases for all commodities in the group resulted from certain
targeted rate increases, fuel surcharges, and increased volume
attributed to higher production and service improvements.
Volumes for lumber and plywood products experienced growth as a
result of a robust housing industry and hurricane reconstruction
in Florida. Wet weather in other areas of the country
contributed to a rise in traffic for pulpwood, logs and chip.
Military and other carloads increased due to strong traffic
during the second half of 2004 as a result of increased
movements for military installations serviced by KCSR.

Agricultural and mineral products.

Revenues in all
commodities in the agricultural business unit increased due to
targeted rate increases and fuel surcharges resulting in an
overall RPC increase of 8.5%.



Carload volumes increased in all commodities except for food and
kindred. For the year ended December 31, 2004, increases in
revenues for domestic grain were a direct result of increased
production of feed mills on KCSR’s line. Export grain
revenues for 2004 versus 2003 improved as a result of increased
volumes related to the shipment of current year grain harvests
to ports in the Gulf of Mexico, combined with strong increases
in export volumes to Mexico. Ores and minerals revenue and
stone, clay and glass revenues increased during 2004 as a result
of higher production by certain customers, as well as certain
targeted rate increases and fuel surcharges. Food and kindred
product revenues increased primarily as a result of longer hauls
to domestic destinations.

Intermodal and automotive.

Intermodal revenues increased
as a result of higher volumes from existing customers, as well
as the generation of new intermodal business. Automotive traffic
increased partially as a result of a temporary shift in traffic
from Ford Motor Company and increased volumes from GM and Mazda.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in haulage
revenue per car resulting from a change in the traffic mix.

Coal.

Revenues for coal for the year ended
December 31, 2004 decreased due primarily to lower traffic
volumes at certain electric generating stations. These

year-to

-year decreases
were partially offset by increased traffic in the fourth quarter
of 2004 related to new business, as well increased production at
other electric generating stations.

Operating Expenses.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, consolidated operating expenses increased
$3.8 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2003. The following table summarizes KCS’s consolidated
operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

Compensation and Benefits.

Compensation and benefits
expense increased $15.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result
of annual wage and salary rate increases, higher crew starts
related to higher traffic volume and increased incentive
compensation. Average headcount for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was 2,740 compared to 2,676 for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Purchased Services.

Purchased services expense for the
year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $1.2 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 resulting from
lower levels of equipment repairs partially offset by increases
in infrastructure repairs performed by outside parties and
higher legal costs related to claim settlements.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased $19.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. Increases of 30.2% in average price per
gallon and 6.8% in consumption were offset in part by fuel cost
savings of $3.0 million as a result of our fuel hedging
program and improved fuel purchasing and distribution procedures
implemented through our new Heavener, Oklahoma fueling facility.
The 6.8% increase in consumption was a direct result of
increased traffic, as gallons per gross ton mile remained
unchanged from 2003 to 2004 at 1.37. Fuel cost represented
approximately 11.9%



of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to 8.6% of operating costs and expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Equipment Costs.

Equipment costs for the year ended
December 31, 2004 decreased $7.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease was
primarily due to continued efficiency gains in KCSR’s rail
operations combined with an increase in car hire receivable for
KCSR rolling stock on foreign lines and the 2004 acquisition of
locomotives from Southern Capital, which were previously under
lease.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and
amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2004
decreased $10.8 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of changes in
depreciable lives and salvage values approved by the STB and
which took effect on January 1, 2004. These decreases were
partially offset by increases in the property base as a result
of capital expenditures.

Casualties and Insurance.

Casualties and insurance
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased
$14.0 million compared to the year ended December 31,
2003. Casualties and insurance expense was significantly
impacted in 2003 as a result of a $21.1 million provision
in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding this provision, the
$7.1 million increase in casualties and insurance was
primarily the result of a $5.0 million derailment in
Bolton, Mississippi in September 2004. Casualties and insurance
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the
net effect of approximately $4.4 million in insurance
settlements.

Other Leases.

Other lease expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004 increased $2.0 million compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003, related to pipeline rents
for KCSR’s new fuel facility in Heavener, Oklahoma.
Additionally, KCSR experienced normal rate increases in
long-term leases.

Operating Income.

Consolidated operating income for the
year ended December 31, 2004 increased $54.4 million
to $83.5 million compared to $29.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Accordingly, KCS experienced
a reduction in its consolidated operating ratio (ratio of
operating expenses to operating revenues) of 8.1 basis
points to 86.9% in 2004 from 95.0% in 2003. This decrease was
the result of a $58.2 million increase in revenue,
partially offset by a corresponding $3.8 million increase
in operating expenses.

Interest Expense.

Consolidated interest expense for the
year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $2.0 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. This
reduction was primarily the result of decreased balances on
higher fixed rate debt instruments and lower average interest
rates related to the Credit Facility.

Debt Retirement Costs.

During the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCS recorded $4.2 million of debt
retirement costs resulting from the write-off of the unamortized
balance of debt issuance costs associated with our previous
credit facility.

Other Income.

Increases in KCS’s other income for
the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily the result
of interest on tax refunds received in 2004 related to certain
prior year tax returns as well as fluctuations in gains on sales
of non-operating property.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit).

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, KCS’s income tax provision was
$23.6 million, an increase of $26.4 million compared
to a $2.8 million benefit for the year ended
December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a
$47.5 million increase in income before income taxes,
resulting in an effective income tax rate of 49.1% and (600.7)%
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The primary cause of the increase in the effective
rate was the increase in KCS pre-tax earnings, excluding equity
in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, of
$50.4 million in 2004 compared to a pre-tax loss of
$11.8 million in 2003, resulting in a consolidated
effective income tax rate of 46.8% for 2004 compared to 23.8%
for 2003. KCS intends to indefinitely reinvest the equity
earnings from KCSM and accordingly, does not provide deferred
income tax expense for the excess of its book basis over the tax
basis of its investment in KCSM.



Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
Affiliates.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, KCSM’s operating results and KCS’s corresponding
equity in earnings under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) were as follows

(in
millions):

The increase in KCSM operating expenses was driven primarily by
increases in fuel costs of $19.2 million partially offset
by decreases in other operating expenses. Net income of KCSM was
significantly impacted by a $4.7 million income tax
provision (U.S. GAAP) compared to a $51.5 million
income tax benefit for 2003. This net increase in the tax
provision was largely driven by tax legislation passed in the
fourth quarter of 2004 that lowered future corporate income tax
rates in Mexico. As a result of this legislation, the value of
certain net deferred tax assets was adjusted to reflect lower
values resulting in a charge to the tax provision of
$23.7 million. KCSM’s principal deferred tax assets
are the result of prior year net operating losses for income tax
purposes. KCSM’s tax provision for 2004 was also impacted
by changes in the peso/dollar exchange rate as well as
adjustments for inflation within the Mexican economy.

Prior to 2005, KCSM reported its financial results under
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
Because we were required to report our equity in net earnings in
KCSM under U.S. GAAP and KCSM reported under IFRS,
differences in deferred income tax calculations and the
classification of certain operating expense categories occurred.
The deferred income tax calculations are significantly impacted
by fluctuations in the relative value of the Mexican peso versus
the U.S. dollar and the rate of Mexican inflation, and can
result in significant variability in the amount of equity
earnings reported by KCS. Additionally, in 2004, KCSM recognized
a loss, net of tax and minority interest, of $4.2 million
on the sale of its interest in Mexrail to KCS. For purposes of
recording our equity in the net losses of KCSM, this loss was
eliminated due to the sale being to KCS, a related party.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, equity in losses from
other unconsolidated affiliates was $2.1 million compared
to equity in losses from other unconsolidated affiliates of
$1.3 million in 2003. Significant components of this change
were as follows:

•

For 2004, KCS recorded equity in losses of $2.1 million
    from PCRC compared to $3.1 million for 2003 as PCRC
    continued to operate below full capacity due to delays in the
    completion of port expansion in Balboa.

•

Equity in losses of $2.7 million from KCS’s investment
    in Mexrail. For 2003 and the first half of 2004, Mexrail’s
    results were consolidated into the results of KCSM.

•

Equity in earnings from Southern Capital of $2.7 million
    compared to $1.8 million in 2003.

For 2004, earnings for Southern Capital were $11.8 million
compared to $4.1 million in 2003. This increase of
$7.7 million was primarily the result of the recognition by
Southern Capital of an approximate $6.0 million gain
related to the sale of locomotives to KCSR in the second quarter
of 2004. For purposes of recording its share of Southern Capital
earnings, the Company has recorded its share of the gain as a
reduction to the cost basis of the equipment acquired. As a
result, the Company will recognize its equity in the gain over
the remaining depreciable life of the locomotives as a reduction
of depreciation expense.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change.

The Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (“SFAS 143”) effective
January 1, 2003. As a result, the Company changed its
method of accounting for removal costs of certain track
structure assets and recorded a one-time benefit of
$8.9 million (net of income taxes of



$5.6 million) during the first quarter of 2003. This change
is reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in
the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

KCS is a highly leveraged company. Our primary sources of
liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, borrowings
under our revolving credit facilities and access to debt and
equity capital markets. Although we have had excellent access to
capital markets, as a highly leveraged company the financial
terms under which we obtain funding often contain certain
restrictive covenants. Our covenants restrict or prohibit
certain actions, including, but not limited to, our ability to
incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make prepayments of
particular debt, pay dividends, make investments, engage in
transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital
stock, sell certain assets, and engage in mergers and
consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions. These
covenants restrict our financial flexibility. As of
December 31, 2005, our total available liquidity, defined
as the cash balance plus revolving credit facility availability,
was approximately $68 million. On March 31, 2006 in
settlement of our obligations to TMM and JSIB, KCS paid
$44 million in cash and other considerations. These cash
payments reduced our available liquidity.

As a result of KCS acquiring a controlling interest in Grupo TFM
and KCSM, both companies became subject to the terms and
conditions of the indentures governing KCSR’s two senior
notes issues. The restrictive covenants of these indentures
limit the ability of Grupo TFM and KCSM to incur additional
debt. Grupo TFM and KCSM can only incur debt to refinance
existing debt.

For the four quarters ended December 31, 2005, KCS’
consolidated coverage ratio (EBITDA/ interest expense), as
defined and measured under the KCSR senior notes indentures, was
less than 2.00:1. A ratio of less than 2.00:1 restricts
KCS’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, with certain
exceptions including borrowings under our revolving credit
facility, and pay cash dividends under the terms of the
indentures. We anticipate that our ability to incur additional
indebtedness and pay cash dividends will remain restricted by
the coverage ratio until the end of the third quarter of 2006.

For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005, KCS
did not meet the leverage ratio covenant (debt/ EBITDA) of
5.00:1 as defined and measured under the terms of its credit
agreement dated March 30, 2004 (the “Credit
Agreement”). On March 1, 2006 KCS, KCSR and other KCS
subsidiaries entered into a fourth waiver of its Credit
Agreement (the “Fourth Waiver”). Under the terms of
the Fourth Waiver, which expires on April 30, 2006, the
Lenders have agreed to waive the requirement that the KCS, as
defined by the Credit Agreement, maintain a leverage ratio of
not more than 5.00:1 for the quarter ended December 31,
2005, provided that such ratio does not exceed 5.50:1.

On March 31, 2006, KCS failed to meet certain reporting
requirements under the Credit Agreement. This failure resulted
in a default under the Credit Agreement and limited KCSR’s
access to the revolving credit facility. On April 7, 2006,
KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries entered into a fifth waiver
of the Credit Agreement (the “Fifth Waiver”). Under
the terms of the Fifth Waiver, which expires on April 30,
2006, the Lenders have agreed to waive the requirement of
Section 5.03(b) that KCS furnish a copy of its 2005 annual
audited financial statements by March 31, 2006 so long as
KCS furnishes such audited financial statements by
April 30, 2006. We are not currently in default of the
Credit Agreement and currently have access to the revolving
credit facility.

On March 17, 2006 KCSR entered into a commitment letter
(the “Commitment Letter”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia
(“Scotia”) under which Scotia has agreed to provide
KCSR with a $371.2 million, fully underwritten, new credit
agreement to refinance KCSR’s existing Credit Agreement.
The new credit agreement will consist of a $246.2 million
term loan facility and a $125 million revolving credit
facility and contain terms and conditions substantially similar
to the Credit Agreement, but will provide KCSR with additional
financial flexibility. The closing on the new credit agreement
is expected to occur before April 30, 2006. KCSR expects to
be in compliance with all of the covenants of the new credit
agreement throughout its term, including the leverage ratio.



For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2005, KCSM
did not meet the leverage ratio covenant (debt/ EBITDA) of
4.50:1 as defined and measured under the terms of its credit
agreement dated October 24, 2005 (the “2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement”). In addition, on March 31, 2006,
KCSM failed to meet certain reporting requirements under the
2005 KCSM Credit Agreement. These failures resulted in defaults
under the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement and limited KCSM’s
access to the revolving credit facility. On April 7, 2006
KCSM entered into an amendment and waiver (“Amendment and
Waiver”) to the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement was amended to (i) exclude certain payment
obligations accrued under two locomotive maintenance agreements
and under a track maintenance rehabilitation agreement from the
definition of Indebtedness, (ii) eliminate certain minimum
and multiple borrowing thresholds for peso borrowings under the
revolving credit facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting
requirement to provide unaudited consolidated financial
statements for the fourth fiscal quarter. The Amendment and
Waiver also waived (x) certain reporting requirements,
including the requirement of KCSM to provide audited
consolidated financial statements 90 days after the end of
the 2005 fiscal year, provided such reports are delivered by
April 30, 2006 and (y) compliance with the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio obligations of Section 7.1(c)
of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement for the four quarters ending
December 31, 2005 if compliance therewith was calculated
without giving effect to the amendment to the definition of
“Indebtedness” in the Amendment and Waiver,

provided

that KCSM is in compliance therewith after
giving effect to the Amendment and Waiver. KCSM is not currently
in default of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement and currently has
access to the revolving credit facility.

We believe, based on current expectations, that our cash and
other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to capital
markets, and other available financing resources will be
sufficient to fund anticipated operating, capital and debt
service requirements and other commitments through 2006. A
consequence of the late filing of our Annual report on
Form 10-K is that the ability of KCS to access quickly the
public equity markets has been reduced significantly, since KCS
is no longer qualified as a “well-known seasoned
issuer” and also cannot utilize the short-form registration
statement on Form S-3. These restrictions will continue for
12 months following this filing. Our operating cash flow
and financing alternatives, however, can be unexpectedly
impacted by various factors, some of which are outside of our
control. For example, if we were to experience a substantial
reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating
costs or other liabilities, our operating cash flows could be
significantly reduced. Additionally, we are subject to economic
factors surrounding capital markets and our ability to obtain
financing under reasonable terms is subject to market
conditions. Further, our cost of debt can be impacted by
independent rating agencies, which assign debt ratings based on
certain credit measurements such as interest coverage and
leverage ratios.

During 2005, subsequent to the VAT/ Put Settlement, both
Standard & Poor’s Rating Service
(“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service
(“Moody’s”) removed their negative outlook on our
debt rating and moved our outlook to stable. On March 23,
2006, S&P Rating Service placed our preferred stock ratings
on CreditWatch with negative implications. This rating action
was taken after we announced that KCS failed to meet the
consolidated coverage ratio threshold under the KCSR senior
notes indentures that would allow us to pay cash dividends on
our Preferred Stock. On April 4, 2006 S&P placed its
BB- ratings on KCS and KCSM on CreditWatch with negative
implications and lowered the Company’s preferred stock
ratings to CCC from B-. The preferred stock credit ratings
remain on CreditWatch with negative implications. The rating
actions followed recent negative developments, including the
delay in filing our Annual Reports on
Form

10-K,

and to
reflect an increased risk of KCS failing to make the next
dividend payment on its preferred stock as a result of the
special meeting being adjourned indefinitely. S&P placed the
corporate credit and other ratings on CreditWatch on concerns
about the Company’s liquidity in the wake of these events.
S&P has indicated that the preferred stock ratings would
likely be lowered to ‘D’ if the May 15, 2006
dividend payment is missed. All ratings could be lowered if the
Company fails to address liquidity concerns or fails to
demonstrate the likelihood of improved financial results over
the near to intermediate term.



On April 5, 2006 Moody’s Investors Service
(“Moody’s”) placed all of KCS’, KCSR’s
and KCSM’s debt ratings under review for possible
downgrade. Moody’s review was prompted by KCS’
inability to file this 2005
Form

10-K

by
March 31, 2006.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated
cash position decreased by $7.5 million from
December 31, 2004. This resulted primarily from an
increased level of capital expenditures. During the year ended
December 31, 2004, our consolidated cash position decreased
by $96.8 million from December 31, 2003. This resulted
primarily from an increased level of investments in affiliates.
The primary sources of cash were cash inflows from operating
activities, the issuance and assumption of long-term debt, the
issuance of preferred stock and borrowings under our revolving
credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were for capital
expenditures, investments in affiliates, repayment of long-term
debt and the repurchase of our common stock.

KCS’s cash flow from operations has historically been
positive and sufficient to fund operations, KCSR roadway capital
expenditures, other capital improvements and debt service.
During 2005, KCSR used borrowings under its revolving credit
facility to fund an expanded capital expenditure program.
External sources of cash (principally bank debt, public debt,
preferred stock and leases) have been used to refinance existing
indebtedness and to fund acquisitions, new investments and
equipment additions.



Operating Cash Flows.

The following table summarizes
consolidated operating cash flow information for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively:

(dollars in millions)

Net operating cash flows for 2005 increased $36.1 million
to $178.8 million compared to $142.7 million in 2004.
This increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
to the consolidation of KCSM which was partially offset by
changes in working capital balances relating to the timing of
payments and receipts.

Net operating cash flows for 2004 increased $74.7 million
to $142.7 million compared to $68.0 million in 2003.
This increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
to an increase in net income, distributions from unconsolidated
affiliates, the increase in deferred tax expense recognized in
2004, the impact of certain tax benefits related to stock
options and changes in working capital balances relating to the
timing of payments and receipts, as well as the discharge of
certain non-current liabilities.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash outflows were
$289.5 million and $376.8 million during the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This
$87.3 million decrease was related to the investments in
Mexrail and Grupo TFM in 2004. During 2005, KCS capital
expenditures increased by approximately $158.5 million, of
which KCSM contributed $72.0 million and Mexrail
contributed $28.6 million. KCS also incurred approximately
$10.1 million of costs associated with the Acquisition of
Grupo TFM in 2005 as compared to $9.5 million in 2004.

Net investing cash outflows were $376.8 million and
$86.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. This $290.8 million increase in
investing cash outflows was primarily related to the
$200 million of restricted cash placed in an escrow account
for investment in Grupo TFM and the $32.7 million
investment in Mexrail during 2004, as well as an increase of
$33.2 million in capital expenditures. During 2003, in
contemplation of the Acquisition, KCS repurchased a 51% interest
in Mexrail for $32.7 million. In accordance with a demand
from KCSM, KCS sold its interest in Mexrail back to KCSM on
September 30, 2003 for $32.7 million. As a result of
these two Mexrail transactions in 2003, there was no net impact
to net investing cash outflows during 2003. Also impacting net
investing cash outflows for 2004 and 2003 were approximately
$9.5 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of costs
associated with the Acquisition that were deferred and included
in other investing activities.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows were derived
from the issuance of long-term debt, including borrowings under
our revolving credit facilities, the issuance of preferred stock
and proceeds from



the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
Financing cash outflows were used for the repayment of debt, the
repurchase of our common stock, the payment of dividends on our
preferred stock and the payment of debt and preferred stock
issuance costs. Financing cash flows for 2005, 2004, and 2003
were as follows:



Contractual Obligations.

The following table outlines our
material obligations under long-term debt, operating lease and
other contractual commitments at December 31, 2005.
Typically, payments for operating leases, other contractual
obligations and interest on long-term debt are funded through
operating cash flows. Principal payment obligations on long-term
debt are typically refinanced by issuing new long-term debt. If
operating cash flows are not sufficient, funds received from
other sources, including borrowings under credit facilities and
proceeds from property and other asset dispositions might also
be available. These obligations are customary transactions
similar to those entered into by others in the transportation
industry. We anticipate refinancing certain parts of our
long-term debt prior to maturity.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As further described in Note 3 to KCS’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K,

we hold
a 50% interest in Southern Capital, a joint venture that
provides us with access to equipment financing alternatives.
Southern Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition
of locomotives, rolling stock and other railroad equipment and
the leasing thereof to KCSR. On June 25, 2002, Southern
Capital refinanced the outstanding balance of certain debt
through the issuance of 5.7% pass through trust certificates and
proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. These pass through
trust certificates are secured by all of the locomotives and
rolling stock owned by Southern Capital and rental payments
payable by KCSR under the operating leases of the equipment
owned by Southern Capital. As Southern Capital is a 50% owned
unconsolidated joint venture, this debt is not reflected in
KCS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, which are included in
Item 8 of this
Form

10-K.

Also, as described in Note 3 to KCS’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K,

under
the terms of the loan agreement with International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”), we are a guarantor for up to
$5.6 million of associated debt. Also, if PCRC terminates
the concession contract without the IFC’s consent, we are a
guarantor for up to 50% of the outstanding senior loans.
Furthermore, we are a guarantor for up to $3.0 million of
the equipment loans and approximately $100,000 relating to the
other capital leases.

On March 28, 2005, PCRC and the IFC finalized an agreement
whereby PCRC would redeem the shares subscribed and owned by the
IFC pursuant to the IFC Subscription. Under the agreement, PCRC
paid to the IFC $10.5 million. These shares had a recorded
value of $5.0 million and approximately $2.6 million
in accrued unpaid dividends. Upon completion of the transaction,
PCRC recorded additional cost of approximately $2.9 million
to reflect the premium paid to IFC and, as a result, KCS
recorded its share of the transaction cost of approximately
$1.5 million through its equity in earnings of PCRC in the
first quarter of 2005.

As previously described, on November 2, 2005, KCSR entered
into an agreement with El-Mo-Mex, Inc. (“El-Mo”) to
acquire El-Mo’s equity interest in the leased locomotives.
KCSR and an affiliate paid cash in the amount of approximately
$32.6 million and assumed approximately $95.9 million
of debt and



accrued interest to acquire the locomotives. KCSR subsequently
purchased the locomotives from the affiliate. On
December 20, 2005, KCSR entered into a leveraged lease
arrangement, treated for financial reporting purposes as an
operating lease, with an unaffiliated third party.

Capital Expenditures

Capital improvements for KCSR roadway track structures have
historically been funded with cash flows from operations. In
2005, we used proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility to finance an expanded capital program. We have
historically used internally generated cash flows or leasing for
equipment capital expenditures. Through our Southern Capital
joint venture, we have the ability to finance railroad
equipment, and therefore, have increasingly used lease-financing
alternatives for our locomotives and rolling stock.

The following table summarizes the cash capital expenditures by
type for KCSR and Mexrail for the year ended December 31,
2005 and KCSM for the nine months ended December 31, 2005.
For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 the cash
capital expenditures are for KCSR only.

Maintenance & Repairs

KCSR and KCSM, like other railroads, are required to maintain
their own property infrastructure. Portions of roadway and
equipment maintenance costs are capitalized and other portions
are expensed (as components of material and supplies, purchased
services and others), as appropriate. Maintenance and capital
improvement programs are in conformity with the standards
promulgated by the applicable regulatory agency and are
accounted for in accordance with applicable regulatory
accounting rules. We expect to continue funding roadway and
equipment maintenance expenditures with internally generated
cash flows.

Shelf Registration Statements and Public Securities
    Offerings

Kansas City Southern currently has three shelf registration
statements on file with the SEC (“Initial
Shelf” — Registration
No.

33-69648;

“Second Shelf” — Registration
No.

333-61006;

“Third Shelf” — Registration
No.

333-130112).

Securities in the aggregate amount of $300 million remain
available under the Initial Shelf and securities in the
aggregate amount of $450 million remain available under the
Second Shelf. The Third Shelf was filed in accordance with the
securities offering reform rules of the SEC that allow well
known seasoned issuers to register an unspecified amount of
different types of securities on an immediately effective
Form

S-3

registration statement. On December 9, 2005, the Company
completed the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its
Convertible Preferred Stock Series D pursuant to the Third
Shelf. See Item 5 “Market for KCS’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities” for a detailed discussion of the terms
of the Convertible Preferred Stock Series D and the
offering. There remains an unspecified amount of securities
available under the Third Shelf. To date, no securities have
been issued under either the Initial Shelf or Second Shelf. As a
consequence of the late filing of this 2005 Form 10-K, KCS
will be ineligible to use any of these shelf registration
statements until it has timely filed all periodic reports
required under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
Act for twelve months from the date of filing this 2005
Form 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’s accounting and financial reporting policies are in
conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Management believes that the
following accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
understanding of KCS’s historical and future performance.
Management has discussed the development and selection of the
following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
of KCS’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has
reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of our
critical accounting policies and estimates.



Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment

The railroad industry is extremely capital intensive.
Maintenance and the depreciation of operating assets constitute
a substantial operating expense for KCS, as well as the railroad
industry as a whole. We capitalize costs relating to additions
and replacements of property, plant and equipment, including
certain overhead costs representing the indirect costs
associated with construction and improvement projects. Overhead
factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect
current costs. All of these costs are depreciated using the
group method consistent with industry standards and rules
established by the STB. The cost of property, plant and
equipment normally retired, less salvage value, is charged to
depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating
assets using group straight-line rates for financial statement
purposes. The STB approves the depreciation rates used by KCSR
(excluding the amortization of computer software) but not for
KCSM. Both KCSR and KCSM periodically conduct studies of
depreciation rates for properties and equipment and implements
approved changes, as necessary, to depreciation rates. These
studies take into consideration the historical retirement
experience of similar assets, the current condition of the
assets, current operations and potential changes in technology,
estimated salvage value of the assets, and industry regulations.
For all other consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is derived
based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation is
based upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as
their net salvage value at the end of their useful lives.
Estimation of the useful lives of assets that are long-lived as
well as their salvage value requires significant management
judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting
estimates related to depreciation expense are critical.

Currently, KCSR and KCSM depreciate operating assets, including
road and structures, rolling stock and equipment, and
capitalized leases generally over a range of 3 to 50 years
depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset. We
amortize computer software over a range of 3 to 12 years
depending upon the estimated useful life of the software. In
addition to the adjustment to rates as a result of the
depreciation studies, certain other events could occur that
would materially affect the Company’s estimates and
assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in
operations or technology could substantially alter our
assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return of our
investment in operating assets and, therefore, affect the amount
of depreciation expense to charge against both current and
future revenues. Because depreciation expense is a function of
analytical studies made of property, plant and equipment,
subsequent studies could result in different estimates of useful
lives and net salvage values. If future depreciation studies
yield results indicating that our assets have shorter lives as a
result of obsolescence, physical condition, changes in
technology or changes in net salvage values, the estimate of
depreciation expense could increase. Likewise, if future studies
indicate that assets have longer lives, the estimate of
depreciation expense could decrease.

KCSR Depreciation Study.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, changes were made to certain KCSR
depreciation rates. As described above, depreciation is computed
using group straight-line rates for financial statement
purposes, which require approval of the STB. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the KCSR engaged a civil
engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage to
conduct a study to evaluate depreciation rates for properties
and equipment. The study centered on evaluating actual
historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
indicated that KCSR was depreciating its property over shorter
periods than we actually utilize the assets, as estimated by the
study. Specifically, the average rate applied to the Road and
Structures Asset class (primarily rail, railroad ties and
bridges) decreased approximately 0.7%, while the average rate
applied to the Rolling Stock and Equipment Asset class
(locomotives and railcars) decreased approximately 0.5%. The
effect of this change in estimate on net income was
approximately $8.0 million, net of tax of $5.0 million
($0.12 per share, on a diluted basis), for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the group depreciation
method for consistency with KCSR. Accordingly, changes were made
to certain historical depreciation rates. Unlike KCSR, KCSM
depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the STB,
accordingly, the changes to the depreciation rates were applied
in 2005. During the year ended



December 31, 2005, the KCSM engaged a civil engineering
firm with expertise in railway property usage to conduct an
analysis of depreciation rates for properties and equipment. The
analysis centered on evaluating actual historical replacement
patterns to assess future lives and indicated that KCSM was
depreciating its property over shorter periods than we actually
utilize the assets. As a result, depreciation expense recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2005 reflected an adjustment totaling
$5.5 million, to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in
the second and third quarters of 2005. Concession rights and
related assets are amortized over the shorter of their remaining
useful life as determined by the KCSM depreciation review or the
life of the concession.

Provision for Environmental Remediation

Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. The major environmental laws
to which we are subject include, among others, the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), the
Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
CERCLA can impose joint and several liabilities for cleanup and
investigation costs, without regard to fault or legality of the
original conduct, on current and predecessor owners and
operators of a site, as well as those who generate, or arrange
for the disposal of, hazardous substances. The risk of incurring
environmental liability is inherent in the railroad industry. We
own property that is, or has been, used for industrial purposes.
Use of these properties may subject KCS to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of
contaminants, claims alleging personal injury, or property
damage as the result of exposures to, or release of, hazardous
substances.

KCS conducts studies, as well as site surveys, to determine the
extent of environmental damage and the necessary requirements to
remediate this damage. These studies incorporate the analysis of
our internal environmental engineering staff and consultation
with legal counsel. From these studies and surveys, a range of
estimates of the costs involved is derived and a liability and
related expense for environmental remediation is recorded within
this range. Our recorded liabilities for these issues represent
our best estimates (on an undiscounted basis) of remediation and
restoration costs that may be required to comply with present
laws and regulations. These estimates are based on forecasts of
the total future direct costs related to environmental
remediation. These estimates change periodically as additional
or better information becomes available as to the extent of site
remediation required, if any. In addition, advanced technologies
related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
and anticipated cost can influence these estimates. Certain
changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates
and assumptions related to costs for environmental remediation.
If KCS becomes subject to more stringent environmental
remediation costs at known sites, if we discover additional
contamination, discover previously unknown sites, or become
subject to related personal or property damage, KCS could incur
material costs in connection with its environmental remediation.
Accordingly, management believes that estimates related to the
accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to
our results of operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the expense related
to environmental remediation was $2.1 million and is
included as purchased services expense on the consolidated
statements of income. Additionally, as of December 31,
2005, KCS has a total liability recorded for environmental
remediation of $5.8 million including liabilities assumed
in connection with the Mexrail acquisition of $2.8 million.
This amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates
based upon the studies and site surveys described above and in
accordance with SFAS 5. As of December 31, 2005 there
were no accrued liabilities relating to environmental
remediation at KCSM.

Provision for Casualty Claims

Due to the nature of U.S. railroad operations, claims
related to personal injuries and third party liabilities
resulting from crossing collisions and derailments, as well as
claims related to personal property damage and other casualties
is a substantial expense to KCS. Claims are estimated and
recorded for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred
but not reported (“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent



with the general practice within the railroad industry, our
estimated liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially
determined on an undiscounted basis. In estimating the liability
for casualty claims, we obtain an estimate from an independent
third party actuarial firm, which calculates an estimate using
historical experience and estimates of claim costs as well as
numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the
derivation of an estimate of future claim costs. Employees are
compensated for work related personal injury claims according to
provisions contained within the Federal Employers’
Liability Act (“FELA”).

Reserves for occupational illness claims were previously
established through an assessment made on a case-by-case basis,
and a liability was established when management determined that
it was probable and reasonably estimable. No provision was made
for occupational illness claims that may have been incurred but
not yet reported, since the Company believed the low end of the
range of reasonably possible loss was not material. During 2005
the Company experienced a marked increase in the number of such
claims. In light of these developments, the Company requested
and obtained an actuarial study of these potential unasserted
claims for the first time. The study indicated that existing
reserves should be increased by $7.5 million.

Personal injury and casualty claims are subject to a significant
degree of uncertainty, especially estimates related to IBNR
personal injuries for which a party has yet to assert a claim
and, therefore, the degree to which injuries have been incurred
and the related costs have not yet been determined. In
estimating costs related to casualty claims, management must
make assumptions regarding future costs. The cost of casualty
claims is related to numerous factors, including the severity of
the injury, the age of the claimant, and the legal jurisdiction.
In deriving an estimate of the provision for casualty claims,
management must make assumptions related to substantially
uncertain matters. Changes in the assumptions used for actuarial
studies could have a material effect on the estimate of the
provision for casualty claims. Management believes that the
accounting estimate related to the liability for personal
injuries and other casualty claims is critical to our results of
operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, casualty expense was
approximately $57.6 million and was included in casualties
and insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Based on the methods described above and information available
as of December 31, 2005, our liability for casualty claims
was $103.9 million. For the year ended December 31,
2005, the provision for casualty expense represented 8.1% of
consolidated operating expenses. For purposes of earnings
sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2005 reserve were
adjusted (increased or decreased) 10%, casualty expense would
have changed $10.4 million.

Provision for Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of KCS.
For financial reporting purposes, management determines our
current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of
accounting for income taxes as specified in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109

“Accounting
for Income Taxes.”

The provision for income taxes is
the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred into
the future. Currently payable income taxes represent the
liability related to KCS’s U.S., state and Mexican income
tax returns for the current year and anticipated tax payments
resulting from income tax audits while the net deferred tax
expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of
deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance
sheet. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based upon the changes in differences between the
basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as
measured using the enacted tax rates that management estimates
will be in effect when these differences reverse. In addition,
the tax provision for Mexico is further complicated by the
impacts of inflation as well as the exchange rate, both of which
can have a significant impact on the calculation. In addition to
estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of
tax differences, management must also make certain assumptions
regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary. If
the differences are temporary, management must estimate the
timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income
in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any
gross deferred



tax assets of KCS. Accordingly, management believes that the
estimates related to the provision for income taxes is critical
to our results of operations

OTHER

Derivative Instruments.

KCS does not engage in the
trading of derivatives. Our objective for using derivative
instruments is to manage our fuel and interest rate risk to
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in fuel prices and interest
rates. We account for derivative transactions under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended,
as set forth in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K.

In
general, we enter into derivative transactions in limited
situations based on management’s assessment of current
market conditions and perceived risks. Management intends to
respond to evolving business and market conditions in order to
manage risks and exposures associated with our various
operations, and in so doing, may enter into such transactions
more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

Fuel expense is a
significant component of our operating expenses. Fuel costs are
affected by (i) traffic levels, (ii) efficiency of
operations and equipment, and (iii) fuel market conditions.
To stabilize the price for future fuel purchases and protect our
operating results against adverse fuel price fluctuations, from
time to time, KCS enters into transactions, such as forward
purchase commitments and commodity swap transactions. These
derivative instruments hedge against fluctuations in the price
of No. 2 Gulf Coast Heating Oil, the commodity on which
KCSR’s diesel fuel prices are determined. Using certain
risk management strategies, we are able to reduce our risk
related to rising diesel fuel prices. At December 31, 2005
we had no outstanding fuel hedges.

Foreign Exchange Matters.

In connection with our
acquisition of KCSM, matters may arise with respect to financial
accounting and reporting for foreign currency transactions and
for translating foreign currency transactions into
U.S. dollars. KCS follows the requirements outlined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52
“Foreign Currency Translation”
(“SFAS 52”), and related authoritative guidance.
KCSM uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
Earnings (losses) from KCSM included in our results of
operations reflect any such transaction gains and losses that
KCSM records in the process of translating certain transactions
from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars. We continue to evaluate
existing alternatives with respect to utilizing foreign currency
instruments to hedge our U.S. dollar investment in KCSM as
market conditions change or exchange rates fluctuate. At
December 31, 2005 we had no outstanding foreign currency
hedging instruments.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal
proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are of an
ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
current and former employees for job related injuries and by
third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. We
aggressively defend these matters and have established liability
reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected
costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any
legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s
management, other than those proceedings described in detail
below, such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or
in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition.

Reinsurance Litigation.

The Company has established its
personal injury and casualty reserves based on an assumption
that it will have the benefit of insurance under existing
policies. Several reinsurers of the Company’s captive
insurer have filed a declaratory judgment action in federal
court in Vermont seeking a declaration that based on a claimed
lack of notice, they have no obligation to provide coverage for
a set of lawsuits currently pending against a subsidiary of the
Company. The Company’s captive insurer has answered and
filed a counterclaim to establish its right to coverage. The
Company presently believes that it has a strong basis to
establish that notice was properly delivered and that it has a
right to coverage. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in
the litigation with the reinsurance carriers and the damages in
the underlying litigation exceed the self insured retention, the
Company would not have reinsurance to cover such excess. While
the Company is not presently able to reliably estimate such
amounts, those additional amounts could be material. In the
event the Company is unsuccessful in the reinsurance



litigation, the Company believes it would have a strong claim
against third parties responsible for providing notice to the
reinsurers for any damages caused by the loss of the insurance
coverage. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any accruals related to the possible lack of insurance coverage
from the reinsurers.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
inherent market risks. Generally, these instruments have not
been entered into for trading purposes. The following
information, together with information included in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in this
Form

10-K

and
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K,

which
are hereby incorporated by reference, describe the key aspects
of certain financial instruments that have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our floating-rate indebtedness totaled $440.9 million and
$249.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Our two credit agreements, each comprised of a
revolving credit facility and a term loan facility, contain
variable rate debt which accrues interest based on target
interest indexes (e.g., London Interbank Offered
Rate — “LIBOR,” federal funds rate, etc.)
plus an applicable spread, as set forth in each credit
agreement. Given the balance of $440.9 million variable
rate debt at December 31, 2005, we are sensitive to
fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical
100 basis points increase in each of the respective target
interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of
approximately $4.4 million on an annualized basis for the
floating-rate instruments held by KCS as of December 31,
2005.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
maturities, the fair value of our long-term debt was
approximately $1,938.6 million at December 31, 2005
and $704 million at December 31, 2004.

Commodity Price Sensitivity

As described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Other — Derivative
Instruments” of this
Form

10-K,

KCS
periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and
swap transactions. At December 31, 2005, KCS was not a
party to any fuel swap agreements. Subsequent to
December 31, 2005 KCS entered into fuel swap agreements for
3.2 million gallons. We also hold fuel inventories for use
in operations. These inventories are not material to our overall
financial position. With the exception of the fuel currently
hedged under fuel swap transactions for 2006, fuel costs are
expected to mirror market conditions in 2005. Assuming annual
consumption of 140 million gallons, a $0.10 change in the
price of fuel would result in an increase in operating expenses
of $14 million.



Foreign Exchange Sensitivity

In connection with our acquisition of KCSM, matters arise with
respect to financial accounting and reporting for foreign
currency transactions and for translating foreign currency
transactions into U.S. dollars. KCSM uses the
U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Earnings (losses)
from KCSM included in our results of operations reflect any such
translation gains and losses that KCSM records in the process of
translating certain transactions from Mexican pesos to
U.S. dollars. Therefore, we have exposure to fluctuations
in the value of the Mexican peso. While not currently utilizing
foreign currency instruments to hedge our U.S. dollar
investment in KCSM, we continue to evaluate existing
alternatives as market conditions and exchange rates fluctuate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or
“the Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

KCS’s internal control over financial reporting was
designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and board of directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of published financial statements.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, KCS
management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 based on the framework established by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(commonly referred to as the COSO framework).
Management’s assessment identified the following material
weakness in the Company’s internal control related to the
accounting for income taxes as of December 31, 2005:

The Company lacked sufficient personnel with adequate expertise
in accounting for income taxes, effective reconciliation
procedures related to income tax accounts, and sufficient
oversight of the income tax accounting function by management.
As a result, the Company is restating the opening retained
earnings balance for the year ended December 31, 2003 in
connection with issuing the 2005 consolidated financial
statements to reflect the correction of errors in the accounting
for income taxes. Additionally, a material misstatement was
identified in the income tax provision in the Company’s
2005 consolidated financial statements that was corrected prior
to the issuance of such financial statements.

Because of the material weakness described above, KCS management
concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
2005.

The Company acquired Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana,
S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo TFM”) and its subsidiary, Kansas
City Southern de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”) on
April 1, 2005. Management excluded from its assessment of
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 Grupo
TFM’s and KCSM’s internal control over financial
reporting, which represents 53% of the Company’s
consolidated total assets and 41% of the Company’s
consolidated total revenues included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an audit report on management’s assessment of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, on page 62 (Item 8) of this
Annual Report on
Form

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

(Item 8)

, that Kansas
City Southern and subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, because of the effect of the material
weakness identified in management’s assessment that the
Company’s controls and procedures over accounting for
income taxes were ineffective based on criteria established in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Kansas City Southern’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

The following material weakness has been identified and included
in management’s assessment:

The Company lacked sufficient personnel with adequate expertise
    in accounting for income taxes, effective reconciliation
    procedures related to income tax accounts and sufficient
    oversight of the income tax accounting function by management.
    As a result, the Company is restating the opening retained
    earnings balance for the year ended December 31, 2003 in
    connection with issuing the 2005 consolidated financial
    statements to reflect the correction of errors in the accounting
    for income taxes. Additionally, a material misstatement was
    identified in the income tax provision in the 2005 consolidated
    financial statements.



Because of this material weakness, there is more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement in the Company’s
annual or interim financial statements due to errors in
accounting for income taxes could occur and not be prevented or
detected by its internal control over financial reporting.

The Company acquired control of Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria
Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo TFM”) and its
subsidiary, Kansas City Southern de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
(“KCSM”) on April 1, 2005. Management excluded
from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 Grupo TFM’s and KCSM’s internal
control over financial reporting which represents 53% of the
Company’s consolidated total assets and 41% of the
Company’s consolidated total revenues included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31,
2005. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control
over financial reporting of Grupo TFM and KCSM.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.), the
consolidated balance sheets of Kansas City Southern and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. The
aforementioned material weakness was considered in determining
the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our
audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and this
report does not affect our report dated April 7, 2006,
which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of
the material weakness described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
issued by COSO.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Grupo
Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.
(Grupo TFM), a 46.6% owned investee company, as of
December 31, 2004 and for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003. The Company’s investment in Grupo TFM at
December 31, 2004 was $389.6 million, and its equity
in earnings (loss) of Grupo TFM was $(2.4) million and
$12.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The financial statements of Grupo TFM as
of December 31, 2004 and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 were audited by other auditors
whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion,
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Grupo TFM as
of December 31, 2004 and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, is based solely on the reports
of other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits, and the reports of other
auditors for 2004 and 2003, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Kansas City Southern and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company restated its balance sheet as of
December 31, 2004 and its statements of changes in
stockholders’ equity for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (U.S.), the
effectiveness of Kansas City Southern’s and subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated April 7, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Description of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
“Company”) is a Delaware corporation that was
initially organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc. In 2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas
City Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal
operations in rail transportation.

Until the second quarter of 2005, we operated under one
reportable business segment in the rail transportation industry.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, with the acquisition of
a controlling interest in Grupo TFM, we began operating under
two reportable business segments, which are defined
geographically as U.S. and Mexico. In both the U.S. and the
Mexico segments, we generate our revenues and cash flows by
providing our customers with freight delivery services both
within our regions, and throughout North America through
connections with other Class I rail carriers. Our customers
conduct business in a number of different industries, including
electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum products,
paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral products,
automotive products and intermodal transportation.

KCS’s principal geographic business segments include the
following:

U.S. Segment

Mexico Segment

•

Grupo Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana,, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Grupo TFM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, our Mexican
    holding company which owns all but one share of Kansas City
    Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”).

•

KCSM which is the principal operating subsidiary of Grupo TFM
    operates under the rights granted by the concession acquired
    from the Mexican government in 1997 (the KCSM Concession) as
    described below.

•

Arrendadora TFM, S.A. de C.V. (“Arrendadora”), is
    wholly-owned by Grupo TFM and KCSM and has as its only
    operation, the leasing to KCSM of the locomotives and freight
    cars acquired through the privatization and subsequently sold to
    Arrendadora by KCSM.

On April 1, 2005, KCS completed its acquisition of control
of Grupo TFM and as of that date, Grupo TFM became a
consolidated subsidiary of KCS. On September 12, 2005, the
Company and its subsidiaries, Grupo TFM and KCSM, along with the
Mexican holding company Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”),
entered into a settlement agreement with the Mexican government
resolving the controversies and disputes between the companies
and the Mexican government concerning the payment of a VAT
refund to KCSM and the purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM
owned by the Mexican government. As a result of this settlement,
KCS and its subsidiaries now own 100% of Grupo TFM and KCSM. For



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the first quarter of 2005, KCS accounted for its investment in
Grupo TFM on the equity basis of accounting. Grupo TFM and KCSM
constituted 53% of the Company’s consolidated assets at
December 31, 2005 and 41% of the Company’s
consolidated revenues for the fiscal year then ended.

The KCSM Concession

We hold a

50-year

concession, which took effect in June 1997 and is renewable
under certain conditions for additional periods of up to
50 years, to provide freight transportation services over
our rail lines. Our concession is exclusive for the first
30 years of our operations, subject to certain trackage
rights of Ferromex, Ferrosur, two short line railroads and

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México

, S.A de
C.V. (Mexico Valley Railroad and Terminal) (“FTVM”).
In conjunction with our concession, KCSM has the right to use,
during the full term of the concession, all track and buildings
that are necessary for our rail lines’ operation. Under the
terms of the concession, KCSM is required to pay the Mexican
government a concession duty equal to 0.5% of our gross revenues
during the first 15 years of the concession period and
1.25% of such revenues during the remainder of the period.

Under the concession and the Mexican railroad services law and
regulations, we may freely set our rates unless the Ministry of
Transportation, in consultation with the Mexican Antitrust
Commission, determines that there is no effective competition in
Mexico’s rail industry, taking into account alternative
rail routes and modes of transportation. We are required to
provide railroad services to all users on a fair and
non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and
safety standards approved periodically by the Ministry of
Transportation. In the event that we collect from customers
rates higher than the registered rates, we must reimburse those
customers with interest, and risk the revocation of the
concession.

Mexican railroad services law and regulations and the concession
establish several circumstances under which the concession will
terminate, including among others, revocation by the Ministry of
Transportation, voluntary surrender of our rights under the
concession, statutory appropriation or our liquidation or
bankruptcy. Specifically, as it relates to liquidity of the
railroad, the concession requires us to make investments and
undertake capital projects, including capital projects described
in a business plan filed every five years with the Mexican
government. We filed our second business plan with the Mexican
government in 2003. Under the terms of the plan, we have
committed to certain minimal investment and capital improvement
goals, which may be waived by the

Secretaría de
Comunicaciones y Transportes

(Mexican Communication and
Transportation Ministry (“SCT”) upon our application
for relief for good cause.

In the event that the concession is revoked by the Ministry of
Transportation, we will receive no compensation, and our rail
lines and all other fixtures covered by the concession, as well
as all improvements made by us, will revert to the Mexican
government. All other property not covered by the concession,
including movable railroad property we purchased from the
Mexican government, as well as all locomotives and railcars we
otherwise acquired, will remain our property. However, if we
attempt to sell more than 15.0% of our equipment to a third
party within 90 days of termination or revocation of our
concession, the Mexican government will have a right of first
refusal to purchase the equipment on the same terms offered by
the third party if no other concessionaire is likely to provide
rail services over our rail lines and the equipment being sold
is indispensable to the continuation of our rail services. After
the Mexican government receives notice from us of our intention
to sell the equipment, it will have 30 days to exercise its
right of first refusal. In addition, the Mexican government will
have the right to cause us to lease all of our service-related
assets to the Ministry of Transportation for a term of at least
one year, automatically renewable for additional one-year terms
up to five years. The Mexican government must exercise this
right within four months after revocation of the concession.

If the Mexican government legally terminates the concession,
public domain assets used in the operation of our rail lines
would be owned, controlled and managed by the Mexican
government. The



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Mexican government may also temporarily seize our rail lines and
our assets used in operating our rail lines in the event of a
natural disaster, war, significant public disturbances, or
imminent danger to the domestic peace or economy. In such
events, the Ministry of Transportation may restrict our ability
to exploit the concession fully for such time and in such manner
as the Ministry of Transportation deems necessary under the
circumstances but only for the duration of any of the foregoing
events. Further, Mexican law requires that the Mexican
government pay us compensation if it effects a statutory
appropriation for reasons of the public interest. With respect
to a temporary seizure due to any cause other than international
war, the Mexican railroad services law and regulations provides
that the Mexican government will indemnify an affected
concessionaire for an amount equal to damages caused and losses
suffered. These payments may not be sufficient to compensate us
for our losses and may not be timely made.

Employees and Labor Relations.

Labor relations in the
U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive
governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
(“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
renegotiated when they become open for modification, but their
terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached.
Typically, neither management nor labor employees are permitted
to take economic action until extended procedures are exhausted.
Approximately 82% of KCSR’s employees are covered under
various collective bargaining agreements with different labor
organizations. Under the negotiating process for new collective
bargaining agreements which began on November 1, 1999, all
unions reached new labor agreements with KCSR in 2005. Wages,
health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have
been negotiated on an industry-wide scale. Previously, these
negotiations, which can take place over significant periods of
time, have not resulted in any extended work interruptions. The
existing agreements will remain in effect until new agreements
are reached or the RLA’s procedures are exhausted. Until
new agreements are reached, the current agreements provide for
periodic wage adjustments.

Approximately 71% of KCSM’s total employees are covered by
a labor agreement, which was renewed in 2005 and is effective
for a two-year term ending in July 2007. The compensation terms
of the labor agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual
basis and all other terms are renegotiated every two years.
These negotiations have not resulted in any strikes, boycotts or
other material disruptions at KCSM.

Note 2.

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements are presented using the
accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
influence, but not more than 50% voting interest; the cost
method of accounting is generally used for investments of less
than 20% voting interest. The Surface Transportation
Board’s approval of KCS’s application for control of
the Texas Mexican Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”) was
effective December 29, 2004. KCS obtained control of
Mexrail on January 1, 2005. Accordingly, for the year ended
December 31, 2005 the Company has consolidated the
financial results of Mexrail. KCS completed the purchase of the
controlling interest in Grupo TFM on April 1, 2005.
Beginning April 1, 2005, the financial results of Grupo TFM
have been consolidated into KCS. Prior to the effective date of
the acquisition of control on January 1, 2005 for Mexrail
and April 1, 2005 for Grupo TFM, the investments were
accounted for under the equity method.

KCSM Seniority premiums.

KCSM employees are entitled to a
seniority premium upon termination of employment after
15 years of service. Seniority premiums are expensed in the
years in which the services are rendered. Other compensation
based on length of service to which employees may be entitled



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the event of dismissal, in accordance with the Mexican
Federal Law, is charged to expense in the year in which it
becomes payable.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial reporting
policies of the Company conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. of America
(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Management reviews its estimates, including
those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets,
as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental
remediation, casualty claims, and income taxes. Changes in facts
and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes freight
revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a commodity
movement. Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the
product is shipped, as services are performed or contractual
obligations fulfilled.

Cash Equivalents.

Short-term liquid investments with an
initial maturity of generally three months or less are
considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at
December 31, 2004 also included a $10 million deposit
in connection with the litigation under the Original Acquisition
Agreement which was refunded on completion of the Acquisition.

Restricted Cash.

In connection with KCS’s
acquisition of the controlling interest in Grupo TFM (the
“Acquisition”), KCS entered into a consulting
agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with José
F. Serrano International Business, S.A. de C.V.
(“JSIB”), a consulting company controlled by José
F. Serrano Segovia, Chairman of the Board of TMM, which
agreement became effective upon the closing of the Acquisition.
Under this agreement, JSIB will provide consulting services to
KCS in connection with the portion of the business of KCS in
Mexico for a period of three years. As consideration for these
services, subject to the terms and conditions of the Consulting
Agreement, JSIB receives an annual fee of $3.0 million. The
Consulting Agreement required KCS to deposit the total amount of
annual fees payable under the Consulting Agreement
($9.0 million) in cash to be held and released in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Consulting
Agreement and the applicable escrow agreement. JSIB directs the
investment of the escrow fund and all gains and losses accrue in
the fund to the benefit of JSIB. Such amounts are payable
concurrent with the payment of the annual fee.

As of December 31, 2004, in connection with the
Acquisition, $200 million was held in an escrow account.
Such amounts were restricted for the purpose of that transaction
and could only be released to the Company if the transaction was
terminated. The funds were distributed at closing of the
transaction on April 1, 2005.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable, net
includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for
uncollectible accounts as determined based on historical
experience and may be adjusted for economic uncertainties or
known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance for bad
debts when a customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has
been transferred to a collection agent or submitted for legal
action and in certain other cases, when a customer is
significantly past due and all available means of collection
have been exhausted.

Inventories.

Inventories, primarily diesel fuel, items to
be used in the maintenance of rolling stock and items to be used
in the maintenance or construction of road property, are valued
at the lower of average cost or market.

Mexican Peso to U.S. Dollar Translation.

For tax
purposes, Grupo TFM and its subsidiaries are required to
maintain their books and records in Mexican pesos
(“Ps”). For financial reporting purposes,



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Grupo TFM and subsidiaries keep records and use the
U.S. dollar as their functional and reporting currency. The
U.S. dollar is the currency that reflects the economic
substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to
the entity (i.e., historical cost convention).

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican pesos are
translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates.
The difference between the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction and the exchange rate on the settlement date, or
balance sheet date if not settled, is included in the income
statement as other income.

Liabilities related to the KCSM Acquisition.

In
connection with the acquisition of Grupo TFM and the settlement
of the VAT/ Put, the Company has recorded certain liabilities
payable to TMM, as summarized below.

•

The $47.0 million Escrow Notes (see description of the
    “Escrow Notes” in Note 3) are subject to
    reduction for certain potential losses related to breaches of
    certain representations, warranties, or covenants in the
    Acquisition Agreement or claims relating thereto, or under other
    conditions. The $47.0 amount is payable on or before
    April 1, 2007 and accrues interest at a stated rate of
    5.0%. The $47.0 million and related interest, is payable in
    cash or in stock (shares to be determined based on the volume
    weighted average price (the “VWAP”) 20 days prior
    to the settlement) at the Company’s discretion.
    Accordingly, as of December 31, 2005, the Company has
    included $48.8 million for this liability and the related
    accrued interest in other noncurrent liabilities on the balance
    sheet.

•

A contingent payment of $110.0 million payable to TMM as a
    result of the final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put
    (described in Note 3) which will be settled in three parts:
    (i) $35.0 million in stock (shares to be determined
    based on the VWAP 20 days prior to the final resolution of
    the VAT Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement);
    (ii) $35.0 million in cash upon final resolution of
    the VAT Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement;
    and (iii) up to an additional $40.0 million in cash or
    stock (shares to be determined based on the VWAP in accordance
    with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement) payable no more
    than five years from the final closing date. The liability is
    non-interest bearing; therefore, it has been recorded at its
    present value based on a 5.0% discount rate, consistent with the
    stated rate of similar interest bearing notes in the Acquisition
    Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005 the Company
    has recorded as a current liability of $69.3 million to be
    settled upon final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put, as
    defined in the Acquisition Agreement, and $31.6 million as
    a non-current liability to be settled in 5 years.

•

A contingent payment of $9.0 million payable to JSIB, which
    became payable upon final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put.
    The $9.0 million is payable in cash or in stock (shares to
    be determined based on the VWAP 20 days prior to the final
    resolution of the VAT Claim and Put) at the Company’s
    discretion. Accordingly, at December 31, 2005 the Company
    has recorded the $9.0 million as a current liability to be
    settled upon final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put, as
    defined in the Acquisition Agreement.

On March 13, 2006, in settlement of the $110.0 million
obligation to TMM, KCS paid $35 million in cash, issued
1,494,469 shares of KCS Common Stock at the VWAP price of
$23.4197, as determined in connection with the Acquisition
Agreement, and issued a $40 million, five year note. Also
on March 13, 2006, in settlement of the $9.0 million
obligation to JSIB, KCS paid $9.0 million to JSIB.

Payable to Related Parties.

As of December 31, 2004,
substantially all of the Payable to related parties relates to
the acquisition of Grupo TFM’s interest in Mexrail under
the terms of the Mexrail Stock Purchase Agreement. Under the
terms of that agreement, KCS had an option to purchase the
remaining shares of Mexrail owned by KCSM at a price of
$31.4 million. Among other conditions, the agreement



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provided that if KCS did not exercise the purchase option, or
otherwise acquire direct or indirect ownership of the remaining
49% interest, KCS would be obligated to purchase KCSM’s 49%
interest in Mexrail on October 31, 2005 (the “KCSM
Put”). With the completion of the acquisition of Grupo TFM,
the Company acquired indirect ownership of KCSM’s remaining
49% interest in Mexrail, which effectively extinguished the KCSM
Put. At December 31, 2005, the results of Grupo TFM and
Mexrail are presented on a consolidated basis.

Properties, Concession Assets and Depreciation.

Properties are stated at cost. Additions and renewals, including
those on leased assets that increase the life or utility of the
asset are capitalized and all properties are depreciated over
the estimated remaining life or lease term of such assets,
whichever is shorter. The Company capitalizes certain overhead
costs representing the indirect costs associated with
construction and improvement projects. Overhead factors are
periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs.
Depreciation for railway operating assets is derived using the
group-life method. This method classifies similar assets by
equipment or road type and depreciates these assets as a whole.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.

As further described in “Note 3 —
Investments and Acquisitions”, during the current year the
Company completed the acquisitions Mexrail and Grupo TFM. In
conjunction with these acquisitions and as a result of the
allocation of the purchase price, adjustments have been made to
the carrying value of both the owned properties owned and the
Concession rights and related assets. The fair values assigned
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on
valuations prepared by independent third party appraisal firms,
published market prices and management estimates.

Concession assets acquired and liabilities assumed pursuant to
the Asset Purchase Agreement, dated December 1996, entered into
among FNE (now known as KCSM), the Secretary of Communications
and the Mexican National Railway, include:

KCSR Depreciation Study.

For the year ended
December 31, 2004, changes were made to certain KCSR
depreciation rates. As described above, depreciation is computed
using group straight-line rates for financial statement
purposes, which require approval of the STB. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the KCSR engaged a civil
engineering firm with expertise in railway property usage to
conduct a study to evaluate depreciation rates for properties
and equipment. The study centered on evaluating actual
historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
indicated that KCSR was depreciating its property over shorter
periods than we actually utilize the assets, as estimated by the
study. Specifically, the average rate applied to the Road and
Structures Asset class (primarily rail, railroad ties and
bridges) decreased approximately 0.7%, while the average rate
applied to the Rolling Stock and Equipment Asset class
(locomotives and railcars) decreased approximately 0.6%. The
effect of this change in estimate on net income was
approximately $8.0 million, net of tax of $5.0 million
($0.12 per share, on a diluted basis), for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the group depreciation
method for consistency with KCSR. Accordingly, changes were made
to certain historical depreciation rates. Unlike KCSR, KCSM
depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the STB,



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accordingly, the changes to the depreciation rates were applied
in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the KCSM
engaged a civil engineering firm with expertise in railway
property usage to conduct an analysis of depreciation rates for
properties and equipment. The analysis centered on evaluating
actual historical replacement patterns to assess future lives
and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its property over
shorter periods than we actually utilize the assets. As a
result, depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of
2005 reflected an adjustment totaling $5.5 million, to
reduce relating to depreciation expense as recorded in the
second and third quarters of 2005. Concession rights and related
assets are amortized over the shorter of their remaining useful
life as determined by the KCSM depreciation review or the life
of the concession.

The ranges of annual depreciation rates for financial statement
purposes are:

Road and structures

2%-14%

Rolling stock and equipment

2%-22%

Computer software

8%-14%

Capitalized leases

3%- 7%

Accelerated depreciation is used for income tax purposes.

The cost of transportation equipment and road property normally
retired, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated
depreciation. The cost of industrial and other property retired,
and the cost of transportation property abnormally retired,
together with accumulated depreciation thereon, are eliminated
from the property accounts and the related gains or losses are
reflected in net income. Gains or losses recognized on the sale
of non-operating property reflected in other income are not
material for the periods presented.

Concession rights and related assets.

Costs incurred by
the Company to acquire the concession rights and related assets
were capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets and rights acquired. Concession
replacements and improvements are stated at cost. Major repairs
and track rehabilitation are capitalized. Amortization is
calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful lives of the respective improvements or, the term of the
concession, if shorter.

Long-lived assets.

The Company evaluates the
recoverability of its operating properties when there is an
indication that an asset value has been impaired. The
measurement of possible impairment is based primarily on the
ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from expected
future operating cash flows related to the assets on an
undiscounted basis. At December 31, 2005, there were no
assets which required an impairment adjustment.

Casualty Claims.

Casualty claims in excess of
self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
The Company’s casualty liability reserve is based on a
study by an independent third party actuarial firm performed on
an undiscounted basis. The reserve is based on claims filed and
an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While the
ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims.
Adjustments to the liability will be reflected as operating
expenses in the period in which the adjustments are known. Legal
fees related to casualty claims are recorded in operating
expense in the period in which they are incurred.

As more fully described in Note 9 “Commitments and
Contingencies” reserves for occupational illness claims
were previously established through an assessment made on a
case-by-case basis, and a liability was established when
management determined that it was probable and reasonably
estimable. Prior to 2005, no provision was made for occupational
illness claims that may have been incurred but not yet reported,
since the Company believed the low end of the range of
reasonably possible loss was not material. During 2005 the
company experienced a marked increase in the number of such
claims,



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accordingly the Company requested and obtained an actuarial
study of these potential unasserted claims for the first time.
The study indicated that existing reserves should be increased
by $7.5 million.

Computer Software Costs.

Costs incurred in conjunction
with the purchase or development of computer software for
internal use are capitalized. Costs incurred in the preliminary
project stage, as well as training and maintenance costs, are
expensed as incurred. Direct and indirect costs associated with
the application development stage of internal use software are
capitalized until such time that the software is substantially
complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the
software.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The Company’s
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, lease and contract receivables, accounts
payable and long-term debt as described in Note 5.

The financial statement carrying value of the Company’s
cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term
nature. Carrying value approximates fair value for all financial
instruments with six months or less to re-pricing or maturity
and for financial instruments with variable interest rates. The
Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt based upon
borrowing rates available at the reporting date for indebtedness
with similar terms and average maturities. Based upon the
borrowing rates currently available to the Company and its
subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was approximately
$1,938.6 million and $704 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The financial statement carrying
value was $1,860.6 million and $665 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Derivative Instruments.

Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), as
amended, requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance
sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded either
through current earnings or as other comprehensive income,
depending on the type of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on
the derivative instrument reported in other comprehensive income
are reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings
are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged
item. The ineffective portion of all hedge transactions is
recognized in current period earnings.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of transactions
reported in different periods for financial reporting and income
tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. This method gives consideration to
the future tax consequences of the deferred income tax items and
immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo TFM
on April  1, 2005, Grupo TFM provided deferred income
taxes for the difference between the financial reporting and
income tax bases of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its
proportionate share of these income taxes through its equity in
Grupo TFM’s earnings. Since April 1, 2005, Grupo TFM
income taxes are reflected in the consolidated results. Although
KCSM has generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due
primarily to the accelerated tax amortization of the concession
rights. We have recognized a deferred income tax asset for the
resulting net operating loss carryforwards and may continue to
recognize additional amounts in the next few years. Management
anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
realized given the long carryforward period (through the year
2046) for amortization of the concession, as well as the fact
that we expect to generate taxable income in the future. Our tax
projections take into consideration certain assumptions, some of
which are under our control and others which are not. Key
assumptions include inflation rates, currency fluctuations and
future revenue growth. If our assumptions are not correct, we
would have to recognize a valuation allowance on our deferred
tax asset.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Prior to 2005, the Company did not provide U.S. Federal
income taxes for the temporary difference between the financial
reporting basis and income tax basis of its investment in Grupo
TFM because Grupo TFM was a foreign corporate joint venture
that was considered permanent in duration, and the Company did
not expect the reversal of the temporary difference to occur in
the foreseeable future. Following the acquisition of control of
Grupo TFM in 2005, the Company has not provided
U.S. Federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
Grupo TFM since the Company intends to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely outside of the United States.

KCSM employees’ statutory profit sharing.

KCSM is
subject to employee statutory profit sharing requirements under
Mexican law and calculates profit sharing liability as 10% of
KCSM net taxable income, adjusted as prescribed by the Mexican
Income Tax law. In calculating its net taxable income for
statutory profit sharing purposes, KCSM previously deducted NOL
carryforwards. The application of NOL carryforwards can result
in a deferred profit sharing asset for a given period instead of
a profit sharing liability. The Mexican tax authorities had
challenged KCSM’s calculation of statutory profit sharing
liabilities in the late 1990s, but KCSM prevailed with a Mexican
Fiscal Court ruling in 1999 followed by a Tax Authority Release
acknowledging its ability to continue to calculate statutory
profit sharing the way it had been, including the deduction of
NOL carryforwards in the calculation of net taxable income
for statutory profit sharing purposes. However, since a
technical amendment to the Mexican tax law in 2002, the Mexican
tax authorities have objected to KCSM’s deduction of NOL
carryforwards in the calculation of net taxable income for
statutory profit sharing purposes following such amendment,
which objection KCSM has challenged in court. Under
U.S. GAAP, employee statutory profit sharing is an
operating expense.

Due to a series of decisions in 2005 by the Mexican Supreme
Court declaring that NOLs from previous years may not be
deducted, KCSM changed the method of calculating its statutory
profit sharing liability. KCSM no longer deducts NOLs from prior
years when calculating employee statutory profit sharing. This
change required KCSM to write off its deferred tax assets
related to statutory profit sharing resulting in a charge to
operating expenses of $35.6 million, after purchase
accounting adjustments.

Changes of Interest in Subsidiaries and Equity Investees.

A change of the Company’s interest in a subsidiary or
equity investee resulting from the sale of the subsidiary’s
or equity investee’s stock is generally recorded as a gain
or loss in the Company’s net income in the period that the
change of interest occurs. If an issuance of stock by the
subsidiary or affiliate is from treasury shares on which gains
have been previously recognized, however, KCS will record the
gain directly to its equity and not include the gain in net
income. A change of interest in a subsidiary or equity investee
resulting from a subsidiary’s or equity investee’s
purchase of its stock increases the Company’s ownership
percentage of the subsidiary or equity investee. The Company
records this type of transaction under the purchase method of
accounting, whereby any excess of fair market value over the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as
goodwill.

Treasury Stock.

The excess of par over cost of the
preferred shares held in Treasury is credited to paid in
capital. Common shares held in Treasury are accounted for as if
they were retired and the excess of cost over par value of such
shares is charged to paid in capital.

Stock Plans.

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options or subscriptions are credited to the appropriate
stockholders’ equity accounts in the year exercised.

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”), compensation expense is recognized
ratably over the option vesting period to the extent that an
option exercise price is less than the market price of the stock
at the date of grant. KCS’s practice is to set the option
exercise price equal to the market price of the stock at date of
grant; therefore, no compensation expense is recognized for
financial reporting purposes.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“SFAS 123”) in October 1995. This statement
allows companies to continue under the approach set forth in
APB 25 for recognizing stock-based compensation expense in
the financial statements, but encourages companies to adopt the
fair value method of accounting for employee stock options.
Under SFAS 123, companies must either record compensation
expense based on the estimated grant date fair value of stock
options granted or disclose the impact on net income as if they
had adopted the fair value method (for grants subsequent to
December 31, 1994). If KCS had measured compensation cost
for the KCS stock options granted to its employees and shares
subscribed by its employees under the KCS employee stock
purchase plan, under the fair value based method prescribed by
SFAS 123 (see additional information regarding
SFAS 123R under “New Accounting Pronouncements”),
net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

All shares held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(“ESOP”) are treated as outstanding for purposes of
computing the Company’s earnings per share. See additional
information in “Note 8 — Profit Sharing and
Other Postretirement Benefits.”

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per common share is
computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Restricted shares granted to employees and officers are
included in weighted average shares for purposes of computing
basic earnings per common share as they are earned. Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if convertible securities were converted into common stock
or stock options were exercised. The following is a
reconciliation from the weighted average shares used for the
basic earnings per share computation to the shares used for the
diluted earnings per share computation for each of the years

and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future

New Accounting Pronouncements.

SFAS 123R

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised), “Share-Based
Payments” (“SFAS 123R”), which is effective
in the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005.
Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to measure
the cost of employee service received in exchange for awards of
stock options based upon the fair value of the options as of
their grant date. The cost of the employee service will be
recognized as compensation cost ratably over the option vesting
period. Previously, the Company recognized compensation expense
to the extent that an option price was less than the market
price of the stock at the date of the grant (the “Intrinsic
Value”). Because KCS’s practice was to set the option
exercise price equal to the market price of the stock as of the
date of the grant, no compensation expense was recognized for
financial reporting purposes. SFAS 123R allows the use of
either the Black-Scholes or a lattice option-pricing model to
calculate the fair value of options. The Company intends to use
the Modified Prospective Application, which would require that
all new awards and modified awards after the effective date and
any unvested awards at the effective date can be recognized as
compensation cost ratably over the option vesting period.

As described above under “Stock Plans,” using the
Black-Scholes method, the after-tax expense related to share
based compensation would have been $0.8 million,
$1.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively. The impact on future
operating results will be dependent on the type and extent of
stock-based compensation to be issued as determined by the
Company’s Compensation Committee and cannot be determined
at this time.

SFAS 143

KCS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (“SFAS 143”) effective for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Under SFAS 143, the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation must be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of the fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset. KCSR, along with other Class I
railroads, depreciates track structure (rail, ties, and other
track material) in accordance with regulations promulgated by
the STB. These regulations require KCSR to depreciate track
structure to a net salvage value (gross estimated salvage value
less estimated costs to remove the track structure at the end of
its useful life). For certain track structure such as ties, with
little or no gross salvage value, this practice ultimately
results in depreciating an asset below a value of zero, and
thus, in effect, results in recording a liability. Under the
requirements of SFAS 143, in the absence of a legal
obligation to remove the track structure, such accounting
practice is prohibited. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 143 in the first quarter of 2003, and, as a result,
reviewed its depreciation of track structures to determine
instances where the depreciation of removal costs has resulted
or would be expected (based on the current depreciation rate) to
result in the depreciation of an asset below zero when
considering net



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

salvage value. As a result of this review, the Company estimated
the excess depreciation recorded on such assets and recorded
this amount as a reduction in accumulated depreciation of
$14.5 million and as a cumulative effect of an accounting
change of $8.9 million (net of taxes of $5.6 million)
as required by SFAS 143 in the first quarter of 2003.

A summary of the pro forma net income and earnings per share had
SFAS 143 been applied retroactively is as follows:

FIN 46 (revised)

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”). The Company
adopted FIN 46R effective for the year ended
December 31, 2003. FIN 46R clarifies the application
of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain
variable interest entities by providing guidance on how a
business entity should evaluate whether it has controlling
financial interest in an entity through means other than voting
rights and how the entity should be consolidated. FIN 46R
replaces Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” which was issued in January
2003. The Company performed an assessment of its equity method
investments in Southern Capital and PCRC for any potential
impact this interpretation may have on its accounting for these
entities as equity investments. The adoption of FIN 46R had
no material impact on the Company’s accounting for its
investment in Southern Capital or PCRC since, at inception,
these entities had sufficient funding and capital.

ACQUISITIONS.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, “Business Combinations”, the Company
allocated the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible
and intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity
based on their fair values. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value was recorded as goodwill. The fair values
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based
on valuations prepared by independent third party appraisal
firms, published market prices and management estimates. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. An
impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the
carrying amount exceeds the assets’ fair value. Intangible
assets with estimable useful lives are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.

Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Grupo TFM.

April 1, 2005 — Acquisition Agreement.

In
furtherance of the Company’s strategy for expansion into
Mexico, on December 15, 2004, the Company entered into the
Amended and Restated Acquisition Agreement (the
“Acquisition Agreement”) with TMM and other parties
under which KCS would acquire control of KCSM through the
purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo TFM. At the time,
Grupo TFM held an 80% interest in KCSM and all of the
shares of stock with full voting rights of KCSM. The remaining
20% economic interest in KCSM was owned by the Mexican
government in the form of shares with limited voting rights.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS acquired all
of TMM’s 48.5% effective interest in Grupo TFM on
April 1, 2005 in exchange for $200.0 million in cash,
18 million shares of KCS common stock, and two-year
promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $47.0 million
(the “Escrow Notes”), as well as $27.5 million in
transaction costs for a total purchase price of
$594.4 million. The $47.0 million Escrow Notes are
subject to reduction pursuant to the indemnification provisions
of the Acquisition Agreement for certain potential losses
related to breaches of certain representations, warranties, or
covenants in the Acquisition Agreement or claims relating
thereto, or under other conditions specified in the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement.

In exchange for the purchase price of $594.4 million, KCS
acquired 48.5% of Grupo TFM (or 38.8% of KCSM). On a preliminary
basis, the excess of purchase price over the historical book
value of the assets resulted in a net increase in the basis of
the assets of approximately $199.6 million. As a result of
the ongoing valuation of certain assets and liabilities, during
the fourth quarter of 2005, Grupo TFM and KCSM, recognized
changes to the preliminary allocation of purchase price, which
was pushed down by KCS. In addition, the KCS purchase price was
increased by $4.4 million, relating primarily to an
increase in the estimates for severance and relocation costs.

In connection with the evaluation of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities of Grupo TFM, certain assets were
identified as having little or no value to KCS as the acquiring
company. Because KCS acquired only 48.5% of Grupo TFM (or 38.8%
of KCSM) in this transaction, the allocation of the excess
purchase price over book value of net assets was limited to the
acquired percentage. Accordingly, a reduction in the assets of
Grupo TFM was limited to acquired percentage and any residual
was charged to expense. Grupo TFM operating expenses include
$39.5 million relating to decreases in the basis of certain
assets, the most significant of which was the write off of
deferred employee profit sharing asset of approximately
$35.6 million as a result of recent legal rulings in Mexico.

September 12, 2005 Completion of VAT/ Put
Settlement.

On September 12, 2005, the Company and its
subsidiaries, KCSM and Grupo TFM, along with TMM, entered into a
settlement agreement with the Mexican government, resolving the
controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

government concerning the payment of a value added tax
(“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the obligation
(“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of KCSM owned
by the Mexican government (the “VAT/ Put Settlement”).
As a result of the VAT/ Put Settlement, KCS and its subsidiaries
now own 100% of Grupo TFM and KCSM; the potential
obligation of KCS, Grupo TFM and TMM to acquire the Mexican
government’s remaining 20% ownership of KCSM has been
eliminated; and the legal obligation of the Mexican government
to issue the VAT refund to KCSM has been satisfied. There was no
cash exchanged between the parties to the settlement agreement.
In addition, the parties entered into mutual releases of all
existing and potential claims relating to the VAT refund and the
Put obligation, and entered into an agreement to dismiss all of
the existing litigation between the parties.

The VAT/ Put Settlement had two separate impacts —
first, the resolution of a preacquisition contingency related to
the April 1, 2005 transaction and second, KCSM’s
acquisition of the minority interest held by the Mexican
government.

Resolution of pre-acquisition contingencies.

Both the VAT refund claim and the Mexican government’s put
rights were pre-acquisition contingencies. Accordingly, the
impact of the acquired asset and the resulting liability has
been reflected as adjustments to the preliminary purchase
accounting described above. Because there is no market for Grupo
TFM stock, management assessed the fair value of the
government’s shares acquired in the settlement to be
properly estimated as the pro rata equivalent of the fair value
of Grupo TFM stock paid to TMM under the Acquisition Agreement.
Based on this assessment, the fair value of the Mexican
government’s shares was determined to be
$305.5 million.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS acquired
TMM’s 51% interest in the VAT refund claim as settled.
Accordingly, the preliminary purchase accounting for the Grupo
TFM acquisition has been adjusted to reflect as an asset the
fair value of the acquisition of TMM’s proportionate share
of the VAT refund claim of $155.8 million.

In accordance with the Acquisition Agreement, a contingent
payment of additional purchase price of $110.0 million
became payable to TMM as a result of the final resolution of the
VAT Claim and Put, which will be settled in three parts:
(i) $35.0 million in stock (shares to be determined
based on the VWAP 20 days prior to the final resolution of
the VAT Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement);
(ii) $35.0 million in cash at time of final resolution
of the VAT Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement; and (iii) up to an additional $40.0 million
in cash or stock (shares to be determined in accordance with the
provisions of the Acquisition Agreement) payable no more than
five years from the final closing date (April  1,
2005). The liability is non-interest bearing, therefore it has
been recorded at its present value based on a 5.0% discount
rate, consistent with the stated rate of similar interest
bearing notes in the Acquisition Agreement.

The remaining fair value of the Mexican government’s shares
obtained in the VAT/ Put Settlement, approximately
$149.7 million, is attributable to the previously existing
49% KCS interest in Grupo TFM and has been recorded as
nonoperating income and is presented net of applicable legal,
consulting and other fees of approximately $17.8 million
including, $9.0 million payable to JSIB, which became
payable on final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put. The VAT/
Put settlement gain was not taxable in Mexico. The Company
believes, based upon opinions of outside legal counsel and other
factors, that the VAT/ Put Settlement should not be taxable to
KCS for U.S. income tax purposes. Such position has not
been examined by the taxing authority and it is possible that
this position could be challenged. The amount of such tax would
be material; however the Company believes that it would have the
right to indemnification under the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement.

KCSM Acquisition of Mexican government Shares.

In connection with the VAT/ Put Settlement, the acquisition of
the Mexican government’s interest was accounted for as a
purchase. The aggregate carrying value of $375.6 million
for the Mexican government shares (23.9% effective
ownership — consisting of minority interest of
$256.9 million and the Association in Participation
Agreement with a book value of $118.7 million) exceeded the
estimated fair value of this interest of $305.5 million
representing the purchase price.

Purchase Price Allocation

Significant components of the allocation of the excess of the
purchase price over the carrying value of the net assets
acquired, including both the April 1, 2005 and the
September 12, 2005 acquisitions, are as follows:

The allocation of the purchase price above reflects preliminary
estimates to various amounts that are subject to change as the
Company obtains additional information relating to the fair
values of certain property and equipment. The preliminary
purchase price allocation reflects $15.3 million relating
to estimated severance and relocation costs. During the nine
months ended December 31, 2005 the Company has expended
$5.4 million, with $9.9 million left to disburse.

In addition, the existing excess in the carrying value of the
Company’s investment over the book value of Grupo TFM
($13.7 million) was recorded as an addition to property,
plant and equipment, and concession assets.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of
acquisition as adjusted for the above impacts (dollars in
millions):

Deferred Assets and Liabilities.

In connection with the Acquisition, we assessed the fair value
of KCSM’s long term contractual relationships including,
debt, locomotive and railcar leases and maintenance contracts
for locomotives. As a result of the amortization of the deferred
credits and deferred charges, for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005 KCSM recognized an increase in equipment
costs of $5.6 million and reductions of purchased services
expense and interest costs of $4.8 million and
$2.3 million, respectively. Fair value was determined based
on current market rates and other management estimates.
Accordingly, we have recorded necessary valuation reserves for
the related contracts which are reflected in the
December 31, 2005 consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition of Mexrail.

On August 16, 2004, KCS, TMM and KCSM entered into a new
Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of that
agreement, KCS purchased from KCSM 51% of the outstanding shares
of Mexrail, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KCSM, for
$32.7 million and placed those shares into trust pending
approval of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”)
to exercise common control over KCSR, the Gateway Eastern
Railway Company (“Gateway Eastern”) and Tex-Mex. On
November 29, 2004, the STB approved the Company’s
application for authority to control KCSR, Gateway Eastern and
Tex-Mex. The shares representing 51% ownership of Mexrail were
transferred by the trustee to KCS, and KCS assumed control, on
January 1, 2005.

The aggregate purchase price was $57.4 million including
$32.7 million of cash with the remaining amount consisting
of net receivables and payables with Mexrail and Grupo TFM. The
acquisition of Mexrail links KCSR physically to KCSM. The
Company’s management completed a preliminary evaluation of
the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Mexrail in the
first quarter of 2005.

SOUTHERN CAPITAL CORPORATION, LLC

In 1996, the Company and GATX Capital Corporation
(“GATX”) completed a transaction for the formation and
financing of a joint venture, Southern Capital Corporation, LLC
(“Southern Capital”), to perform certain leasing and
financing activities. Southern Capital’s principal
operations are the acquisition of locomotives, rolling stock and
other railroad equipment and the leasing thereof to KCSR. The
Company holds a 50% interest in Southern Capital, which it
accounts for using the equity method of accounting.

Concurrent with the formation of this joint venture, the KCSR
entered into operating leases with Southern Capital for
substantially all the locomotives and rolling stock contributed
or sold to Southern Capital at rental rates that management
believes reflected market conditions at that time. Southern
Capital has acquired additional equipment since its inception,
all of which is leased to KCSR. KCSR paid Southern Capital
$30.1 million, $32.5 million and $35.3 million
under these operating leases in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In connection with the formation of Southern
Capital, the Company received cash that exceeded the net book
value of assets contributed to the joint venture by
approximately $44.1 million. Accordingly, this excess fair
value over book value is being recognized as a reduction in
lease rental expense over the terms of the leases (approximately
$3.6 million, $4.4 million and $4.5 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively). During 2005 and 2004, the
Company received cash dividends of $8.3 million and
$8.8 million respectively from Southern Capital. No
dividends were received from Southern Capital during 2003.

During 2005 and 2004, Southern Capital recorded a gain of
approximately $7.7 and $6.0 million, respectively related
to the sale of locomotives to KCSR. For purposes of recording
its share of Southern Capital earnings, the Company has recorded
its share of the gain as a reduction to the cost basis of the
equipment acquired. As a result, the Company will recognize its
equity in the gain over the remaining depreciable life of the
locomotives as a reduction of depreciation expense.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2001, Southern Capital refinanced its five-year credit
facility, which was scheduled to mature on October 19,
2001, with a one-year bridge loan for $201 million. On
June 25, 2002, Southern Capital refinanced the outstanding
balance of this bridge loan through the issuance of
approximately $167.6 million of 5.7% pass through trust
certificates and proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. Of
this amount, $104.0 million is secured by all of the
locomotives and rolling stock owned by Southern Capital (other
than the 50 locomotives, which were sold, as discussed below)
and rental payments payable by KCSR under the operating and
financing leases of the equipment owned by Southern Capital.
Payments of interest and principal of the pass through trust
certificates, which are due semi-annually on June 30 and
December 30 commencing on December 30, 2002 and ending
on June 30, 2022, are insured under a financial guarantee
insurance policy by MBIA Insurance Corporation
(“MBIA”). KCSR leases or subleases all of the
equipment securing the pass through certificates.

The remaining amount of pass through trust certificates,
approximately $63.6 million was assigned to General
Electric Corporation (“GE”), the buyer of the 50
locomotives, and is secured by the sold locomotives and rental
payments payable by KCSR under the sublease. Southern Capital
does not have the option, nor is it obligated to repurchase or
redeem the lease receivable or related equipment on or prior to
the expiration of the lease agreement entered into with KCSR at
the time of the sale. Southern Capital does not guarantee the
lease payments of KCSR and has no obligation to make such
payments if KCSR should fail to do so. In the event of a default
by KCSR, a third party insurance company, MBIA, guarantees the
outstanding debt and may seize the collateralized assets, or
find a third party lessee to continue making the rental payments
to satisfy the debt requirements.

PANAMA CANAL RAILWAY COMPANY

In January 1998, the Republic of Panama awarded PCRC, a joint
venture company owed equally by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc.,
the concession to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal
Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
international shippers with a railway transportation option to
complement the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal Railway, which
traces its origins back to the late 1800’s, is a
north-south railroad traversing the Panama isthmus between the
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The railroad has been reconstructed
and resumed freight operations on December  1, 2001.
Panarail operates and promotes commuter and tourist passenger
service over the Panama Canal Railway. Passenger service started
during July 2001.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has invested
approximately $30.4 million toward the reconstruction and
operations of the Panama Canal Railway. This investment is
comprised of $12.9 million of equity and $17.5 million
of subordinated loans. These loans carry a 10% interest rate and
are payable on demand, subject to certain restrictions.

In November 1999, PCRC completed the financing for the
reconstruction project with the International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”), a member of the World Bank Group.
The IFC’s investment of $5 million in PCRC is
comprised of non-voting preferred shares, which paid a 10%
cumulative dividend. On March  28, 2005, PCRC and the
IFC finalized an agreement whereby PCRC would redeem the shares
subscribed and owned by IFC pursuant to the IFC Subscription.
Under the agreement, PCRC paid to the IFC $10.5 million. At
December 31, 2004, these shares had a recorded value of
$5.0 million and approximately $2.6 million in accrued
unpaid dividends. PCRC recorded an additional cost of
approximately $2.9 million to reflect the premium paid to
IFC and, as a result, KCS recorded its share of this cost of
approximately $1.5 million in recording its equity in
earnings of PCRC in the first quarter of 2005.

Under the terms of the loan agreement with IFC, the Company is a
guarantor for up to $5.6 million of the associated debt.
Also if PCRC terminates the concession contract without
IFC’s consent, the Company is a guarantor for up to 50% of
the outstanding senior loans. The Company is also a guarantor
for up to $1.4 million of the equipment loans and
approximately $100,000 relating to the other capital



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

leases, and has issued an irrevocable letter of credit in the
amount of $1.5 million to fulfill the Company’s 50%
guarantee of a $2.9 million equipment loan. The cost of the
reconstruction totaled approximately $80 million.

THE MEXICO VALLEY RAILWAY AND TERMINAL (FERROCARRIL Y
TERMINAL DEL VALLE DE MÉXICO, S.A. DE C.V.
“FTVM”)

FTVM was incorporated as a sociedad anonima de capital variable
(variable capital corporation), under the laws of Mexico. The
Corporate purpose of the company is to provide railroad services
as well as ancillary services, including those related to
interconnection, switching and haulage services. KCSM holds
25.0% of the share capital of FTVM. The other shareholders of
FTVM, each holding a 25.0% interest, are Ferrocarril Mexicano,
S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”), Ferrocarril del Sureste,
S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”) and the Mexican Government.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM, is required to grant rights to
use portions of its track to Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM. The
Concession also stipulates that Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM are
required to grant KCSM the rights to use portions of their
tracks.

On March 27, 2002 KCSM purchased all of the shares of
Mexrail from TMM and KCS. Accordingly for the period from
January 1, 2004 through July 31, 2004, and for the
year ended December 31, 2003, the results of Mexrail are
consolidated into the results of Grupo TFM.

The effects of foreign currency transactions and capitalized
interest prior to June 23, 1997, which are not recorded on
Grupo TFM’s books, result in the difference between the
carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Grupo TFM
and the underlying equity in net assets. Additionally, the
purchase by Grupo TFM of the Mexican government’s former
24.6% interest in Grupo TFM resulted in a reduction of Grupo
TFM’s stockholder’s equity as the purchased shares
from the Mexican government were recorded as treasury shares at
Grupo TFM. The Company invested no funds in this transaction,
however, and, therefore, it did not have an impact on the
Company’s investment in Grupo TFM. As a result, the
difference between the Company’s equity in net assets of
Grupo TFM and its underlying investment arising as a result of
this transaction is being amortized against the Company’s
equity in earnings from Grupo TFM over a 33 year period,
which was the estimate of the average remaining useful life of
Grupo TFM’s concession assets.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The deferred income tax calculations for Grupo TFM are
significantly impacted by fluctuations in the relative value of
the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar and the rate of
Mexican inflation, and can result in significant variability in
the amount of equity earnings (losses) reported by the Company.

Sale-leaseback of locomotives.

In September 1999, KCSM
entered into a locomotive operating lease agreement covering 75
locomotives that was to expire in 20 years. The lease
agreement contained standard provisions for this type of
transaction, including the option to either purchase the assets
or return the assets to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
Because the lease agreement contained above market rates, in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

connection with the valuation of KCSM assets as part of the
Acquisition and the principles of push down accounting, KCSM
recorded a valuation reserve that was being amortized over the
remaining life of the lease.

On November 2, 2005, KCSR entered into an agreement with
El-Mo-Mex, Inc. (“El-Mo”) to acquire El-Mo’s
equity interest in the leased locomotives. KCSR and an affiliate
paid cash in the amount of approximately $32.6 million and
assumed approximately $95.9 million of debt and accrued
interest to acquire the locomotives. KCSR subsequently purchased
the locomotives from the affiliate. On December 20, 2005,
KCSR entered into a leveraged lease arrangement, treated for
financial reporting purposes as an operating lease, with an
unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to the terms of this
leveraged lease, KCSR was to sell the locomotives to a trust,
which would then lease the locomotives to KCSR for a period of
18 years. The trust also would assume the debt assumed by
KCSR in its purchase of the locomotives. Prior to year end, KCSR
had completed the sale of 54 of the locomotives to the trust.
The remaining 19 units (two of the original 75 were
determined to be damaged beyond repair) valued at
$32.5 million were sold to the trust in January 2006 and
are included in the December 31, 2005 financial statements
as property.

Overhead Capitalization.

KCS capitalizes certain overhead
costs representing the indirect costs associated with
construction and improvement projects. Overhead factors are
periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs. As
a result of revisions to rates used to capitalize indirect costs
during the quarter ended June 30, 2005, operating expenses
were reduced by approximately $1.8 million. Similarly, in
the fourth quarter, the overhead allocation was reviewed to
ensure that all appropriate current year cost was allocated
which resulted in a reduction of operating expenses of
approximately $3.0 million.

Concession Assets.

As discussed in Note 1, in
December 1996, the Mexican Government (the
“Government”) granted KCSM the Concession (the
“Concession”) to operate the northeast rail lines for
an initial period of fifty years, exclusive for thirty years,
renewable, subject to certain conditions, for a second period of
equal length. Under the terms of the Concession, the Company has
the right to use and is obligated to maintain the right of way,
track structure, buildings and related maintenance facilities to
the operational standards specified in the concession agreement
and to return the assets in that condition at the end of the
concession period.

Amended 2004 Senior Secured Credit Facility.

On
March 30, 2004, the Company entered into a credit agreement
(“Credit Agreement”) consisting of a $100 million
revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit
Facility”) maturing on March 30, 2007 and a
$150 million Term B loan facility (“Term
Loan Facility”) maturing on March 30, 2008. The
Term Loan Facility was fully funded on the closing



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

date and the proceeds were used to pay transaction costs and for
other general corporate purposes, including additional
investments in the Company’s Mexican affiliates. Up to
$25.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility is available
for letters of credit and up to $15 million is available
for swing line loans. The proceeds from borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital and
for general corporate purposes, including additional investments
in the Company’s Mexican affiliates. The letters of credit
may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the
Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the
Company’s domestic assets and are guaranteed by the
majority of its domestic subsidiaries.

The Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility
bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin or at an
alternative base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable
margin for the Term Loan Facility was 200 basis points
over LIBOR for LIBOR borrowings. The applicable margin for the
Revolving Credit Facility was set at 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings
for the first six months and thereafter is based on the
Company’s leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of the
Company’s total debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding
the undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and
certain other non-cash charges) for the prior twelve months).

The Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee to
the lenders on the average daily, unused amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility. Additionally, a fee equal to the applicable
margin for LIBOR priced borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be paid on any letter of credit issued under the
Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005, the
KSCR revolver had an available balance of approximately
$33.0 million and the KCSM revolver had an available
balance of approximately $4.0 million.

The Credit Agreement contains certain provisions, covenants and
restrictions customary for this type of debt and for borrowers
with a similar credit rating. These provisions include, among
others, restrictions on the Company’s ability and its
subsidiaries ability to 1) incur additional debt or liens;
2) enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
3) merge or consolidate with another entity; 4) sell
assets; 5) enter into certain transactions with affiliates;
6) make investments, loans, advances, guarantees or
acquisitions; 7) make certain restricted payments,
including dividends, or make certain payments on other
indebtedness; or 8) make capital expenditures in excess of
allowed amounts. In addition, the Company is required to comply
with certain financial ratios, including minimum interest
expense coverage and leverage ratios. The Credit Agreement also
contains certain customary events of default. These covenants,
along with other provisions, could restrict maximum utilization
of the Revolving Credit Facility.

On December 22, 2004, KCS, KCSR, and other KCS its
subsidiaries entered into an amendment and waiver of the Credit
Agreement. The Credit Agreement was amended to, among other
things, increase the Term Loan Facility by $100,000,000 and
decrease the borrowing spread by 25 basis points to
175 basis points for LIBOR borrowings. In addition, a
waiver was granted that would allow KCSR to make an additional
$55 million of capital expenditures during 2004 and 2005.

On September 30, 2005, KCS, KCSR, and other KCS
subsidiaries entered into a second amendment and waiver of the
Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement was amended to increase
the Revolving Credit Facility commitment by $25.0 million
to a total available line of credit of $125.0 million. The
borrowing spread on the Revolving Credit Facility was reduced by
50 basis points, while the borrowing spread on the Term
Loan Facility was reduced by 25 basis points (based on
certain financial statement attributes). Additionally, the
capital expenditure limit was eliminated and certain other
nonmaterial changes were made to the Credit Agreement as part of
the amendment.

On November 4, 2005, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a third amendment of the Credit Agreement. The
Credit Agreement was amended to modify the definition of
“EBITDA” in



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

order to exclude from the definition certain non-cash charges
not to exceed $35.7 million in the aggregate for the fiscal
quarter ending on September 30, 2005, with respect to an
increase in claim reserves.

On December 8, 2005, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a third waiver of the Credit Agreement. The
provisions of Section 5.02(g) of the Credit Agreement were
waived in order to permit KCS to use substantially all of the
net proceeds from the issuance of its 5.125% Cumulative
Convertible Series D Preferred Stock to repurchase shares
of its common stock.

On March 1, 2006 KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a fourth waiver of the 2004 Credit Agreement (the
“Fourth Waiver”). Under the terms of the Fourth
Waiver, which expires on April 30, 2006, the Lenders have
agreed to waive the requirement that KCS, as defined in the
Credit Agreement maintain a leverage ratio of not more than
5.00:1 for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, provided
that such ratio does not exceed 5.50:1.

On April 7, 2006, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
entered into a fifth waiver of the Credit Agreement (the
“Fifth Waiver”). Under the terms of the Fifth Waiver,
which expires on April 30, 2006, the Lenders have agreed to
waive the requirement of Section 5.03(b) that KCS furnish a
copy of its 2005 annual audited financial statements by
March 31, 2006 so long as KCS furnishes such audited
financial statements by April 30, 2006.

On March 17, 2006, KCSR entered into a commitment letter
(the “Commitment Letter”) with The Bank of Nova Scotia
(“Scotia”) under which Scotia has agreed to provide
KCSR with a $371.2 million, fully underwritten, new credit
agreement to refinance KCSR’s existing Credit Agreement.
The new credit agreement will consist of a $246.2 million
term loan facility and a $125 million revolving credit
facility and contain terms and conditions substantially similar
to the Credit Agreement, but will provide KCSR with additional
financial flexibility. The closing on the new credit agreement
is expected to occur before April 30, 2006. KCSR expects to
be in compliance with all of the covenants of the new credit
agreement, including the leverage ratio, throughout its term.

registered notes bear a fixed annual interest rate to be paid
semi-annually on April 1 and November 1 and are due on
October 1, 2008. These registered notes are general
unsecured obligations of KCSR, are guaranteed by the Company and
certain of its domestic subsidiaries, and contain certain
covenants and restrictions customary for this type of debt
instrument and for borrowers with similar credit ratings.

issued. KCSR received the requisite consents from a majority of
the holders of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
each series of notes.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Consent Solicitation Statement dated May 11, 2005 and as
thereafter amended, KCSR, KCS, the other note guarantors, and
the trustee under each of the indentures, respectively, signed
supplemental indentures with respect to each such series of
notes to permit KCS, Grupo TFM, and KCSM to effect a settlement
of certain disputes among KCSM, Grupo TFM, and the Mexican
government.

Equipment Trust and Capital Lease Indebtedness.

KCSR has
purchased certain locomotives and rolling stock under equipment
trust certificates and capitalized lease obligations.

On November 2, 2005, KCSR entered into an agreement with
El-Mo-Mex, Inc. (“El-Mo”) to acquire El-Mo’s
equity interest in certain leased locomotives. KCSR and an
affiliate paid cash in the amount of approximately
$32.6 million and assumed approximately $95.9 million
of debt and accrued interest to acquire the locomotives. KCSR
subsequently purchased the locomotives from the affiliate. On
December 20, 2005, KCSR entered into a leveraged lease
arrangement, treated for financial reporting purposes as an
operating lease, with an unaffiliated third party. Pursuant to
the terms of this leveraged lease, KCSR was to sell the
locomotives to a trust, which would then lease the locomotives
to KCSR for a period of 18 years. The trust also would
assume the debt assumed by KCSR in its purchase of the
locomotives. Prior to year end, KCSR had completed the sale of
54 of the locomotives to the trust. The remaining 19 units
(two of the original 75 were determined to be damaged beyond
repair) valued at $32.5 million were sold to the trust in
January 2006. As of December 31, 2005 there was
$24.3 million of debt associated with the 19 unsold
locomotives recorded on our balance sheet.

RRIF Loan Agreement.

On July 13, 2005, Tex-Mex
entered into an agreement with the Federal Railroad
Administration (“FRA”) with an effective date of
June 28, 2005 to borrow $50.0 million to be used for
infrastructure improvements. These improvements are expected to
increase efficiency and capacity in order to accommodate growing
freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA corridor. The interest
rate under the loan agreement is 4.29% and the principal balance
amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of July 13, 2030.
At December 31, 2005, Tex-Mex had borrowed
$21.7 million under the loan agreement. Tex-Mex expects to
draw down the remaining available principal balance during 2006.
The loan is being made under the Railroad Rehabilitation and
Improvement Financing (“RRIF”) Program administered by
the FRA. The loan is guaranteed by Mexrail, which has issued a
Pledge Agreement in favor of the lender equal to the gross
revenues earned by Mexrail on per-car fees charged for traffic
crossing the International Rail Bridge located in Laredo, Texas.

On April 1, 2005, KCSM commenced a cash tender
offer for any and all outstanding $443.5 million aggregate
principal amount of 11.75% Senior Discount Debentures due
2009 (the “2009 Debentures”) on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in KCSM’s Offer to Purchase and
Consent Solicitation Statement dated April 1, 2005. KCSM
also solicited consents for amendments to the indenture under
which the 2009 Debentures were issued. Holders who tendered
their 2009 Debentures were required to consent to the proposed
amendments and holders who consented were required to tender
their 2009 Debentures.

On April 14, 2005, $386.0 million principal amount of
the outstanding $443.5 million principal amount,
representing approximately 87% of the 2009 Debentures, had been
tendered on or prior to the consent deadline pursuant to the
consent solicitation and tender offer for the 2009 Debentures.
As a result of such consents and early tenders, KCSM received
the requisite consents to execute a supplemental indenture
relating to the 2009 Debentures. As part of its tender offer for
the 2009 Debentures, KCSM was soliciting consents to eliminate
substantially all of the restrictive covenants included in the
indenture under which the 2009 Debentures were issued and to
reduce the minimum prior notice period with respect to a
redemption date for outstanding 2009 Debentures from 30 to
3 days. The supplemental indenture relating to the 2009
Debentures containing the proposed changes was executed by KCSM
and the Trustee under the indenture. KCSM made payment for these
2009 Debentures pursuant to the early tender provisions of the
tender offer on April 20, 2005. Pursuant to the terms of
the 2009 Debentures, as amended by the supplemental indenture,
KCSM called for redemption of all its remaining outstanding 2009
Debentures that were not tendered in KCSM’s previously
announced tender offer and on April 29, 2005, paid an
aggregate of $60.0 million, including principal and
interest, to the holders of such 2009 Debentures to complete the
redemption of all of such remaining outstanding 2009 Debentures.

On April 19, 2005, KCSM issued $460.0 million
principal amount of


/


% senior
notes due 2012 (the
“9


/


% Senior
Notes”). The


/


% Senior
Notes are denominated in U.S. Dollars, bear interest
semiannually at a fixed rate of


/


%
and mature on May 1, 2012. The


/


% Senior
Notes are redeemable, at KCSM’s option, in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, on and after May 1,
2009, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice.
Subject to certain conditions, up to 35% of the principal amount
of the


/


% Senior
Notes is redeemable prior to May 1, 2008. In addition, the


/


% Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole but not in
part, at KCSM’s option at 100% of their principal amount,
together with accrued interest, in the event of certain changes
in the Mexican withholding tax rate.

The


/

Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of KCSM, rank
pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of KCSM, and are senior to
all of KCSM’s subordinated debt. The


/


% Senior
Notes effectively rank junior to all of KCSM’s secured
indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness. The

are therefore effectively subordinated to all liabilities of
KCSM’s subsidiaries. The

rights agreement with the placement agents engaged in the
offering of the


/


% Senior
Notes, or the Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, KCSM agreed, for the
benefit of the holders of the


/


% Senior Notes, at the cost to KCSM, to use its
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) file a registration statement with respect to a
    registered offer to exchange the


/


% Senior
    Notes for new exchange notes having terms identical in all
    material respects to the

KCSM filed the registration statement and completed the
registered exchange offer in accordance with the terms of the
Registration Rights Agreement.

On April 18, 2005, KCSM entered into a first waiver and
amendment (the “Waiver and Amendment”) to its First
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 24,
2004, with the banks which are a party thereto and
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The
Waiver and Amendment allowed KCSM to issue the


/


% Senior
Notes in a principal amount in excess of the principal amount of
2009 Debentures outstanding and to use the amount of proceeds
from the private placement of the


/


% Senior
Notes in excess of the principal amount of the 2009 Debentures
outstanding to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the 2009
Debentures repurchased or redeemed, to pay the fees of the
underwriter associated with the issuance of the


/


% Senior
Notes as well as the tender offer for the 2009 Debentures, to
pay the premium related to the tender offer and to pay certain
other expenses relating to the tender offer and issuance of the


/


% Senior Notes. The Waiver and Amendment also
amended the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to allow
KCSM to borrow up to $25 million from KCS on a fully
subordinated basis.

KCSM New Credit Agreement.

On October 24, 2005, KCSM
entered into a new credit agreement (the “2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement”) in an aggregate amount of up to
$106 million with Bank of America, N.A., BBVA Bancomer,
S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero
BBVA Bancomer, and the other lenders named in the 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement consists of a
$30 million revolving credit facility and a
$76 million term loan facility and is secured by the
locomotives and rail cars owned by KCSM’s subsidiary,
Arrendadora. Proceeds from the credit agreement were used by
KCSM to pay all amounts outstanding under the Bridge Loan
Agreement dated September 15, 2005, to pay all remaining
amounts outstanding under the $186.4 million First Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 24, 2004,
and for other general corporate purposes. The maturity date for
the credit facility is October 28, 2008. The 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit
certain actions by KCSM, including, but not limited to, its
ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make
prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends, make investments,
engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue
capital stock, sell certain assets, and engage in mergers and
consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions. Except for
certain circumstances, KCSM’s capital expenditures may not
exceed certain amounts for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters. In addition, KCSM must meet certain consolidated
interest coverage ratios, consolidated leverage ratios, and
fixed charge coverage ratios. Failure to maintain compliance
with covenants would constitute a default. Other events of
default include, but are not limited to, certain payment
defaults, certain bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings, a
change of control, and certain adverse judgments or government
actions. Any event of default could trigger acceleration of the
time for payment of any amounts outstanding under the 2005 KCSM
Credit Agreement.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On April 7, 2006 KCSM entered into an amendment and waiver
(“Amendment and Waiver”) to the 2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement was amended to
(i) exclude certain payment obligations accrued under two
locomotive maintenance agreements and under a track maintenance
rehabilitation agreement from the definition of Indebtedness,
(ii) eliminate certain minimum and multiple borrowing
thresholds for peso borrowings under the revolving credit
facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting requirement to
provide unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
fourth fiscal quarter. The Amendment and Waiver also waived
(x) certain reporting requirements, including the
requirement of KCSM to provide audited consolidated financial
statements 90 days after the end of the 2005 fiscal year,
provided such reports are delivered by April 30, 2006 and
(y) compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
obligations of Section 7.1(c) of the 2005 KCSM Credit
Agreement for the four quarters ending December 31, 2005 if
compliance therewith was calculated without giving effect to the
amendment to the definition of “Indebtedness” in the
Amendment and Waiver,

provided

that KCSM is in compliance
therewith after giving effect to the Amendment and Waiver.

Leases and Debt Maturities.

The Company and its
subsidiaries lease transportation equipment, as well as office
and other operating facilities under various capital and
operating leases. Rental expenses under operating leases were
$103.0 million and $57.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Contingent
rentals and sublease rentals were not significant. Minimum

Other Agreements, Guarantees, Provisions and
Restrictions.

The Company has debt agreements containing
restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness, advances and transfers
of assets, and sale and leaseback transactions, as well as
requiring compliance with various financial covenants. Because
of certain financial covenants contained in the debt agreements,
however, maximum utilization of the Company’s available
line of credit may be restricted.

Change in Control Provisions.

Certain loan agreements and
debt instruments entered into or guaranteed by the Company and
its subsidiaries provide for default in the event of a specified
change in control of the Company or particular subsidiaries of
the Company.

Note 6.

Income Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
reported on the Company’s income tax return, and deferred
tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
assets and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax
rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse.
Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amount considered likely to be realized.

Tax Expense.

Income tax provision (benefit) consists of
the following components

effective income tax rates and the U.S. federal income tax
statutory rates of 35% are as follows

(in millions):

Other, net for 2004 includes certain adjustments of prior year
provision estimates resulting in a $1.1 million increase in
tax expense.

Difference Attributable to KCSM Investment.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company’s book basis exceeded
the tax basis of its investment in KCSM by $496.9 million.
The Company has not provided a deferred income tax liability for
the income taxes, if any, which might become payable on the
realization of this basis difference because the Company intends
to indefinitely reinvest in KCSM the financial accounting
earnings which gave rise to the basis differential. Moreover,
the Company has no other plans to realize this basis
differential by a sale of its investment in KCSM. If the Company
were to realize this basis difference in the future by a receipt
of dividends or the sale of its interest in KCSM, as of
December 31, 2005 the Company would incur gross federal
income taxes of $173.9 million, which might be partially
offset by Mexican income taxes.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo TFM
on April 1, 2005, Grupo TFM provided deferred income taxes
for the difference between the financial reporting and income
tax bases of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its
proportionate share of these income taxes through its equity in
Grupo TFM’s earnings. Since April 1, 2005, Grupo TFM
income taxes are reflected in the consolidated results. Although
KCSM has generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due
primarily to the accelerated tax amortization of the concession
rights. We have recognized a deferred income tax asset for the
resulting net operating loss carryforwards and may continue to
recognize additional amounts in the next few years. Management
anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
realized given the expiration dates (through the year 2046) of
the loss carryforwards, as well as the fact that we expect to
generate taxable income in the future. Our tax projections take
into consideration certain assumptions, some of which are under
our control and others which are not. Key assumptions include
inflation rates, currency fluctuations and future revenue
growth. If our assumptions are not correct, we may have to
recognize a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset.

As described in Note 3, on September 12, 2005, the
Company and its subsidiaries, KCSM and Grupo TFM, along with
TMM, entered into a settlement agreement with the Mexican
government, resolving the controversies and disputes between the
companies and the Mexican government concerning the payment of



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a value added tax (“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the
obligation (“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of
KCSM owned by the Mexican government (the “VAT/ Put
Settlement”). All Mexican income taxes on the VAT were paid
as part of the VAT/ Put Settlement. The Company believes, based
upon opinions of outside legal counsel and other factors, that
the VAT/ Put Settlement should not be taxable to KCS for
U.S. income tax purposes. Such position has not been
examined by the taxing authority and it is possible that this
position could be challenged. The amount of such tax would be
material; however the Company believes that it would have the
right to indemnification under the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement.

Tax Carryovers.

In the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, the Company generated both U.S. federal and state
net operating losses. The losses are carried forward
20 years for federal and from 5 to 20 years for
state.

Both the federal and state loss carryovers are analyzed each
year to determine the likelihood of realization. The
U.S. federal loss carryover at December 31, 2005 is
approximately $117.6 million and will expire beginning in
2023. The Company believes the Federal loss carryover will be
realized.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and
separately filed tax filings from as early as 1991. The loss
carryovers may expire as early as December 31, 2006 and as
late as December 31, 2025. The state loss carryover at
December 31, 2005 is $497.9 million (approximately
$16.2 million of tax), of which it is expected that
$291.8 million (approximately $9.5 million of tax)
will expire without utilization, leaving $206.1 million
(approximately $6.7 million of tax) expected to be
realized. Management believes that deferred tax assets, net of
the valuation allowance, will be ultimately realized.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at December 31, 2005 are
approximately $1.5 billion (Mexican pesos of approximately
15.7 billion) and will expire as early as 2007 and as late
as 2046. The Company believes the Mexican loss carryovers will
be realized.

Internal Revenue Service reviews.

The IRS is currently in
the process of reviewing the consolidated federal income tax
returns for the years 1997 through 1999. The examination is
expected to be completed during 2006 so a current income tax
liability has been accrued for the anticipated outcome. In
addition, other tax authorities are currently reviewing the
years 2000 through 2004. The Company believes that adequate
provision has been made for any adjustment (taxes and interest)
that may be assessed for all open years.

In 2004, the IRS concluded reviews of the 1990-1996 tax years.
The Company received $21.6 million in tax refunds
($37.6 million including interest) from adjustments arising
in those years. The Company recognized interest income in the
financial statements as an increase of $10.3 million to
other income, an increase in deferred taxes of
$21.5 million and an increase of $6.0 million in other
liabilities (primarily interest and amounts due to former
affiliates) offset by an increase in current tax expense of
$0.2 million. The federal statute of limitations has closed
for years prior to 1997.

Stock Option Plans.

The Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended
and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan (as amended
and restated effective May 5, 2004) provides for the
granting of options to purchase up to 16.0 million shares
of the Company’s common stock by officers and other
designated employees. Options have been granted under this plan
at 100% of the average market price of the Company’s stock
on the date of grant and generally may not be exercised sooner
than one year or longer than ten years following the date of the
grant, except that options outstanding with limited rights
(“LRs”) or limited stock appreciation rights
(“LSARs”), become immediately exercisable upon certain
defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the
Company. The plan includes provisions for stock appreciation
rights, LRs and LSARs. All outstanding options include LSARs,
except for options granted to non-employee Directors prior to
1999.

For purposes of computing the pro forma effects of option grants
under the fair value accounting method prescribed by
SFAS 123, the fair value of each option grant is estimated
on the date of grant using a version of the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The following assumptions were used for the
various grants depending on the date of grant, nature of vesting
and term of option:

volatility that reflect an average of the most recent three
years volatility of KCS common stock.

Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”), established in 1977, provides substantially
all full-time employees of the Company, certain subsidiaries and
certain other affiliated entities, with the right to subscribe
to an aggregate of 11.4 million shares of common stock. For
offerings under the Fifteenth Offering of the ESPP, the purchase
price for shares were 85% of the average market price on either
the exercise date or the offering date, whichever was lower, but
in no event less than the par value of the shares. For offerings
under the Seventeenth and Sixteenth Offerings, the purchase
prices for shares was 90% of the average market price on either
the exercise date or the offering date, whichever

At December 31, 2005, there were approximately
4.2 million shares available for future ESPP offerings.

For purposes of computing the pro forma effects of
employees’ purchase rights under the fair value accounting
method prescribed by SFAS 123, the fair value of the
offerings under the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using
a version of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
following weighted-average assumptions were used for the
Seventeenth, Sixteenth, and Fifteenth Offerings, respectively:
i) dividend yield of 0.00%, 0.00% and 0.00%; ii) expected
volatility of 27%, 27% and 35%; iii) risk-free interest rate of
3.41%, 2.85% and 1.26%; and iv) expected life of one year. The
weighted-average fair value of purchase rights granted under the
Seventeenth, Sixteenth, and Fifteenth Offerings of the ESPP were
$3.98, $2.96 and $2.95, respectively.

Restricted Stock.

The Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended
and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan provides
for the granting of restricted stock awards to officers and
other designated employees. These awards are subject to
forfeiture if employment terminates during the vesting period,
which is generally five year cliff vesting for employees and one
year for directors. For the year ended December 31, 2005
399,591 restricted shares were granted at a
weighted-average fair value of $20.53 per share. The value
of restricted shares is amortized to expense over the vesting
period. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the Company
expensed $8.2 million related to restricted stock
compensation earned.

Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
Stock — Series C.

On May 5, 2003, the
Company completed the sale of $200 million of Redeemable
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
(“Convertible Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation
preference of $500 per share in a private offering.
Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative and
are payable quarterly at an annual rate of 4.25% of the
liquidation preference, when, as and if declared by the
Company’s board of



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

directors. Accumulated unpaid dividends will accumulate
dividends at the same rate as dividends accumulate on the
Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of the Convertible
Preferred Stock will be convertible, under certain conditions,
and subject to adjustment under certain conditions, into
33.4728 shares of the Company’s common stock. On or
after May 20, 2008, the Company will have the option to
redeem any or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to
certain conditions. Under certain circumstances, at the option
of the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company
may be required to purchase shares of the Convertible Preferred
Stock from the holders. The Convertible Preferred Stock is
redeemable at the option of a holder only in the event of a
“fundamental change,” which is defined as “any
transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer,
liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger, combination,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in connection
with which all or substantially all of the Company’s common
stock is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or
constitutes solely the right to receive common stock that is not
listed on a U.S. national securities exchange or approved
for quotation on the NASDAQ National Market or similar system.
The practical effect of this provision is to limit the
Company’s ability to eliminate a holder’s ability to
convert the Convertible Preferred Stock into common shares of a
publicly traded security through a merger or consolidation
transaction. In no other circumstances is the Company
potentially obligated to redeem the Convertible Preferred Stock
for cash. Accordingly, since the Company is in a position to
control whether the Company experiences a “fundamental
change,” the Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as
permanent equity capital.

Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock —
Series D.

On December 9, 2005, KCS completed the
sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its


/


%
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
$1.00 per share (the “Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock”). Each share of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time, into shares of KCS
common stock at a conversion rate of 33.3333 shares of KCS
common stock for each share of Series D Convertible
Preferred Stock subject to adjustments to the conversion rate as
a result of dividends or distributions payable in shares of KCS
common stock, subdivision or reclassification of shares of KCS
common stock, and other events in which the KCS common stock may
be diluted as provided in the Certificate of Designations of


/


%
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock of Kansas City
Southern (“Certificate of Designations”). Dividends on
the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are payable,
quarterly in arrears, at the discretion of the Company in cash,
in KCS common stock or any combination thereof, when, as and if
declared by the KCS board of directors, at the rate of
5.125% per annum of the liquidation preference of $1,000.
Dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will
be cumulative from the date of issuance. Accumulated but unpaid
dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
accumulate at the annual rate of 5.125%. The Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock and
to each class or series of KCS capital stock that has terms that
provide that such class or series will rank junior to the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and includes a
liquidation preference that entitles the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock holders to payment of
$1,000 per share of Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not
declared) accumulated and unpaid on the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock to the date of a final distribution
in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or

winding-up

of KCS,
before any payment or distribution of the KCS’s assets
shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any KCS capital
stock ranking junior to the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock. On or after February 20, 2011, KCS may, at its
option, cause all, and not less than all, of the outstanding
shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to be
automatically converted into shares of KCS common stock at the
then prevailing conversion rate, but only if the closing sale
price of the KCS common stock multiplied by the conversion rate
then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation
preference for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading
day period, and if KCS has paid all accumulated and unpaid
dividends on the dividend payment date immediately preceding the
forced conversion date.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Upon certain designated events (a “fundamental change”
as defined by the Certificate of Designation), holders of the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may, subject to
legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or all of
their shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at the
liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid
dividends to the date of redemption, which KCS may pay in either
cash, in shares of KCS common stock, or any combination thereof
at KCS’s option. The Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock is redeemable at the option of a holder only in the event
of a “fundamental change,” which is defined as
“any transaction or event (whether by means of an exchange
offer, liquidation, tender offer, consolidation, merger,
combination, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) in
connection with which 50% or more of the Common Stock of the
Corporation is exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or
constitutes solely the right to receive consideration which is
not at least 90% shares of common stock that (i) are listed
on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be listed
on, a United States national securities exchange, or
(ii) are approved, or immediately after the transaction or
event will be approved, for quotation thereof in an inter-dealer
quotation system of any registered United States national
securities association. Prior to February 20, 2016 and
within ten days of notice of a fundamental change, if the holder
of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock tenders the
stock for conversion, the holder will be entitled to additional
shares in the form of a “make whole payment” as
specified by the agreement. Since KCS has the ability, in the
event of a fundamental change, to pay the redemption price in
shares of KCS common stock (which are not required to be
registered shares), the Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock is classified as permanent equity capital. The number of
shares to be issued would be based upon the value of KCS common
stock at that time. In no event will the number of shares issued
on the occurrence of a fundamental change exceed
52.5 million shares.

On December 12, 2005 the Company used substantially all of
the proceeds from the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
offering to repurchase 9,000,000 shares of KCS Common
Stock issued to TMM in April 2005 in connection with the
acquisition of KCSM. All of the 9,000,000 shares were
purchased at a price of $22.25 per share or
$200.3 million. The Company does not have a formal program
for the repurchase of any additional shares of our equity
securities.

Dividend Restrictions.

Following completion of the
preparation of the 2005 financial statements of KCS, the Company
determined that its Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as defined in
the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% Senior
Notes and


/


% Senior Notes) was less than 2.0:1. As a result,
pursuant to the terms of each KCSR indenture, the Company is
currently unable to pay cash dividends on its Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock and dividends in cash or shares of
KCS common stock on its Series D Convertible Preferred
Stock (as described below) and will be unable to pay such
dividends until such ratio increases to at least 2.0:1. KCS
anticipates that the ratio will increase by the end of the third
quarter of 2006 such that it will again be permitted to pay cash
dividends to these preferred stockholders although that cannot
be assured. A special meeting of the holders of record of the
Convertible Preferred Stock as of March 17, 2006 (the
“Series C Stockholders”), was held on
March 30, 2006 to vote on a proposed amendment to the terms
of the Convertible Preferred Stock to allow the payment of
dividends to the Series C Stockholders to be made, at the
discretion of the Company, in cash, in shares of KCS common
stock or in any combination thereof. As a quorum of the
Series C Stockholders was not present in person or by proxy
at the special meeting, the special meeting was adjourned
indefinitely. Absent approval of such an amendment, the
dividends for each of the Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock and the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock
(collectively, the “Preferred Stock”) will accumulate
until such time that the Company may resume paying cash
dividends to the holders of both classes of Preferred Stock.
Whenever dividends on the Preferred Stock or another class or
series of stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Stock are
in arrears for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number
of days in the aggregate) holders of the Preferred Stock will be
entitled to vote for the election of two of the authorized
directors at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and at
each subsequent Shareholders’ Meeting until such time as
all accumulated dividends are paid, set aside for payment or the
Preferred Stock has been redeemed.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

On September 27, 2005, the
Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of the
Company’s Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share to
the stockholders of record as of the close of business on
October 12, 2005 pursuant to a Rights Agreement (the
“Rights Agreement”) with UMB Bank, n.a. replacing
KCS’s previous Rights Agreement that expired on
October 12, 2005. Each Right entitles the registered holder
thereof to purchase from the Company


/


ths of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par
value $1.00 per share, or in some circumstances, Common
Stock, other securities, cash or other assets, at a price of
$100 per share (both shares and price are subject to
adjustment as described below).

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had a total of
400,000,000 shares of Common Stock authorized, of which
73,412,081 shares were issued and outstanding. The Rights
were attached to all Common Stock certificates representing
shares then outstanding, and no separate Rights Certificates
will be distributed. Subject to certain exceptions specified in
the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the Common
Stock and a Distribution Date will occur upon the earlier of
(i) ten (10) business days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated
persons has acquired beneficial ownership of fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (or
thirteen percent (13%) in the case the Independent Directors
determine such Person is an “Adverse Person”) (each
such person or group of affiliated or associated persons
referred to herein and in the Rights Agreement as an
“Acquiring Person”), or (ii) ten
(10) business days following the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group
becoming an Acquiring Person. Pursuant to exceptions set forth
in the Rights Agreement, TMM and certain of its affiliates and
stockholders have been exempted under certain circumstances from
the definition of an “Acquiring Person.”

Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be
evidenced by the Common Stock certificates and will be
transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates,
(ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record
Date will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement
by reference and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any
certificates for Common Stock outstanding will also constitute
the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock
represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable after
the Distribution Date, Rights Certificates will be mailed to
holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of
business of the Distribution Date, and thereafter the separate
Rights Certificates alone will represent the Rights. Following
the Distribution Date, shares of Common Stock issued will be
accompanied by Rights only in certain instances.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and
will expire at the close of business on October 11, 2010,
unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company as
described below.

In the event that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, except
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for all outstanding
shares of Common Stock that a majority of the Independent
Directors determines to be adequate and otherwise in the best
interests of the Company’s stockholders, taking into
consideration all factors that such directors deem relevant (a
“Permitted Offer”), each holder of a Right will
thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right
at the then current Purchase Price, that number of shares of the
Preferred Stock (or in certain circumstances, Common Stock or
assets or other securities of the Company) having a market value
of two times the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
following the occurrence of the event set forth in this
paragraph, all Rights that are or were beneficially owned by any
Acquiring Person or Adverse Person will be null and void.

In the event that, at any time following the Share Acquisition
Date, (i) the Company engages in a merger or other business
combination transaction in which the Company is not the
surviving corporation, (ii) the Company engages in a merger
or other business combination transaction in which the Company
is the surviving corporation and the Common Stock of the Company
is changed or exchanged, or (iii) fifty percent (50%) or
more of the Company’s assets, cash flow or earning power is
sold or transferred (in each



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

case other than with an entity which acquired the shares
pursuant to a Permitted Offer), each holder of a Right shall
thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right
at the then current Purchase Price, that number of shares of the
common stock of the acquiring company (or certain of its
affiliates) that at the time of such transaction would have a
market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. If
the Rights are exercised to acquire the Preferred Stock, then
the Rights will not thereafter be exercisable to acquire the
securities of any Acquiring Person. The events set forth in this
paragraph and in the second preceding paragraph are referred to
in the Rights Agreement as “Triggering Events.”

At any time until the Share Acquisition Date or the Final
Expiration Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but
not in part, at a price of $0.0025 per Right (the
“Redemption Price”). Following the Share
Acquisition Date, but prior to an event listed in
Section 13(a) of the Rights Agreement (i.e. a merger,
consolidation or sale of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
assets or earnings power of the Company and its subsidiaries),
the Company may redeem the Rights in connection with any event
specified in Section 13(a) in which all stockholders are
treated alike and which does not include the Acquiring Person or
its Affiliates or Associates. In addition, the Company’s
right of redemption may be reinstated following an inadvertent
trigger of the Rights (as determined by the Board) if an
Acquiring Person reduces its beneficial ownership to 10% or less
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company in a
transaction or series of transactions not involving the Company.
Immediately upon the action of the Board electing to redeem the
Rights, the Company shall make announcement thereof, and upon
such election, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate
and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive
the Redemption Price.

Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will
have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including,
without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to
stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending on
the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that
the Rights become exercisable for the Preferred Stock (or other
securities, as the case may be) of the Company or for common
stock of an acquiring company or in the event of the redemption
of the Rights as set forth above.

The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of
Preferred Stock (or Common Stock, other securities, cash or
other assets, as the case may be) issuable upon exercise of the
Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent
dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a
subdivision, combination or reclassification of the Preferred
Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred
Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for shares of
the Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the
current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon
the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences
of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash
dividends out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends
payable in the Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or
warrants (other than those referred to above).

With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price
will be required until cumulative adjustments require an
adjustment of at least one percent (1%) in such Purchase Price.
No fractional shares will be issued (other than fractional
shares which are integral multiples of


/


ths of a share of Preferred Stock) and, in lieu thereof,
an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of
the Preferred Stock on the last Trading Date prior to the date
of exercise.

Prior to the Distribution Date, the Board may amend or
supplement any provision of the Rights Agreement without the
consent of the holders of the Rights. Following the Distribution
Date, the Board of Directors may amend the provisions of the
Rights Agreement in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct any
defect or inconsistency or to make changes deemed necessary or
desirable, so long as such changes do not adversely affect the
interests of the holders of the Rights (excluding the interests
of any Acquiring Person and its affiliates and associates). In
any case, however, the Board of Directors may not amend or



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

supplement the Rights Agreement to change or supplement the
Redemption Price, Final Expiration Date, the Purchase Price
or the number of


/


ths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right is
exercisable.

The Rights may have the effect of impeding a change in control
of the Company without the prior consent of the Board, and the
Rights could cause substantial dilution to a person that
attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer
on redemption of the Rights by the Board or on the acquisition
by such person of a substantial number of Rights. The Rights
will not interfere with any Permitted Offer for all of the
outstanding Common Stock that has the approval of the
Independent Directors.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and certain of
its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with employees
whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a change in
control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock options
become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
event of a specified change in control of the Company or
subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts at December 31, 2005
were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at the time
of any such change in control, the most significant factor of
which would be the highest price paid for KCS common stock by a
party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Note 8.

Profit Sharing and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains various plans for the benefit of its
employees as described below. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company expensed
$1.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.9 million,
respectively, related to the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan
(the “401(k) Plan”). During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company did not recognize any expense relative to profit sharing
or the ESOP.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The 401(k) Plan permits
participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant
to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and also
allows employees to direct their profit sharing accounts into
selected investments. The Company matched employee 401(k)
contributions up to a maximum of 5% of compensation in 2005,
2004 and 2003. Qualified profit sharing plans are maintained for
most employees not included in collective bargaining agreements.
Contributions by the Company and its subsidiaries are made at
the discretion of the Board of Directors of KCS in amounts not
to exceed the maximum allowable for federal income tax purposes.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

KCS established the ESOP
for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
KCS contributions to the ESOP are based on a percentage of wages
earned by eligible employees. Contributions and percentages are
determined by the Compensation and Organization Committee of the
Board of Directors.

Other Postretirement Benefits.

The Company provides
certain medical, life and other postretirement benefits other
than pensions to its retirees. The medical and life plans are
available to employees not covered under collective bargaining
arrangements, who have attained age 60 and rendered ten
years of service. Individuals employed as of December 31,
1992 were excluded from a specific service requirement. The
medical plan is contributory and provides benefits for retirees,
their covered dependents and beneficiaries. The medical plan
provides for an annual adjustment of retiree contributions, and
also contains, depending on the plan coverage selected, certain
deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance and coordination with
Medicare. Certain management employees also maintain their
status under a collective bargaining agreement, which permits
them access to postretirement medical under the multiemployer
plan



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

described below. Assumptions related to medical postretirement
benefits plan were adjusted in 2004 to reflect the expected
participation of these individuals in the multiemployer plan.
The life insurance plan is non-contributory and covers retirees
only. The Company’s policy, in most cases, is to fund
benefits payable under these plans as the obligations become
due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds held in a
life insurance company) exist with respect to life insurance
benefits. A life insurance company holds these assets and the
Company receives an investment return on these assets based on
the six-month Treasury bill rate plus 25 basis points.

For the KCS Plan, during 2005, the Company revised its
postretirement medical plan to exclude prescription drug
coverage where it is available under Medicare Part D. As a
result of this negative plan amendment, the actuarial valuation
of the accumulated pension benefit obligation includes
unrecognized prior service cost benefit of $2.3 million
which will be amortized over the estimated remaining life of the
affected participants of 9.5 years.

The Gateway Western benefit plans are slightly different from
those of the Company and other subsidiaries. Gateway Western
provides contributory health, dental and life insurance benefits
to these remaining employees and retirees. Based upon current
regulations, the Gateway Western’s plans are actuarially
equivalent to Medicare part D benefits; however, provisions
within the plans contain retiree cost sharing features, which
make any potential benefit to KCS from the subsidy entitlement
unlikely to be material.

The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for
its postretirement benefit obligations.

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The Company’s health care costs, excluding former Gateway
Western employees and certain former employees of the MidSouth,
are limited to the increase in the Consumer Price Index
(“CPI”) with a maximum annual increase of 5%.
Accordingly, health care costs in excess of the CPI limit will
be borne by the plan participants, and therefore assumptions
regarding health care cost trend rates are not applicable. The
expected rate of return on life insurance plan assets is the
return, over the period that benefits are expected to be paid.
In determining the expected long-term rate of return, the
Company considered forward looking information and historical
returns for similar investments.

The assumed annual rate of increase in health care costs for
Gateway Western employees and retirees under the Gateway Western
plan is as follows:

An increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend
rates by one percent in 2005, 2004 and 2003 would not have a
significant impact on the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation or on the aggregate of the service and interest
components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost.

Multi-employer Plan

Under collective bargaining agreements, KCSR participates in a
multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain
post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits to
eligible union employees and certain retirees. Premiums under
this plan are expensed as incurred and were $2.6 million,
$1.9 million and $1.7 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Based on existing rates, premium amounts are not
expected to change substantially in 2006 compared to 2005.

Note 9.

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal
proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are of an
ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
current and former employees for job related injuries and by
third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. We
aggressively defend these matters and have established liability
reserves which management believes are adequate to cover
expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the
outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of the
Company’s management, other than those proceedings
described in detail below, such proceedings and actions should
not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition.

Reinsurance Litigation.

The Company has established its
personal injury and casualty reserves based on an assumption
that it and its other insured or reinsured subsidiaries would
have the benefit of insurance under existing policies. Several
reinsurers of the Company’s captive insurer have filed a
declaratory judgment action in federal court in Vermont seeking
a declaration that, based on a claimed lack of notice, they have
no obligation to provide coverage for a set of lawsuits
currently pending against a subsidiary of the Company. The
Company’s captive insurer has answered and filed a
counterclaim to establish its right to coverage. The Company
presently believes that it has a strong basis to establish that
notice was properly delivered and that it has a right to
coverage. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in the
litigation with the reinsurance carriers and the damages in the
underlying litigation exceed the self insured retention, the
Company would not have reinsurance to cover such excess. While
the Company is not presently able to reliably estimate such
amounts, those additional amounts could be material. In the
event the Company is unsuccessful in the reinsurance litigation,
the Company believes it would have a strong claim against third
parties responsible for providing notice to the reinsurers for
any damages caused by the loss of the insurance coverage. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any accruals
related to the possible lack of insurance coverage from the
reinsurers.

Stilwell Tax Dispute.

On October 15, 2004, KCS and
Janus Capital Group Inc. (“Janus”), formerly Stilwell
Financial Inc. (“Stilwell”), finalized a settlement
agreement (“Release”), effecting settlement of all
disputes which arose on or before August 13, 2004 relating
to the spin-off of Stilwell from KCS on July 12, 2000 (the
“Spin-off”). As part of the settlement, all
arbitration claims filed by the parties with the American
Arbitration Association were dismissed. This claim involved the
entitlement to compensation expense deductions for federal
income tax purposes, associated with the exercise of certain
stock options issued by Stilwell (the “Substituted
Options”) in connection with the Spin-off. Prior to the
settlement, amounts related to the tax benefits of exercises of
the Substituted Options were recorded as a noncurrent liability
in the consolidated financial statements pending resolution of
this dispute. As a result of this settlement, the Company
reclassified approximately $27.1 million in tax benefits
from previous exercises of the Substituted Options to additional
paid in capital on the balance sheet. As previously disclosed,
the settlement had no adverse consequences to the Company.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s operations
are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental
laws and regulations. The major environmental laws, to which the
Company is subject, include, among others, the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), the
Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act.
CERCLA can impose joint and several liabilities for cleanup and
investigation costs, without regard to fault or legality of the
original conduct, on current and predecessor owners and
operators of a site, as well as those who generate, or arrange
for the disposal of, hazardous substances. The Company does not
foresee that compliance with the requirements imposed by the
environmental legislation will impair its competitive capability
or result in any material additional capital expenditures,
operating or maintenance costs.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
chemicals industry, KCSR transports hazardous materials and has
a professional team available to respond and handle
environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
materials. Additionally, the Company is a partner in the
Responsible
Care

®

program and, as a result, has initiated certain additional
environmental, health and safety programs. KCSR performs ongoing
reviews and evaluations of the various environmental programs
and issues within the Company’s operations, and, as
necessary, takes actions to limit the Company’s exposure to
potential liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
investigation and cleanup of contaminants, claims alleging
personal injury, or property damage as the result of exposures
to, or release of, hazardous substances. Although the Company is
responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at
several locations, based on currently available information, the
Company does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
collectively, to have a material impact on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows. In the event that
the Company becomes subject to more stringent cleanup
requirements at these sites, discovers additional contamination,
or becomes subject to related personal or property damage
claims, the Company could incur material costs in connection
with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
costs related to past activities when the Company’s
obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Casualty Claim Reserves.

The Company’s casualty and
liability reserve for its U.S. business segment is based on
a study by an independent third party actuarial firm performed
on an undiscounted basis. The reserve is based on claims filed
and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While
the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims.
Adjustments to the liability are reflected as operating expenses
in the period in which the adjustments are known. Casualty
claims in excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to
certain coverage amounts, depending on the type of claim and
year of occurrence. The activity in the reserve for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (in
millions):

During the third quarter, the Company initiated a new
comprehensive actuarial study of all of its casualty reserves.
Based on that study, the reserves for FELA, third-party, and
occupational illness claims were increased, resulting in a
charge to third quarter operating income of $37.8 million.
The charge reflects the impact of higher settlements for major
FELA and third-party claims and significant increases in the
frequency of these claims in 2004 and 2005. In addition, the
charge includes reserves for occupational illness including
asbestos-related claims that were established on an actuarial
basis for the first time.

Reserves for occupational illness claims were previously
established through an assessment made on a case-by-case basis,
and a liability was established when management determined that
it was probable and reasonably estimable. No provision was made
for occupational illness claims that may have been incurred but
not yet reported, since the Company believed the low end of the
range of reasonably possible loss was not material. During 2005
the Company experienced a marked increase in the number of such
claims. Accordingly, the Company requested and obtained an
actuarial study of these potential unasserted claims for the
first time. The study indicated that existing reserves should be
increased by $7.5 million.

Based on the results of the actuarial study, reserves for FELA
and third-party claims were increased by $30.3 million. The
majority of these increases are attributable to adverse
experience occurring since last year’s study, including an
increase in the number of new claims and adverse development in
the dollar amount of potential settlements for many significant
prior claims.

Management believes that its previous reserve estimates for
those prior claims were reasonable based on the information
available at the time. The Company is continuing its practice of
accruing monthly for estimated claim costs at levels recommended
by the actuarial study and evaluation of recent known trends,
and those accruals have been increased accordingly.

Disputes Relating to Payments for the use of Trackage and
Haulage Rights and Interline Services.

KCSM and Ferrocarril
Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”) both initiated
administrative proceedings seeking a determination by the

Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes

(“Secretariat of Communications and Transports” or
“SCT”) of the rates that we should pay each other in
connection with the use of trackage and haulage rights and
interline and terminal services. The SCT, on March 13,
2002, issued a ruling setting the rates for trackage and haulage
rights. On August 5, 2002, the SCT issued a ruling setting
the rates for interline and terminal services. KCSM and Ferromex
appealed both rulings and, following trial and appellate court
decisions, the Mexican Supreme Court on February 24, 2006,
in a



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ruling from the bench, sustained KCSM’s appeal of the
SCT’s trackage and haulage rights ruling, vacating the
ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent
with the Court’s opinion. KCSM has not yet received the
written opinion of the Mexican Supreme Court relating to the
decision announced on February 24, 2006 decision, nor has
the Mexican Supreme Court decided the interline and terminal
services appeal. We believe that even if the rates set in 2002
become effective, there will be no material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Disputes Relating to the Exercise of Trackage Rights.

KCSM and Ferromex are also parties to various civil cases
involving disputes over the application and proper
interpretation of the mandatory trackage rights, none of which
we believe to be material individually or in the aggregate.

Disputes Relating to the Scope of the Mandatory Trackage
Rights.

In August 2002, the SCT issued rulings
determining Ferromex’s trackage rights in Monterrey and
KCSM’s trackage rights in Altamira. KCSM and Ferromex both
appealed the SCT’s rulings. At the administrative federal
court level, KCSM obtained favorable rulings in both cases.
Ferromex appealed these rulings. In connection with the Altamira
proceedings, on August 10, 2005, an appellate court granted
Ferromex’s appeal and ordered the Administrative Federal
Court determined to vacate its prior resolution and issue a new
resolution declaring as null and void the SCT’s
determination that KCSM’s trackage rights should include
access to the Port of Altamira. In connection with the Monterrey
proceedings, the case was remanded to the Administrative Federal
Court with the instructions to consider additional arguments
before issuing its ruling. KCSM is still awaiting that ruling.

Track maintenance and rehabilitation agreement.

In May
2000, KCSM entered into a track maintenance and rehabilitation
agreement with a Mexican subsidiary of Alstom. The agreement
expires in 2012. Under this agreement, the contractor performed
a major rehabilitation of the line and provides routine
maintenance between Celaya and Lázaro Cárdenas,
approximately 350 miles. Maintenance and rehabilitation
expense amounted to $3.4 million in 2005.

Panama Canal Railway Company.

Under certain limited
conditions, the Company is a guarantor for up to
$5.6 million of cash deficiencies associated with the
operations of PCRC. In addition, the Company is a guarantor for
up to $3.0 million of equipment loans. Further, if the
Company or its partner terminates the concession contract
without the consent of IFC, the Company is a guarantor for up to
50% of the outstanding senior loans. See Note 3.

Heavener Fueling Facility and Pipeline.

The Company has
entered into an agreement to transport locomotive diesel fuel
via pipeline into the Company’s fuel facility in Heavener,
Oklahoma. The pipeline was completed and placed in service in
May 2004. The contract provides that the Company will pay to the
supplier transportation fees based on published tariff rates per
barrel. The contract further requires that for a period of ten
years after the pipeline is placed in service, the fees will be
at least $1.5 million per year.

Note 10.

Derivative Instruments and Purchase Commitments

The Company does not engage in the trading of derivatives. The
Company’s objective for using derivative instruments is to
manage its fuel price risk and mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in fuel prices. In general, the Company enters into
derivative transactions in limited situations based on
management’s assessment of current market conditions and
perceived risks. Management intends to respond to evolving
business and market conditions in order to manage risks and
exposures associated with the Company’s various operations,
and in doing so, may enter into such transactions more
frequently as deemed appropriate.



KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fuel Derivative Transactions

At December 31, 2005, the Company was not a party to any
fuel swap agreements. Fuel hedging transactions, including fuel
swaps as well as forward purchase commitments, resulted in a
decrease in fuel expense of $2.4 million,
$3.0 million, and $1.1 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 KCS entered
into fuel swap agreements for 3.2 million gallons.

Foreign exchange contracts.

The purpose of KCSM’s
foreign exchange contracts is to limit the risks arising from
exchange rate fluctuations in its Mexican

peso-denominated

monetary assets and liabilities. The nature and quantity of any
hedging transactions will be determined by management based upon
net asset exposure and market conditions.

As of December 31, 2005, KCSM had two Mexican peso call
options outstanding in the notional amount of $1.2 million
and $1.7 million, respectively, based on the average
exchange rate of 13.00 pesos per dollar and
12.50 pesos per dollar. These options expire on
September 6 and May 30, 2006, respectively. The
premiums paid were $16 and $34, respectively, and were expensed
since these contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting. As
of December 31, 2005, KCSM did not have any outstanding
forward contracts.

Foreign currency balances.

At December 31, 2005 and
2004, KCSM had monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
Mexican pesos of Ps1,088 million and Ps549 million and
of Ps1,057 million and Ps290 million, respectively. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the exchange rate was
11.14 pesos per dollar and 10.73 pesos per dollar,
respectively.

Southern Capital

The Company records adjustments to its stockholders’ equity
(accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) for its portion
of the adjustment to the fair value of derivative transactions
to which Southern Capital was a participant. The Company also
adjusts its investment in Southern Capital by the change in the
fair value of these derivative instruments. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a reduction to its
stockholders equity (accumulated other comprehensive loss) of
approximately $0.3 million for its portion of the amount
recorded by Southern Capital for the adjustment to the fair
value of its interest rate swap transactions. The Company also
reduced its investment in Southern Capital by the same amount.

During 2002, in conjunction with the refinancing of its debt,
Southern Capital terminated these interest rate swap
transactions. As a result, Southern Capital is amortizing the
balance of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into
interest expense over the former remaining life of the interest
rate swap transactions. The Company is recording the impact of
this charge through a related reduction in equity earnings from
Southern Capital and is amortizing the related accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) balance to its investment in
Southern Capital. During the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, the Company recorded related amortization of
$0.5 million, $0.5 million and $1.2 million,
respectively.

Restatement of Prior Periods

During the preparation of its year-end financial reports for
2005 certain errors were identified in the calculation of the
Company’s deferred income tax balances which arose in the
years prior to 2003. The Company has determined that its
deferred tax liability balance at December 31, 2002 and
subsequent dates was understated by approximately
$8 million. The Company has also determined that the errors
had no material impact on earnings as reported in the annual
periods ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included in
this Annual Report on
Form

for the
year ended December 31, 2005 include an adjustment to
previously presented consolidated balance sheets to reflect
reductions of retained earnings at December 31, 2002 and

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
    Accounting and Financial Disclosure

There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and
financial disclosure matters.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”)), as of the end of the fiscal year for which this
annual report on
Form

10-K

is
filed. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s
current disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure due to the material
weakness described in “Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting” in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K.

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

KCS management considers the acquisition of Grupo TFM and KCSM
on April 1, 2005 to be material to the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows from the date of
acquisition through December 31, 2005 and considers the
internal controls and procedures of Grupo TFM and KCSM to have a
material affect on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Management is currently executing post
merger integration plans which include converting accounting
information systems and ongoing internal control evaluation. KCS
intends to extend its Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404
compliance program to include Grupo TFM and KCSM with an
effective date no later than December 31, 2006.

Except as set forth above, there have not been any changes in
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during our last fiscal quarter (our fourth quarter
in the case of an annual report) that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(c) Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The report of management on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Exchange Act) is included as “Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” in Item 8.
During its closing process for the 2005 fiscal year, the Company
concluded that a reduction of approximately $8 million in
the amount of its retained earnings account was necessary to
correct an error in the amounts recorded for deferred income
taxes payable in the year ended December 31, 2002. The
Company has determined that its deferred tax liability was
understated by approximately $8 million and that its
retained earnings were overstated by that amount as of
December 31, 2002. Additionally, a material misstatement
was identified in the income tax provision in the 2005
consolidated financial statements that was corrected prior to
the issuance of such financial statements.

As stated in “Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting” in Item 8 of this
Form

10-K,

the
Company’s management has concluded that there is a material
weakness in the Company’s existing internal control over
financial reporting.

The Company’s tax department, in conjunction with the
Company’s management and Audit Committee, has developed a
plan of remedial action to improve the internal controls with
respect to the analysis of the deferred tax asset and liability
balances to discover and correct such errors in the future. The
remedial action includes (i) the timely preparation of
rollforwards of fixed asset balances from book



cost to tax basis to produce tax basis fixed asset amounts that
are appropriately reconciled to tax provisions and tax returns,
(ii) increased tax department staffing and financial
management oversight to ensure an adequate level of review of
the deferred tax balances, (iii) conversion of a
spreadsheet based tax fixed asset system to the Company’s
enterprise account system used to maintain the financial books
of the Company, and (iv) additional training of the tax
department staff in the use of the accounting tools.
