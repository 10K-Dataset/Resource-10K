Business

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding
    company with domestic and international rail operations in North
    America that are strategically focused on the growing
    north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and
    industrial markets in the central United States with major
    industrial cities in Mexico. As used herein, “KCS” or
    the “Company” may refer to Kansas City Southern or, as
    the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of Kansas City
    Southern. KCS and its subsidiaries had approximately
    6,485 employees on December 31, 2007. The Kansas City
    Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), which was founded
    in 1887, is a U.S. Class I railroad. KCSR serves a
    ten-state region in the midwest and southeast regions of the
    United States and has the shortest north/south rail route
    between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the
    Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern
    de México, S.A de C.V. (“KCSM”). KCS previously
    owned this stock through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grupo
    KCSM, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as
    Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or
    Grupo TFM. Effective May 8, 2007, Grupo KCSM was merged
    into KCSM. Through its

50-year

Concession from the Mexican government (“the
    Concession”), which will expire in 2047 unless extended,
    KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad
    system and has as its core route the most strategic portion of
    the shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico City
    and Laredo, Texas. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal
    industrial cities and three of its major seaports. KCSM’s
    rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the United States
    and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, the largest
    rail freight interchange point between the United States and
    Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to control and
    operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas,
    which spans the Rio Grande River between the United States and
    Mexico.

The Company wholly owns, directly and indirectly, through its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”)
    which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex operates a

157-mile

rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of
    Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR
    with KCSM. Tex-Mex connects with KCSM at the United
    States/Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and connects to KCSR
    through trackage rights at Beaumont, Texas. Through its
    ownership of Mexrail, the Company owns the northern half of the
    rail bridge at Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal
    international gateway through which more than half of all rail
    and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico
    crosses the border. The Company also controls the southern half
    of this bridge through its ownership of KCSM.

The KCS rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex) comprises
    approximately 6,000 miles of main and branch lines
    extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United
    States south into Mexico and connects with other Class I
    railroads, providing shippers with an effective alternative to
    other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the
    southeast and southwest United States through less congested
    interchange hubs.

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC)”, a joint venture
    company owned equally by KCS and

Mi-Jack

Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession
    from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the
    Panama Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international container shipping companies with a railway
    transportation option in lieu of the Panama Canal. The
    concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of
    25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional
    25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south
    railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic
    and Pacific Oceans. PCRC’s subsidiary, Panarail Tourism
    Company (“Panarail”), operates and promotes commuter
    and tourist passenger service over the Panama Canal Railway.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy-six
    percent owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR
    rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport,
    Louisiana, which is the portion of the KCSR rail line between
    Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian
    Speedway.” Norfolk



Southern Corporation (“NS”) through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns
    the remaining twenty-four percent of MSLLC. Ultimately KCS will
    own seventy percent and NS will own thirty percent of MSLLC upon
    the contribution of additional capital by NS to MSLLC or its
    subsidiaries;

•

PABTEX GP, LLC, a wholly-owned and consolidated owner of a bulk
    materials handling facility with deep-water access to the Gulf
    of Mexico at Port Arthur, Texas that stores and transfers
    petroleum coke from rail cars to ships, primarily for export;

•

Trans-Serve, Inc. (doing business as Superior Tie and Timber), a
    wholly-owned and consolidated operator of a railroad wood tie
    treatment facility;

•

Transfin Insurance, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated
    captive insurance company, providing property, general liability
    and certain other insurance coverage to KCS and its subsidiaries
    and affiliates;

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that leases locomotives and rail equipment; and

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

MARKETS SERVED

Chemical and petroleum.

KCS transports chemical and petroleum products via tank and hopper cars to markets in the southeast and northeast United States and throughout Mexico through interchanges with other rail carriers. Primary traffic includes plastics, petroleum, oils, petroleum coke, rubber and miscellaneous chemicals.

Forest products and metals.

KCS’ rail lines run through the heart of the southeast United States timber-producing region. The Company believes that forest products made from trees in this

2007 Revenues

Business Mix

region are generally less expensive than those from other
    regions due to lower production costs. As a result, southern
    yellow pine products from the southeast are increasingly being
    used at the expense of western producers that have experienced
    capacity reductions because of public policy considerations.
    KCSR serves paper mills directly and indirectly through
    short-line connections.

This product category includes metals and ores such as iron,
    steel, zinc and copper. The majority of metals, minerals and
    ores mined, and steel produced in Mexico are used for domestic
    consumption. The volume of Mexican steel exports fluctuates
    based on global market prices. Higher-end finished products such
    as steel coils used by Mexican manufacturers in automobiles,
    household appliances and other consumer goods are imported
    through Nuevo Laredo and through the seaports served by
    KCS’ rail lines. United States slab steel products are used
    primarily in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry.

Agriculture and minerals.

Agriculture products
    consist of grain, food and related products. Shipper demand for
    agriculture products is affected by competition among sources of
    grain and grain products, as well as price fluctuations in
    international markets for key commodities. In the United States,
    KCS’ rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain
    and grain products for delivery to feed mills serving the
    poultry industry. KCS currently serves feed mills along its rail
    lines throughout Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana,
    Mississippi and Alabama. Through its marketing agreements, KCS
    has access to sources of corn and other grain in Iowa and other
    midwest states. United States export grain shipments and Mexico
    import grain shipments include primarily corn, wheat, and
    soybeans transported to Mexico via Laredo and to the Gulf of



Mexico for overseas destinations. Over the long term, export
    grain shipments to Mexico are expected to increase as a result
    of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports. Food and related
    products consist mainly of soybean meal, grain meal, oils,
    canned goods, sugar and beer. Mineral shipments consist of a
    variety of products including ores, clay, stone and cement.

Intermodal and automotive.

The intermodal
    freight business consists primarily of hauling freight
    containers or truck trailers on behalf of steamship lines, motor
    carriers, and intermodal marketing companies with rail carriers
    serving as long-distance haulers. KCS serves and supports the
    U.S. market, the Mexican market, as well as cross border
    traffic between the U.S. and Mexico. In light of the
    importance of trade between Asia and the U.S., the Company
    believes the port of Lázaro Cárdenas continues to
    become a strategically beneficial location for ocean carriers
    and big box retailers as current capacity increases and future
    capacity is developed. The Asia/U.S. commerce is handled
    through the port of Lázaro Cárdenas in conjunction
    with cross border movement on the KCS rail network. The
    automotive business consists primarily of moving parts to
    assembly plants and finished vehicles to distribution centers
    for market consumption in North and South America.

Coal.

KCS hauls unit trains of coal for nine
    electric generating plants in the central United States from the
    Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Coal mined in the midwest United
    States is transported in

non-unit

trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills and cement
    companies.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The Company’s United States operations are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations generally
    applicable to all businesses. Rail operations are also subject
    to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation
    Board (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of
    Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad
    Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and
    state regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over
    disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and
    services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications
    for line extensions and construction, and consolidation or
    merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers.
    DOT and OSHA each has jurisdiction under several federal
    statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
    operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials.
    State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with
    respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise regulated by
    federal law.

KCS’ subsidiaries, as well as its competitors, are subject
    to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations.
    These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic
    substances, and the generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.
    These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks
    and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental
    risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently
    involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican
    operations is overseen by the Secretary of Communications and
    Transportation (“SCT”). The SCT establishes
    regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and is
    responsible for resolving disputes between railways and between
    railways and customers. In addition, KCSM must register its
    maximum rates with the SCT and make regular reports to the SCT
    on investment and traffic volumes. See Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

“Description of the Business —

The KCSM
    Concession

.”

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the
    imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of
    operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or
    the termination of the Concession. KCS believes that all
    facilities which it operates are in substantial compliance with
    applicable



environmental laws, regulations and agency agreements. There are
    currently no material legal or administrative proceedings
    pending against the Company with respect to any environmental
    matters and management does not believe that continued
    compliance with environmental laws will have any material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. KCS
    cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified
    environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more
    stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition.

COMPETITION

The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are
    much larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources. Since 1994, there has been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. As a result, the
    railroad industry is now dominated by a few very large carriers.
    The larger western railroads (BNSF Railway Company and Union
    Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are significant
    competitors of KCS because of their substantial resources. The
    ongoing impact of past and future rail consolidation is
    uncertain. However, KCS believes that its investments and
    strategic alliances continue to competitively position the
    Company to attract additional rail traffic throughout its rail
    network.

In November 2005, Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Ferromex”) acquired control of and merged with
    Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”),
    creating Mexico’s largest railway. These merged operations
    are much larger than KCSM, and they serve most of the major
    ports and cities in Mexico and together own fifty percent of
    FTVM, which serves industries located within Mexico City. The
    merger between Ferromex and Ferrosur has been declared illegal
    by the

Comisión Federal de Competencia

(Mexican
    Antitrust Commission, or “COFECO”). Both Ferromex and
    Ferrosur have challenged this ruling.

The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge
    lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain
    routes in KCS’ operating areas. In the past, truck carriers
    have generally eroded the railroad industry’s share of
    total transportation revenues. Intermodal traffic and certain
    other traffic face highly price sensitive competition,
    particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers,
    including KCS, have placed an emphasis on competing in the
    intermodal marketplace and working with motor carriers to
    provide end-to-end transportation of products.

While deregulation of U.S. freight rates has enhanced the
    ability of railroads to compete with each other and with
    alternative modes of transportation, this increased competition
    has generally resulted in downward pressure on freight rates.
    Competition with other railroads and other modes of
    transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the
    quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality
    of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities.

EMPLOYEES
    AND LABOR RELATIONS

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
    to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s
    procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and
    the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted.
    Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take
    place over an extended period of time and the Company rarely
    experiences work stoppages during negotiations. Wages, health
    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have
    traditionally been addressed during these negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carrier’s Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees has been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated on November 1, 2004. Long
    term settlement agreements have been reached during 2007
    covering approximately 60% of KCSR’s unionized work force
    through January 1, 2010. The settlements have not had a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Negotiations continue with the two remaining unions
    representing the remaining KCSR union employees and are expected
    to conclude in 2008 under similar terms to the 2007 settlements.
    We do not



believe that the expected settlements in 2008 will have a
    material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997 between KCSM and the Sindicato
    de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana
    (Mexican Railroad Union), for a term of 50 years, for the
    purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties and
    improving conditions for the union employees. Approximately 80%
    of KCSM employees are covered by this labor agreement. The
    compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to
    renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms are
    renegotiated every two years. Compensation terms and other
    benefits are currently being renegotiated and KCSM expects to
    finalize these terms during the first quarter of 2008. The union
    labor negotiation with the Mexican Railroad Union has not
    historically resulted in any strike, boycott, or other
    disruption in KCSM’s business operations. KCSM anticipates
    that the expected settlements in 2008 will not have a material
    impact to the consolidated financial statements.

The response to Item 101 of

Regulation S-K

under Part II Item 7 of this

Form 10-K,

and the responses under Note 1 and Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

are incorporated by reference in partial response to this
    Item 1. Refer to Item 2, “Properties”, for
    further discussion of the Company’s business.

RAIL
    SECURITY

The Company and its rail subsidiaries have made a concentrated,
    multi-disciplinary effort since the terrorist attacks on the
    United States on September 11, 2001, to continue securing
    the Company’s assets and personnel against the risk of
    terrorism and other homeland security incidents. Many of the
    specific measures the Company utilizes for these efforts are
    required to be kept confidential through arrangements with
    government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security
    (“DHS”), or through jointly-developed and implemented
    strategies and plans with connecting carriers. To protect the
    confidentiality and sensitivity of the efforts the Company has
    made to safeguard against terrorism and other security
    incidents, the following paragraphs will provide only a general
    overview of some of these efforts. KCSR utilizes a security plan
    based on an industry-wide security plan developed by Association
    of American Railroads (“AAR”) members which focuses on
    comprehensive risk assessments in five areas —
    hazardous materials; train operations; critical physical assets;
    military traffic; and information technology and communications.
    The security plan is kept confidential, with access to the plan
    tightly limited to members of management with direct security
    and anti-terrorism implementation responsibilities. KCSR
    participates with other AAR members in periodic drills under the
    industry plan to test and refine its various provisions.

KCSR’s security activities range from annually mailing each
    employee a security awareness brochure to its ongoing
    development and implementation of security plans for rail
    facilities in areas labeled by the DHS as High Threat Urban
    Areas (“HTUAs”). KCSR’s other activities to
    bolster security against terrorism include, but are not limited
    to, the following:

•

Conferring regularly with other railroads’ security
    personnel and with industry experts on security issues;

•

Analyzing routing alternatives and other strategies to reduce
    the distances that certain chemicals which might be toxic if
    inhaled are transported;

•

Initiating a series of over 20 voluntary action items agreed to
    between AAR and DHS as enhancing security in the rail
    industry; and

•

Including periodic security training as part of the scheduled
    training for operating employees and managers.

In addition, the Company recently created a new leadership role
    titled “Director of Homeland Security” to oversee the
    ongoing and increasingly complex security efforts of the Company
    in both the United States and Mexico. The Company identified and
    retained an individual to fill the position who has an extensive
    law enforcement background, including being formerly employed as
    an analyst with the Federal Bureau of



Investigation (“FBI”) for the past 12 years. This
    member of management remains a member of the FBI’s Joint
    Terrorism Task Force and is a valuable asset to the Company in
    implementing and developing anti-terrorism and other security
    initiatives.

During 2008, KCSR intends to work toward implementation of
    DHS’s Transport Worker Identification Card program for
    those employees requiring unescorted access to secure areas of
    port facilities, and toward implementation of a contractor
    background check program for contractor employees having access
    to certain Company facilities.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Related to an Investment in KCS’ Common Stock

The
    price of KCS’ common stock may fluctuate significantly,
    which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock
    when they want to or at prices they find
    attractive.

The price of KCS’ common stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange (“NYSE”), listed under the ticker symbol
    “KSU”, constantly changes. The Company expects that
    the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can fluctuate as a result of a
    variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCS’ control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

quarterly variations in operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management,
    securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts, ratings
    agencies and investors;

•

developments generally affecting the railroad industry;

•

announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant
    contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint
    ventures or capital commitments;

•

the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings
    against KCS;

•

KCS’ dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of
    dividends;

•

future sales of KCS’ equity or equity-linked securities;

•

the issuance of common stock in payment of dividends on
    preferred stock or upon conversion of preferred stock; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions.



In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has
    experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to
    the operating performance of a particular company. These broad
    market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS’
    ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock is currently
    restricted, and KCS does not anticipate paying cash dividends on
    its common stock in the foreseeable future.

KCS has agreed, and may agree in the future, to restrictions on
    its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock. In
    addition, to maintain its credit ratings, the Company may be
    limited in its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock
    so that it can maintain an appropriate level of debt. During the
    first quarter of 2000, the Board of Directors suspended common
    stock dividends. KCS does not anticipate making any cash
    dividend payments to its common stockholders for the foreseeable
    future.

Holders
    of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
    Stock may have special voting rights if KCS fails to pay
    dividends on that preferred stock over a stated number of
    quarters.

Because of certain restrictions in the indentures governing
    notes issued by KCSR, KCS did not pay dividends on its
    Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock
    commencing on May 15, 2006, for the first quarter of 2006,
    until those dividend arrearages were made up in February 2007.
    If dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or
    Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears for six consecutive
    quarters (or an equivalent number of days in the aggregate,
    whether or not consecutive) holders of the Series C
    Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable,
    will be entitled to elect two of the authorized number of
    directors at the next annual stockholders’ meeting at which
    directors are elected and at each subsequent stockholders’
    meeting until such time as all accumulated dividends are paid on
    the Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred
    Stock, as applicable, or set aside for payment. In addition, KCS
    will not be eligible to register future offerings of securities
    on

Form S-3

or to avail itself of the other benefits available to companies
    that qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” under
    SEC rules if KCS fails to pay dividends on its preferred stock.
    If that happens it could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    access capital markets, and increase the cost of accessing
    capital markets, until the Company again qualifies as a
    “well-known seasoned issuer.”

Sales
    of substantial amounts of KCS’ common stock in the public
    market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the
    common stock.

As of December 31, 2007, there were 10,284,625 shares
    of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and
    the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 2,087,602 shares of
    common stock held by executive officers and directors outside
    those plans, and 20,389,113 shares of common stock reserved
    for issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of
    convertible preferred stock. Sales of common stock by employees
    upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and
    directors subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act, and sales of common stock that may be issued
    upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the
    perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the
    market price of KCS’ common stock.

KCS
    has provisions in its charter, bylaws and Rights Agreement that
    could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a
    controlling interest in KCS and that could deprive an investor
    of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or
    prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. These
    provisions may deprive KCS’ stockholders of an opportunity
    to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.
    For example, the restated certificate of incorporation provides
    for a classified Board of Directors. It further provides that
    the vote of 70% of the shares entitled to vote in the election
    of directors is required to amend the restated certificate of
    incorporation to increase the number of directors to more than
    eighteen, abolish cumulative voting for directors and abolish
    the classification of the board. The same vote requirement is
    imposed by the restated certificate of incorporation on certain
    transactions involving mergers, consolidations, sales or leases
    of assets with or to certain owners of more than 5% of KCS’
    outstanding stock entitled to vote in the election of directors.
    The bylaws provide that a stockholder must give



the Company advance written notice of its intent to nominate a
    director or raise a matter at an annual meeting. In addition,
    the Company has adopted a Rights Agreement which under certain
    circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third
    parties to acquire control of KCS without prior approval of the
    Board of Directors.

Risks
    Related to KCS’ Business

KCS
    competes against other railroads and other transportation
    providers.

The Company’s domestic and international operations are
    subject to competition from other railroads, in particular the
    Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) and BNSF Railway
    Company (“BNSF”) in the United States and
    Ferromex in Mexico. Many of KCS’ rail competitors are much
    larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources than KCS. In addition, the Company is subject to
    competition from truck carriers and from barge lines and other
    maritime shipping. Increased competition could result in
    downward pressure on freight rates. Competition with other
    railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based
    on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service
    provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for
    certain commodities. While KCS must build or acquire and
    maintain its infrastructure, truck carriers, maritime shippers
    and barges are able to use public rights-of-way. The trucking
    industry provides rate and service competition to the railroad
    industry. Trucking requires substantially smaller capital
    investment and maintenance expenditures than railroads and
    allows for more frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing
    competitive pressures, any reduction in margins due to
    competitive pressures, future improvements that increase the
    quality of alternative modes of transportation in the locations
    in which the Company operates, or legislation or regulations
    that provide motor carriers with additional advantages, such as
    increased size of vehicles and reduced weight restrictions,
    could have a material adverse effect on results of operations,
    financial condition and liquidity.

A central part of KCS’ growth strategy is based upon the
    conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance
    the Company will have the ability to convert traffic from truck
    to rail transport or that the customers already converted will
    be retained. If the railroad industry in general, and the
    Mexican operations in particular, are unable to preserve their
    competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry,
    projected revenue growth from the Mexican operations could be
    adversely affected. Additionally, the revenue growth
    attributable to the Mexican operations could be affected by,
    among other factors, KCS’ inability to grow its existing
    customer base and capture additional cargo transport market
    share because of competition from the shipping industry and
    other railroads.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”)
    called for Mexican trucks to have unrestricted access to
    highways in United States border states by 1995 and full access
    to all United States highways by January 2000. However, the
    United States did not follow that timetable because of concerns
    over Mexico’s trucking safety standards. In February 2001,
    a NAFTA tribunal ruled in arbitration between the United States
    and Mexico that the United States must allow Mexican trucks to
    cross the border and operate on United States highways. On
    March 14, 2002, as part of its agreement under NAFTA, the
    U.S. Department of Transportation issued safety rules that
    allow Mexican truckers to apply for operating authority to
    transport goods beyond the

20-mile

commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border. These
    safety rules require Mexican motor carriers seeking to operate
    in the United States to, among other things, pass safety
    inspections, obtain valid insurance with a United States
    registered insurance company, conduct alcohol and drug testing
    for drivers and obtain a U.S. Department of Transportation
    identification number. Under the rules issued by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation, it was expected that the
    border would have been opened to Mexican motor carriers in 2002.
    However, in January 2003, in response to a lawsuit filed in May
    2002 by a coalition of environmental, consumer and labor groups,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a
    ruling which held that the rules issued by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation violated federal
    environmental laws because the Department of Transportation
    failed to adequately review the impact on United States air
    quality of rules allowing Mexican carriers to transport beyond
    the

20-mile

commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border. The
    Court of Appeals ruling required the Department of
    Transportation to provide an Environmental Impact Statement on
    the Mexican truck plan and to certify compliance with the United
    States Clean Air Act. The Department of Transportation requested
    the United States Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals



ruling and, on December 15, 2003, the Supreme Court granted
    the Department of Transportation’s request. On June 7,
    2004, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Court of
    Appeals ruling. The Department of Transportation is in the midst
    of a pilot program which commenced in early 2007 granting a
    limited number of Mexican trucking companies the right to
    operate on international movements between the
    United States and Mexico and to pick up or deliver outside
    of the border commercial zone. There can be no assurance that
    truck transport between Mexico and the United States will not
    increase substantially in the future. Any such increase in truck
    traffic could affect KCS’ ability to continue converting
    traffic to rail from truck transport because it may result in an
    expansion in the availability, or an improvement in the quality,
    of the trucking services offered by Mexican carriers.

Through KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government, the
    Company has the right to control and operate the southern half
    of the rail-bridge at Laredo, Texas. Under the Concession, KCSM
    must grant to Ferromex the right to operate over a north-south
    portion of KCSM’s rail lines between Ramos Arizpe near
    Monterrey and the city of Queretaro that constitutes over 600
    kilometers (360 miles) of KCSM’s main track. Using
    these trackage rights, Ferromex may be able to compete with KCSM
    over KCSM’s rail lines for traffic between Mexico City and
    the United States. The Concession also requires KCSM to grant
    rights to use certain portions of its tracks to Ferrosur and the
    “belt railroad” operated in the greater Mexico City
    area by FTVM, thereby providing Ferrosur with more efficient
    access to certain Mexico City industries. As a result of having
    to grant trackage rights to other railroads, KCSM loses the
    capacity of using a portion of its tracks at all times.

Ferromex, the operator of the largest railway system in Mexico,
    is in close proximity to KCSM’s rail lines. KCSM has
    experienced and continues to experience competition from
    Ferromex with respect to the transport of a variety of products.
    The rail lines operated by Ferromex run from Guadalajara and
    Mexico City to four United States border crossings west of the
    Nuevo Laredo-Laredo crossing, providing an alternative to
    KCSM’s routes for the transport of freight from those
    cities to the United States border. In addition, Ferromex
    directly competes with KCSM in some areas of its service
    territory, including Tampico, Saltillo, Monterrey, and Mexico
    City. Ferrosur competes directly with KCSM for traffic to and
    from southeastern Mexico. Ferrosur, like KCSM, also services
    Mexico City and Puebla.

In November 2005, Grupo México, the controlling shareholder
    of Ferromex, acquired all of the shares of Ferrosur. The common
    control of Ferromex and Ferrosur would give Grupo México
    control over a nationwide railway system in Mexico and ownership
    of 50% of the shares of FTVM. The merger between Ferromex and
    Ferrosur has been declared illegal by the Mexican Antitrust
    Commission. Both Ferromex and Ferrosur have challenged this
    ruling. There can be no assurance as to whether Grupo
    México will be successful in challenging this ruling. If
    Grupo México is successful in its appeal, KCSM’s
    competitive position may be materially harmed.

On August 3, 2006, COFECO announced an investigation into
    possible antitrust practices in the provision of rail cargo
    services. The targets of that investigation have not been
    identified, and while KCSM may be required to provide
    information in connection with the investigation, the Company
    does not believe KCSM’s operations are the subject of the
    inquiry, however there can be no assurance KCSM is not or will
    not become a subject of the inquiry.

Rate reductions by competitors could make KCS’ freight
    services less competitive and KCS cannot assure that it would
    always be able to match these rate reductions. In recent years,
    KCS has experienced aggressive price competition from Ferromex
    in freight rates for agriculture products, which has adversely
    affected results of operations. KCS’ ability to respond to
    competitive pressures by decreasing rates without adversely
    affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on,
    among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs.
    KCS’ failure to respond to competitive pressures, and
    particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operation and financial condition.

In recent years, there has also been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. The resulting merged
    railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to
    block other railroads’ access to efficient gateways and
    routing options that are currently and have been historically
    available. There



can be no assurance that further consolidation in the railroad
    industry, whether in the United States or Mexico, will not have
    an adverse effect on operations.

KCS’
    business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on
    agreements with other railroads and third parties.

Operation of KCS’ rail network and its plans for growth and
    expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads
    and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic
    alliances. KCS’ operations are dependent on interchange,
    trackage rights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with
    other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange
    traffic and utilize trackage the Company does not own. KCS’
    ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers
    depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these
    agreements with other railroads and third parties. The
    termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could
    adversely affect KCS’ business, financial condition and
    results of operations. KCS is also dependent in part upon the
    financial health and efficient performance of other railroads.
    For example, some of KCSR’s traffic moves over the
    UP’s lines via trackage rights, a significant portion of
    KCSR’s grain shipments originate with another rail carrier
    pursuant to marketing agreements with that carrier, and BNSF is
    KCS’ largest partner in the interchange of rail traffic.
    There can be no assurance that KCS will not be materially
    adversely affected by operational or financial difficulties of
    other railroads.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
    Ferromex, Ferrosur, and FTVM to use portions of KCSM’s
    tracks. Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex, Ferrosur and
    FTVM are required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of
    their tracks. KCSM’s Concession classifies trackage rights
    as short trackage rights and long-distance trackage rights.
    Although all of these trackage rights have been granted under
    the Concession, no railroad has actually operated under the
    long-distance trackage rights because the means of setting rates
    for usage and often related terms of usage have not been agreed
    upon. Under the Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations,
    the rates KCSM may charge for the right to use its tracks must
    be agreed upon in writing between KCSM and the party to which
    those rights are granted. However, if KCSM cannot reach an
    agreement on rates with rail carriers entitled to trackage
    rights on KCSM’s rail lines, the SCT is entitled to set the
    rates in accordance with Mexican law and regulation, which rates
    may not adequately compensate KCSM. KCSM has not been able to
    reach an agreement with Ferromex regarding the rates to be
    charged for trackage rights, interline services and haulage
    rights. KCSM and Ferromex are involved in judicial, civil and
    commercial litigation and administrative proceedings over the
    amounts payable to each other for interline services, haulage
    and trackage rights. Some of those disputes continue under
    litigation and therefore are pending final resolution. Any
    resolution of such procedures adverse to KCSM could have a
    negative impact on its business and operations. In March 2002,
    the SCT issued a ruling setting the rates for trackage and
    haulage rights. In August 2002, the SCT issued a ruling setting
    the rates for interline and terminal services. KCSM and Ferromex
    appealed both rulings. Following trial and appellate court
    decisions, the Mexican Supreme Court in February 2006, in a
    ruling from the bench, sustained KCSM’s appeal of the
    SCT’s trackage and haulage rights ruling, vacating the SCT
    ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent
    with the Court’s decision. KCSM has not yet received the
    written opinion of the Mexican Supreme Court decision, nor has
    the Mexican Supreme Court decided the interline and terminal
    services appeal. In October 2006, KCSM was served with a claim
    by Ferromex, in which Ferromex asked for information concerning
    the interline traffic between KCSM and Ferromex, from January
    2002 to December 2004. The 29th Civil Court issued an order
    directing KCSM to allow Ferromex to review certain account logs.
    KCSM appealed such order to the 1st Civil District Court
    and is awaiting a decision. KCSM expects this litigation to
    continue over the next few years. The Company believes that,
    based on its assessment of the facts in this case, there will be
    no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

KCSM and Ferromex are parties to various civil cases involving
    disputes over the application and proper interpretation of the
    mandatory trackage rights. In August 2002, the SCT issued
    rulings determining Ferromex’s trackage rights in
    Monterrey, Nuevo León. KCSM and Ferromex both appealed the
    SCT’s rulings. At the Mexican Administrative Federal Court
    level, KCSM obtained what it believed were favorable rulings in
    April 2005. Ferromex appealed these rulings and the case was
    returned to the Mexican Administrative Federal Court. The
    Mexican Administrative Federal Court issued a ruling on
    June 11, 2007, which was served on



KCSM on August 8, 2007. In the ruling, the Mexican
    Administrative Federal Court reversed the earlier favorable
    ruling and decided that Ferromex could use certain auxiliary
    tracks awarded to KCSM in its Concession. KCSM appealed this
    ruling at the beginning of September 2007, arguing that the
    Mexican Administrative Federal Court wrongly failed to consider
    the earlier favorable decision in making its revised ruling and
    also failed to consider the length and limits of the trackage
    rights included in KCSM’s Concession Title. The Company
    believes that based on its assessment of the facts in this case,
    there will be no material impact to the consolidated financial
    statements.

KCS’
    debt capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage of total
    debt plus equity) is 50.4%. KCS’ leverage could adversely
    affect its ability to fulfill obligations under various debt
    instruments and operate its business.

KCS’ level of debt could make it more difficult for it to
    borrow money in the future, may reduce the amount of money
    available to finance operations and other business activities,
    exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates,
    makes it more vulnerable to general economic downturns and
    adverse industry conditions, and could reduce flexibility in
    planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic
    conditions. KCS’ failure to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants in its debt instruments, which,
    among other things, require KCS to maintain specified financial
    ratios and limit its ability to incur debt and sell assets,
    could result in an event of default that, if not cured or
    waived, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not
    have enough cash to service its debt, meet other obligations and
    fund other liquidity needs, KCS may be required to take actions
    such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying
    capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or
    refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking
    additional equity capital. KCS cannot assure that any of these
    remedies can be affected on commercially reasonable terms or at
    all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt
    agreements may restrict the Company from adopting some of these
    alternatives.

The indebtedness of KCSM exposes it to risks of exchange rate
    fluctuations because any devaluation of the peso would cause the
    cost of KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase and
    could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico,
    compared to Mexican competitors that have less debt and greater
    operating and financing flexibility than KCSM does.

KCS’
    business is capital intensive.

The Company’s business is capital intensive and requires
    substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things,
    additions and improvements to roadway, structures and
    technology, acquisitions, and maintenance and repair of
    equipment and the rail system. KCS’ failure to make
    necessary capital expenditures to maintain its operations could
    impair its ability to serve existing customers or accommodate
    increases in traffic volumes.

KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund, capital
    expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, equipment
    leases, debt financing and, to a lesser extent, vendor
    financing. KCS may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows
    from its operations or obtain sufficient funds from external
    sources to fund capital expenditure requirements. Even if
    financing is available, it may not be obtainable on acceptable
    terms and within the limitations contained in the indentures and
    other agreements relating to KCS’ debt.

KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM
    fails to make such capital investments, KCSM’s business
    plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk,
    requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no
    assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by
    the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business
    plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not
    grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with
    the capital investment commitments in its business plan could
    result in sanctions imposed by the SCT, and could result in
    revocation of the Concession if sanctions are imposed on five
    distinct occasions. The Company cannot assure that the Mexican
    government would grant any such permission or waiver. If such
    permission or waiver is not obtained in any instance and KCSM is
    sanctioned, its Concession might be at risk of revocation, which
    would materially adversely affect KCS’ financial



condition and results of operations. See “KCSM’s
    Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances” below.

KCS’
    business may be adversely affected by changes in general
    economic, weather or other conditions.

KCS’ operations may be adversely affected by changes in the
    economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that
    produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The
    relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican
    economies affect the businesses served by KCS. PCRC and Panarail
    are directly affected by the Panamanian local economy and
    trans-Pacific trade flows. KCS’ investments in Mexico and
    Panama expose the Company to risks associated with operating in
    Mexico and Panama, including, among others, cultural
    differences, varying labor, regulatory and operating practices,
    political risk and differences between the United States,
    Mexican and Panamanian economies. Historically, a stronger
    economy has resulted in improved results for KCS’ rail
    transportation operations. Conversely, when the economy has
    slowed, results have been less favorable. If an economic
    slowdown or recession occurs in key markets, the volume of rail
    shipments is likely to be reduced, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

The Company’s operations may also be affected by natural
    disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in
    and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, and its
    facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and
    other extreme weather conditions. For example, hurricanes have
    adversely affected some of the Company’s shippers located
    along the Gulf Coast and caused interruptions in the flow of
    traffic within the southern United States and between the United
    States and Mexico. As another example, a weak harvest in the
    midwest may substantially reduce the volume of business handled
    for agricultural products customers. Many of the goods and
    commodities transported experience cyclical demand. KCS’
    results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclical
    demand because of the significant fixed costs inherent in
    railroad operations. Significant reductions in the volume of
    rail shipments due to economic, weather, or other conditions
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business,
    financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally
    tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although
    transportation markets are affected by general economic
    conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each
    particular market segment that may influence operating results.
    Some of KCS’ customers do business in industries that are
    highly cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive, housing
    and agriculture industries. Any downturn in these industries
    could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also,
    some of the products transported have had a historical pattern
    of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the
    general economic environment and by industry capacity and
    demand. For example, global steel and petrochemical prices have
    decreased in the past. KCS cannot assure that prices and demand
    for these products will not decline in the future, adversely
    affecting those industries and, in turn, the Company’s
    financial condition or results.

KCS’
    business is subject to regulation by international, federal,
    state and local regulatory agencies. KCS’ failure to comply
    with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on
    its operations.

KCS is subject to governmental regulation by international,
    federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to its
    railroad operations, as well as a variety of health, safety,
    labor, environmental, and other matters. Government regulation
    of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the
    competitiveness and profitability of railroads. KCS’
    failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could
    have a material adverse effect on operations, including
    limitations on operating activities until compliance with
    applicable requirements is achieved. These government agencies
    may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which
    the Company operates without providing any recourse for any
    adverse effects on its business that occur as a result of such
    change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to
    obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other
    authorizations. Any failure to maintain these licenses, permits,
    and other authorizations could adversely affect our business.



KCS’
    business is subject to environmental, health, and safety laws
    and regulations that could require KCS to incur material costs
    or liabilities relating to environmental, health, or safety
    compliance or remediation.

KCS’ operations are subject to extensive international,
    federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws
    and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the
    air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation
    and disposal of waste and other materials, the cleanup of
    hazardous material or petroleum releases, decommissioning of
    underground storage tanks and noise pollution. Violations of
    these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties,
    permit revocations, facility shutdowns and other civil and
    criminal sanctions. From time to time, certain KCS facilities
    have not been in compliance with environmental, health and
    safety laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that
    KCS will always be in compliance with such laws and regulations
    in the future. The Company incurs, and expects to continue to
    incur, environmental compliance costs, including, in particular,
    costs necessary to maintain compliance with requirements
    governing chemical and hazardous material shipping operations,
    refueling operations and repair facilities. New laws and
    regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, new
    spills, releases or violations or the discovery of previously
    unknown contamination could require KCS to incur costs or
    subject KCS to liabilities that could have a material adverse
    effect on KCS’ business, results of operations, financial
    condition, and cash flows.

In the operation of a railroad, it is possible that derailments,
    explosions, or other accidents may occur that could cause harm
    to the environment or to human life or health. As a result, KCS
    may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address
    any such harm, including costs relating to the performance of

clean-ups,

natural resources damages and compensatory or punitive damages
    for harm to property or individuals.

The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
    and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”)
    and similar state laws (known as “Superfund laws”)
    impose liability for the cost of remedial or removal actions,
    natural resources damages and related costs at certain sites
    identified as posing a threat to the environment or public
    health. CERCLA imposes joint, strict and several liabilities on
    the owners and operators of facilities in which hazardous waste
    and other hazardous substances are deposited or from which they
    are released or are likely to be released into the environment.
    Liability may be imposed, without regard to fault or the
    legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons,
    including the current and certain prior owners or operators of a
    site where hazardous substances have been released and persons
    that arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
    substances. In addition, other potentially responsible parties,
    adjacent landowners or other third parties may initiate cost
    recovery actions or toxic tort litigation against sites subject
    to CERCLA or similar state laws. Given the nature of its
    business, KCS presently has environmental investigation and
    remediation obligations at certain sites, including a former
    foundry site in Alexandria, Louisiana, and will likely incur
    such obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities
    accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s
    best estimate of the probable future obligation for the
    remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded
    liability is the best estimate of all probable costs,

clean-up

costs cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and may
    exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving
    environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the
    extent of other parties’ participation, developments in
    environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective
    action that may ultimately be required.

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment. The primary environmental law in Mexico is the
    General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection
    (the “Ecological Law”). The Mexican federal agency in
    charge of overseeing compliance with and enforcement of the
    Ecological Law is the Ministry of Environmental Protection and
    Natural Resources (“Semarnat”). The regulations issued
    under the Ecological Law and technical environmental
    requirements issued by Semarnat have promulgated standards for,
    among other things, water discharge, water supply, emissions,
    noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and
    handling of hazardous and solid waste. As part of its
    enforcement powers, Semarnat is empowered to bring
    administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic
    sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws and
    temporarily, or even permanently, close non-complying
    facilities. KCSM is also subject to the laws of



various jurisdictions and international conferences with respect
    to the discharge of materials into the environment and to
    environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments of
    each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities are
    located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican
    government also impose environmental compliance obligations on
    KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that
    unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional
    or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have
    on KCSM’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition. Failure to comply with any such environmental laws or
    regulations may result in the termination of KCSM’s
    Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect
    profitability.

KCSR
    has been named as a defendant in several putative class action
    lawsuits that may divert management’s attention from the
    Company’s business, cause the Company to incur substantial
    expenses, and in the event of an adverse result expose the
    Company to significant damages and penalties.

As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

as of December 31, 2007, KCSR has been included along with
    several other major U.S. railroads in 28 putative class
    actions alleging that the individual railroads conspired to fix
    fuel surcharges in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. While
    the Company believes these price fixing allegations have no
    merit and intends to vigorously defend these claims, no
    assurance can be given regarding the outcomes of these lawsuits.
    These and related matters have required, and will continue to
    require, the Company to incur substantial expenses for legal and
    other professional services. If the Company is found liable in
    these proceedings, it could be required to pay damages (possibly
    including treble damages) and penalties and might face
    additional remedies that could harm its financial condition and
    operating results.

KCS’
    business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and disruptions in
    fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the cost of fuel that
    is not adequately covered by fuel surcharges, or severe
    disruption of fuel supplies, would have a material adverse
    effect on KCS’ business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and
    these costs represent a significant portion of its
    transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel
    may have a material adverse effect on operating results. Fuel
    expense increased from 19% of consolidated operating costs
    during 2006 to 20% of consolidated operating costs during 2007.
    KCS has been able to pass the majority of these fuel cost
    increases on to customers in the form of fuel surcharges applied
    either in the form of an increase in the freight rate or direct
    customer billings. If KCS is unable to recapture its costs of
    fuel from its customers, operating results could be materially
    adversely affected.

Fuel costs are affected by traffic levels, efficiency of
    operations and equipment, and petroleum market conditions. The
    supply and cost of fuel are subject to market conditions and are
    influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company’s
    control, including general economic conditions, world markets,
    government programs and regulations, and competition. In
    addition, instability in the Middle East and interruptions in
    domestic production and refining due to hurricane damage may
    result in an increase in fuel prices. Fuel prices and supplies
    could also be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply, any
    interruptions in refining operations or by any imposition of
    mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. In the event of a
    severe disruption of fuel supplies resulting from supply
    shortages, political unrest, a disruption of oil imports,
    weather events, war, or otherwise, the resulting impact on fuel
    prices could materially adversely affect KCS’ operating
    results, financial condition, and cash flows.

KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel
    requirements for its Mexican operations almost exclusively
    through purchases at market prices from PEMEX Refinanción
    (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico, a
    government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the
    distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to
    a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration. Either
    party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written
    notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is
    terminated and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from
    alternate sources on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations
    could be materially adversely affected.



The
    loss of key personnel could negatively affect
    business.

KCS’ success substantially depends on its ability to
    attract and retain key members of the senior management team and
    the principals of its foreign subsidiaries. Recruiting,
    motivating, and retaining qualified management personnel,
    particularly those with expertise in the railroad industry, are
    vital to operations and success. There is substantial
    competition for qualified management personnel and there can be
    no assurance that KCS will always be able to attract or retain
    qualified personnel. Employment agreements with senior
    management are terminable at any time by either party. If KCS
    loses one or more of these key executives or principals, its
    ability to successfully implement its business plans and the
    value of its common stock could be materially adversely affected.

A
    majority of KCS’ employees belong to labor unions. Strikes
    or work stoppages could adversely affect
    operations.

The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with
    various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of
    December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of KCSR employees and
    approximately 80% of KCSM employees were covered by labor
    contracts subject to collective bargaining. The Company may be
    subject to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or work
    slowdowns as a result of disputes under these collective
    bargaining agreements and labor contracts or KCS’ potential
    inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions.
    In the United States, because such agreements are generally
    negotiated on an industry-wide basis, determination of the terms
    and conditions of labor agreements have been and could continue
    to be beyond KCS’ control. KCS may, therefore, be subject
    to terms and conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that
    could have a material adverse affect on its results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows. If the unionized
    workers in the United States or Mexico were to engage in a
    strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, if other employees were
    to become unionized, or if the terms and conditions in future
    labor agreements were renegotiated, KCS could experience a
    significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing
    labor costs. Although the U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes
    restrictions on the right of United States railway workers to
    strike, there is no law in Mexico imposing similar restrictions
    on the right of railway workers in that country to strike.

KCS
    faces possible catastrophic loss and liability and its insurance
    may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages to
    others.

The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk
    of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision, and property
    loss. In the course of KCS’ operations, spills or other
    environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business
    interruption due to political developments, as well as labor
    disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result
    in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs.
    Collisions, environmental mishaps, or other accidents can cause
    serious bodily injury, death, and extensive property damage,
    particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated
    areas. Additionally, KCS’ operations may be affected from
    time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes,
    volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of
    a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ operations and financial condition. The Company
    maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice
    against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of
    its business and business interruption due to natural disaster.
    However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on
    coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against.
    This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCS’ damages
    or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be
    available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance,
    if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, KCS may not
    be able to restore service without a significant interruption to
    operations which could have an adverse effect on KCS’
    financial condition.

KCS’
    business may be affected by future acts of terrorism or
    war.

Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s
    chemical transportation activities, any government response
    thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
    These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise
    capital or its future business opportunities. KCS’ rail
    lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect
    casualties of acts of terror, which



could cause significant business interruption and result in
    increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In
    addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the
    terrorism coverage currently maintained by KCS could increase
    dramatically or certain coverage may not be available in the
    future.

KCSM’s
    Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating
    its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business and financial condition.

KCSM operates under a

50-year

Concession granted by the Mexican government. The Concession
    gives KCSM exclusive rights to provide freight transportation
    services over its rail lines for 30 years of the

50-year

Concession, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights
    granted to other concessionaires. The SCT is principally
    responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico. The SCT
    has broad powers to monitor KCSM’s compliance with the
    Concession and it can require KCSM to supply it with any
    technical, administrative and financial information it requests.
    Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment
    commitments established in its business plan, which forms an
    integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every
    five years. The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans
    confidentially. The SCT also monitors KCSM’s compliance
    with efficiency and safety standards established in the
    Concession. The SCT reviews, and may amend, these standards
    every five years.

The Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide the
    Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM
    under the Concession, including the right to take over the
    management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary
    cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the
    past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to
    other privatized industries, including the telecommunications
    industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In
    addition, under the Concession and the Mexican Railroad Services
    Law and regulations, the SCT, in consultation with the Mexican
    Antitrust Commission, reserves the right to set tariffs if it
    determines that effective competition does not exist in the
    Mexican railroad industry. The Mexican Antitrust Commission,
    however, has not published guidelines regarding the factors that
    constitute a lack of competition. It is therefore unclear under
    what particular circumstances the Mexican Antitrust Commission
    would deem a lack of competition to exist. If the SCT intervenes
    and sets tariffs, the rates it sets may be too low to allow KCSM
    to operate profitably.

The Concession is renewable for up to 50 years, subject to
    certain conditions. The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is
    sanctioned on three distinct occasions if KCSM unjustly
    interrupts the operation of its rail lines or if KCSM charges
    tariffs higher than the tariffs it has registered with the SCT.
    In addition, the SCT may revoke the Concession if, among other
    things, KCSM is sanctioned on five distinct occasions because
    KCSM restricts the ability of other Mexican rail operators to
    use its rail lines; KCSM fails to make payments for damages
    caused during the performance of services; KCSM fails to comply
    with any term or condition of the Mexican railroad services law
    and regulations or the Concession; KCSM fails to make the
    capital investments required under its five-year business plan
    filed with the SCT; or KCSM fails to maintain an obligations
    compliance bond and insurance coverage as specified in the
    Mexican railroad services law and regulations. In addition, the
    Concession would revoke automatically if KCSM changes its
    nationality or assigns or creates any lien on the Concession, or
    if there is a change in control of KCSM, without the SCT’s
    approval. The SCT may also terminate the Concession as a result
    of KCSM’s surrender of its rights under the Concession, or
    for reasons of public interest or upon KCSM’s liquidation
    or bankruptcy. Revocation or termination of the Concession would
    prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would materially
    adversely affect the Mexican operations and the ability to make
    payments on KCSM’s debt. If the Concession is terminated or
    revoked by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no
    compensation and its interest in its rail lines and all other
    fixtures covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements
    made by it, would revert to the Mexican government.

In April 2006, the SCT initiated a proceeding against KCSM,
    claiming that KCSM had failed to make certain minimum capital
    investments projected for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year
    business plan filed with the SCT prior to its acquisition by
    KCS. KCSM believes it made capital expenditures exceeding the
    required amounts. KCSM responded to the SCT by providing
    evidence in support of its investments and explaining why it
    believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May 2007, the Company
    was served with an SCT resolution



regarding the sanction proceeding for 2004. In June 2007, KCSM
    was served with an SCT notification that KCSM failed to make
    minimum capital investments for 2004 and 2005. The SCT imposed a
    fine in the amount of Ps.46,800. On August 16, 2007, KCSM
    filed a nullity claim against the 2004 investment plan
    resolution issued by the SCT, and on August 20, 2007, filed
    a nullity claim against the 2005 plan resolution, both before
    the Mexican Administrative Federal Court. If necessary, KCSM
    will have the right to appeal any adverse ruling by the Mexican
    Administrative Federal Court before the Mexican Federal
    Magistrates Tribunal. KCSM believes that even if the threatened
    sanctions become effective, there will be no material adverse
    effect on the operations of KCSM. However, if these proceedings
    are conclusively ruled adversely against KCSM and sanctions are
    imposed, KCSM could be subject to possible future revocation of
    its Concession if the SCT imposes sanctions on five distinct
    occasions for the same failure over the remaining term of the
    Concession.

Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail
    lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated
    structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the
    Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain
    assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. All
    other property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it
    for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will also have a right of first refusal with respect
    to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after revocation of the Concession.

The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of
    KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger
    to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may
    restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in such
    manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but
    only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican
    law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it
    effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public
    interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause
    other than international war, the Mexican Railroad Services Law
    and regulations provide that the Mexican government will
    indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to
    damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may
    not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not
    be timely made.

KCS’
    ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to
    economic and political risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise,
    significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly,
    Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and
    state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on
    Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSM’s
    Mexican operations in particular. The national elections held on
    July 2, 2000, ended 71 years of rule by the
    Institutional Revolutionary Party and resulted in the increased
    representation of opposition parties in the Mexican Congress and
    in mayoral and gubernatorial positions. In 2006 the presidential
    and federal congressional elections in Mexico were held and
    after a close presidential race Felipe Calderón was elected
    Mexico’s president. Calderón is from the same
    political party as his predecessor, Vicente Fox. Although there
    have not yet been any material adverse repercussions resulting
    from this political change, multiparty rule is still relatively
    new in Mexico and changes in laws, president, public policies
    and government programs could result in economic or political
    conditions that could materially and adversely affect the
    Mexican operations. KCS cannot predict the impact that this new
    political landscape will have on the Mexican economy.
    Furthermore, KCSM’s financial condition, results of
    operations and prospects may be affected by currency
    fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation,
    social instability and other political, social and economic
    developments in or affecting Mexico.

Mexican national politicians are currently focused on certain
    regional political and social tension, and reforms regarding
    fiscal and labor policies, gas, electricity, social security,
    and oil have not been and may not be approved. The social and
    political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican
    economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business, financial condition, and results of
    operation.



The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment
    deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. There are
    currently no exchange controls in Mexico. However, Mexico has
    imposed foreign exchange controls in the past. Pursuant to the
    provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of
    payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the
    future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange
    controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by
    United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange
    control policy could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    obtain dollars or to convert pesos into dollars for purposes of
    making interest and principal payments due on indebtedness, to
    the extent KCS may have to effect those conversions, and could
    adversely affect the Mexican economy or the Company’s
    investment in KCSM. This could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business and financial condition.

Securities of companies in emerging market countries tend to be
    influenced by economic and market conditions in other emerging
    market countries. Some emerging market countries, including
    Argentina and Brazil, have experienced significant economic
    downturns and market volatility in the past. These events have
    had an adverse effect on the economic conditions and securities
    markets of other emerging market countries, including Mexico.

Downturns
    in the United States economy or in trade between the United
    States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar
    exchange rate would likely have adverse effects on KCS’
    business and results of operations.

The level and timing of KCS’ Mexican business activity is
    heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican
    trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican
    operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for
    the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico
    and the United States in these markets at any given time, and
    tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the
    United States or Mexican economy or in trade between the
    United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on
    KCS’ business results of operations and our ability to meet
    debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has invested
    significant amounts in developing its intermodal operations at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, in part to provide Asian
    importers with an alternative to West Coast ports, and the level
    of intermodal traffic depends, to an extent, on the volume of
    Asian shipments routed through Lázaro Cárdenas.
    Reduction in trading volumes between KCS and its Asian trading
    partners, which may be caused by factors beyond KCS’
    control, including increased government regulations in light of
    recent concerns regarding the safety and quality of
    Asian-manufactured products, may adversely affect KCS’
    business and results of operations.

Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate could lead
    to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and
    exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of
    the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be
    offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities
    KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase
    might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future
    developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the
    Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight
    volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and
    commodities KCSM carries.

Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of
    KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely
    affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness.
    Severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may result in
    disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may
    limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of
    interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness.
    Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and
    for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of
    Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of
    Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute
    restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability
    to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other
    currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the
    U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments.
    Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the
    U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar
    prices for KCS’ securities. Currency fluctuations are
    likely to continue to have an effect on KCS’ financial
    condition in future periods.



Mexico
    may experience high levels of inflation in the future which
    could adversely affect KCS’ results of
    operations.

Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation and may
    experience high inflation in the future. During most of the
    1980s and during the mid and late 1990s, Mexico experienced
    periods of high levels of inflation. The annual rates of
    inflation for the last three years, as measured by changes in
    the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by Banco de
    Mexico, were 3.8% in 2007, 4.0% in 2006, and 3.3% in 2005. A
    substantial increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have
    the effect of increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could
    adversely affect its results of operations and financial
    condition. High levels of inflation may also affect the balance
    of trade between Mexico and the United States, and other
    countries, which could adversely affect KCSM’s results of
    operations.

KCSR, in support of its transportation operations, owns and
    operates repair shops, depots and office buildings along its
    right-of-way. A major facility, the Deramus Yard, is located in
    Shreveport, Louisiana and



includes a general office building, locomotive repair shop, car
    repair shops, customer service center, material warehouses and
    fueling facilities totaling 227,000 square feet. Other
    facilities owned by KCSR include a 21,000 square foot
    freight car repair shop in Kansas City, Missouri and
    15,000 square feet of office space in Baton Rouge,
    Louisiana. A locomotive repair facility in Kansas City is owned
    and operated by General Electric Company (“GE”) and is
    used to maintain and repair locomotives that were manufactured
    by GE and are leased and owned by KCSR.

KCSR owns 16.6% of the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company,
    which owns and operates 80 miles of track, and operates an
    additional eight miles of track under trackage rights in greater
    Kansas City, Missouri. KCSR also leases, for operating purposes,
    certain short sections of trackage owned by various other
    railroad companies and jointly owns certain other facilities
    with these railroads.

Mexico
    Segment.

Under its Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM has the
    right to operate the rail lines, but does not own the land,
    roadway, or associated structures. The Concession requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects, including
    capital projects described in a business plan filed every five
    years with the Mexican government. KCSM may defer capital
    expenditures with respect to its five-year business plan with
    the permission of the SCT. However, should the SCT not grant
    this permission, KCSM’s failure to comply with the
    commitments in its business plan could result in fines and
    ultimately the Mexican government revoking the Concession. See
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors — KCSM’s Mexican
    Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain
    circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating its
    railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business and financial condition.”

    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

is incorporated by reference in partial response to this
    Item 5.

Dividend
    Policy.

Common Stock.

KCS has not declared any cash
    dividends on its common stock during the last five fiscal years
    and it does not anticipate making any cash dividend payments to
    common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Pursuant to
    KCSR’s credit agreement, KCS is prohibited from the payment
    of cash dividends on its common stock.

Preferred Stock.

Kansas City Southern is
    restricted from paying dividends on its Series C Preferred
    Stock and Series D Preferred Stock when its coverage ratio
    (as defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes and


/


% Senior
    Notes) is less than 2.0:1. It is the Company’s intention to
    pay timely dividends on all preferred stock in either cash or
    stock, depending upon the terms of the preferred stock, when
    dividend payments are not restricted under the covenants of its
    various debt agreements and the Company has adequate levels of
    liquidity. In the event that dividends on the Series C
    Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears
    for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number of days in
    the aggregate, whether or not consecutive), holders of the
    Series C Preferred Stock or the Series D Preferred
    Stock, as applicable, will be entitled to elect two of the
    authorized number of directors at the next annual
    stockholders’ meeting, and at each subsequent
    stockholders’ meeting until such time as all accumulated
    dividends are paid on the Series C Preferred Stock or the
    Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, or set aside for
    payment.

The response to Item 301 of

Regulation S-K

under Part II Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” of this

Form 10-K

is incorporated by reference in partial response to this
    Item 6.

OTHER
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSED

KCS reports its financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The
    Company’s earnings releases, presentations, and 8-K filings
    use certain non-GAAP measures. These measures should be
    considered in addition to, but not as a substitute or preferable
    to, other information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures used
    to review and in certain cases manage the Company’s
    business may provide its users of the financial information with
    additional meaningful comparison when reviewing the
    Company’s results.

KCS management at times uses non-GAAP information in its
    planning and forecasting processes and to further analyze its
    own financial trends and operational performance, as well as
    making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a
    similar basis. The Company also uses some of these measures
    internally as part of its incentive compensation plans for
    management employees. Management believes investors and users of
    the Company’s financial information should consider all of
    the above factors when evaluating KCS’ results and believes
    these can be particularly useful in assessing comparability of
    the Company’s performance for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Non-GAAP financial information previously disclosed by the
    Company used in earnings releases, presentations, or other
    materials can be found on its website in the investor relations
    section of content. Some of KCS’ non-GAAP measures may
    differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if
    similar terms are used to identify such measures.



Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion is intended to clarify and focus on
    Kansas City Southern’s results of operations, certain
    changes in its financial position, liquidity, capital structure
    and business developments for the periods covered by the

    this

Form 10-K.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

    Financial Overview.

The Company achieved consolidated net income of
    $153.8 million in 2007, as compared to net income of
    $108.9 million in 2006, representing an increase in net
    income of $44.9 million over the prior year.

Operating income increased $58.1 million in 2007 to
    $362.4 million as compared to $304.3 million in 2006.
    The increase in operating income was driven primarily by
    increased revenues during the year. The Company achieved record
    revenues of $1,742.8 million in 2007, which was a 5%
    increase over revenues of $1,659.7 million in 2006. The
    revenue increase was primarily driven by price increases, new
    and expanding business in both the U.S. and Mexico, and
    through the continued operational efficiencies obtained with
    operations coordinated across the network system.

Cash flows from operations increased to $381.5 million in
    2007 compared with $267.5 million in 2006, an increase of
    $114.0 million. Capital expenditures are a significant use
    of cash flows annually due to the capital intensive nature of
    railroad operations. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2007
    was $410.5 million as compared to $241.8 million in
    2006.

    Outlook.

Kansas City Southern expects to continue to achieve its
    operational improvement across its entire network with a
    management focus on execution and realizing the full value of
    the network KCS has linked together. Consolidated revenue growth
    in 2008 is expected to be in the high single digits. Price
    increases and intermodal growth originating at the port of
    Lázaro Cárdenas are expected to be key drivers of
    growth while KCS continues to position its network to increase
    length of haul and cross border traffic.

With continued productivity increases in operations as well as
    the projected revenue growth, the full year operating ratio for
    2008 is expected to fall by a full percentage point or more;
    although, the Company believes seasonality of business and the
    timing of various initiatives will have an impact on the
    quarter-over-quarter improvement trends in the first half of the
    year.

The Company believes that liquidity will continue to improve
    with anticipated improvements in operating income and continued
    focus on working capital reduction.

The Company projects cash capital expenditures to maintain the
    railroad and meet anticipated future demand will be about
    $500 million in 2008. KCS also plans to acquire 30 new
    locomotives for U.S. operations through a leveraged lease
    arrangement at a cost of about $65 million.

PCRC, an equity investment of KCS, is expected to have even
    stronger growth in volumes and cash flow as KCS continues to
    realize the value of this investment.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007, compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net Income.

Consolidated net income increased
    $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to the same period in 2006. Operating income increased
    by $58.1 million primarily driven by continued increases in
    rates, fuel surcharge, and new and expanded existing business in
    both the U.S. and Mexico segments. Operating expenses
    increase was contained to about 2% in the consolidated
    statements of income as a result of efficiencies from a
    coordinated network.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, revenues increased
    $43.9 million compared to the prior year.
    U.S. operations experienced revenue increases due to
    targeted rate increases partially offset by a decrease in
    carload volumes primarily related to certain haulage business
    reflected in the intermodal and automotive products sector. The
    following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by
    commodity group.

Revenues by commodity

group for 2007

Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased
    $22.4 million for chemical and petroleum products for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, due to targeted rate
    increases and increased traffic volumes, primarily related to
    petroleum, soda ash in the chemicals channel, and plastics
    products.

Forest products and metals.

Revenues increased
    $6.9 million for forest products and metals for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 due to certain rate increases
    primarily in paper products, partially offset by decreases in
    volume due to the declining housing market which negatively
    impacted the lumber products channel.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, due
    to higher rates and an increase in unit train velocity over
    certain corridors increasing capacity. Revenue for all products
    was higher than the 2006 period with one exception where the
    food products channel was flat. Grain traffic accounted for the
    majority of the decrease in carloads, although, revenues related
    to grain were higher than the prior year. For the later part of
    the year, carload volume was adversely affected by wetter than
    normal weather in the south slowing shipments and reducing
    beneficial customer inventories.

Intermodal and automotive.

Revenues decreased
    $0.7 million in the intermodal and automotive sectors for
    the year ended December 31, 2007. Decreases in the
    intermodal business unit were primarily due to the reduction in
    volume related to certain haulage business. The aforementioned
    decrease in the intermodal business unit was partially offset by
    new intermodal haulage business and an increase in volumes for
    automotive business reflecting the increased production of U.S.
    automotives.

Coal.

Revenue increased $16.2 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, as a result of increased
    rates related to new and updated contracts and overall increases
    in car volumes to electric generating stations driven by strong
    demand.



Operating expenses.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, U.S. operating expenses increased
    $22.7 million. The following summarizes the Company’s
    U.S. operating expenses

(in millions).

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits decreased $5.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to
    increases in the allocation of various incentive compensation to
    Mexico as a result of certain process coordination, increased
    overhead capitalization due to updated studies, and a favorable
    decrease in estimated labor costs following certain labor
    contract negotiations in the first half of 2007. Decreases were
    partially offset by annual wage and salary merit increases, new
    collective bargaining agreements effective in the third quarter,
    and higher healthcare costs as compared to the prior year.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    increased $13.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to an
    increased locomotive maintenance program, additional outsourcing
    of related maintenance, and increased cost and use of facilities
    jointly used by the Company and other railroads.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared with 2006, primarily due to increases in the average
    price per gallon of fuel while consumption remained flat.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs decreased
    $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006. Decreases reflect lower short-term locomotive
    lease expense due to a reduced reliance on short-term leased
    locomotives driven by improved locomotive availability, as well
    as lower rates on the use of certain other short-term leased
    locomotives.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization decreased $2.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006,
    primarily due to final adjustments related to the depreciation
    rate study completed in the fourth quarter of 2006. Offsetting
    these decreases were increases in depreciation expense driven by
    a higher capital base.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expenses increased $15.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The number of
    derailment incidents declined in 2007 compared with the 2006
    period; however, derailment costs were higher driven by an
    increase in the severity of certain derailment incidents.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    decreased $3.4 million for year ended December 31,
    2007, compared to 2006, due to lower sales and use tax as a
    result of a favorable tax ruling in the first quarter of 2007,
    lower state franchise tax expense, and decreases in
    miscellaneous rental expenses. Decreases were partially offset
    by increased materials and supplies used for the maintenance of
    locomotives and freight cars and increased costs related to
    legal obligations for the removal of certain assets at the end
    of their useful lives.

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled
    $813.2 million compared to $774.0 million for the
    comparable year ended December 31, 2006, which represented
    an increase of $39.2 million. This increase is primarily
    due to targeted rate increases and increased fuel surcharge
    participation, partially offset by a decrease in carload volumes
    primarily in the forest products and metals commodity group. The
    following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by
    commodity group.

Revenues by commodity

group for 2007

Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased
    $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006, due to targeted price
    increases and increases in shipments of soda ash in the
    chemicals channel and plastic import products, partially offset
    by a decrease in volumes in plastic exports.

Forest products and metals.

Revenues decreased
    $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006, due to a reduction of beer
    export shipments in the other channel, and reductions in pulp
    paper as well as lower appliance shipments in the domestic
    market.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues from
    agriculture and minerals products increased $13.3 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. The increase in revenue is a result of targeted
    price increases across all channels and increased cross border
    business due to higher import shipments of grain and grain
    products, partially offset by a reduction in traffic at the
    ports of Veracruz and Altamira, mainly impacting the grain
    channel.



Intermodal and automotive.

Revenues and
    volumes increased $17.5 million for intermodal and
    automotive during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared
    to the same period in 2006. The intermodal revenue and volume
    increase is a result of rate increases and continued increases
    in traffic at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas. The
    increased traffic at Lázaro Cárdenas is related to
    port expansion tripling capacity, organic growth, and the
    addition of two new steamship customers. Automotive revenues and
    volumes have increased driven by continued development and
    expansion of the automotive network in Mexico.

Coal.

Revenues increased $1.9 million
    during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the
    same period in 2006. Increases primarily reflect new coal
    shipments from Lázaro Cárdenas to Nava.

Operating expenses.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, Mexico operating expenses increased
    $2.3 million. The following summarizes Mexico operating

Compensation and benefits.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compensation and benefits increased
    $5.7 million, compared to 2006, primarily due to increased
    incentive compensation expense, certain fringe benefits,
    pension, and severance costs. Increases were partially offset by
    a decrease in the Mexico statutory profit sharing expense as
    compared to prior year.

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense
    decreased $24.4 million in 2007 compared to 2006. This
    decrease reflects a reclassification of certain customer
    switching and transloading costs as revenue deductions, reduced
    telecommunications expenses, and reductions in the cost of
    maintenance of locomotives. Decreases were partially offset by
    an increase in legal and corporate expenses.

Fuel.

For the year ended December 31,
    2007, fuel increased $6.9 million, compared to the same
    period 2006. Fuel expense increases were driven by higher diesel
    fuel prices partially offset by higher gross ton miles per
    gallon in the latter half of the year.

Equipment cost.

Equipment cost increased
    $9.8 million, compared to 2006, primarily due to a
    reclassification of customer car hire billed at the border,
    which was reclassified to revenues in 2007 and an increase in
    software license expenses related to operational systems.
    Increases were partially offset by reduced locomotive and car
    leases expense.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31,
    2007 increased $7.4 million, compared to the same period in
    2006, primarily due to a higher asset base as a result of
    capital expenditures.

Casualties and insurance.

During 2007,
    casualties and insurance expense increased $2.6 million,
    compared to 2006, due to higher costs associated with a few
    large derailments and increased vandalism to KCMS’s cars
    compared to the same period last year.

Materials and other.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, materials and other cost decreased
    $5.7 million, compared to the same period in 2006. The
    decrease reflects reduced allowances for freight receivables
    primarily due to favorable loss experience and lower
    receivables. This decrease was partially offset by increases in
    miscellaneous rents and inventory adjustments.



Consolidated
    Non-Operating Expenses.

Consolidated Interest Expense.

Interest
    expense decreased $10.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006.
    Reduced interest expense reflects the refinancing of KCSM’s
    higher rate debt (see consolidated debt retirement costs for
    more information), as well as the reversal of accrued estimated
    interest expense related to KCSM post-acquisition contingencies
    settled with TMM in the third quarter of 2007.

Consolidated Debt Retirement
    Costs.

Consolidated debt retirement costs
    increased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. In June
    of 2007, KCSM redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due in 2012 and entered into a new bank credit agreement.
    As a result of these transactions, there was a net
    $6.9 million write-off of debt retirement costs. Included
    in the debt retirement costs was a charge of $16.7 million
    for the call premium on the senior notes, which was partially
    offset by a $9.8 million reduction of unamortized purchase
    accounting effects associated with the

% Senior
    Notes. During 2006, KCSR entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement and wrote off $2.2 million of unamortized
    debt issuance costs and KCSM refinanced its


/


% senior
    notes and wrote off $2.6 million of unamortized debt
    issuance costs.

Foreign Exchange.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the foreign exchange loss was
    $0.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, due to
    fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus Mexican
    peso exchange rates.

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $11.4 million and
    $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Significant components of this change were
    as follows:

•

Equity in earnings from the operations of PCRC was
    $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Loss in earnings was $1.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to
    increased revenue driven by increasing volume growth.

•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $4.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to
    $5.4 million for the same period in 2006. The decrease
    primarily reflects a reduction in lease income attributed to
    fewer assets being leased than the prior year period.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $2.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to
    $2.9 million for the same period in 2006.

Other Income.

Other income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $12.0 million which consists
    primarily of miscellaneous interest and dividend income as well
    as gains on sales of land. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, other income was $18.7 million which consisted of
    miscellaneous interest income, dividend income, royalty income,
    and gains on sales of land and certain other long-term assets
    that were not associated with KCS’s railroad operations.

Consolidated Income Tax Expense (Benefit).

For
    the year ended December 31, 2007, KCS’ income tax
    expense was $67.1 million, a change of $21.7 million
    as compared to an expense of $45.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate increased
    from 29.4% to 30.3% for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2007, respectively. There were no significant items that
    caused the fluctuation in the rate from the prior year.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006, compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net Income.

Consolidated net income increased
    $139.9 million excluding the 2005 non-recurring VAT/Put
    settlement for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
    to the same period in 2005. Results for 2005 reflect nine months
    of activity for KCSM (Mexico segment) which represents the
    periods after the date of acquisition, April, 1 2005. Including
    the $131.9 million VAT/Put settlement in 2005, consolidated
    net income increased $8.0 million. Operating income
    increased by $242.0 million primarily driven by targeted
    price increases and fuel surcharge, new and expanded existing
    business across the rail network, and the continued



coordination of operations as well as a full year of
    consolidated operating results for Mexico. Operating expenses
    increased by only 5% due to increased efficiencies from a
    coordinated network.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues increased
    $81.3 million compared to the prior year. The
    U.S. segment experienced revenue increases in all commodity
    groups except for the intermodal and automotive business, which
    decreased slightly due to a decline in automotive business
    driven by lower output and short term plant shutdowns in 2006.
    Overall, increases in most of the commodities were driven by
    targeted price improvements, including increased fuel
    surcharges. The following discussion provides an analysis of
    revenues by commodity group.

Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased
    $16.9 million in the chemical and petroleum products for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, due to targeted rate
    increases in the petroleum, agricultural chemicals and
    industrial gases sectors, and increased traffic volumes. Pricing
    improvement and stronger economic conditions during 2006
    accounted for a majority of the growth in revenue in the year,
    while growth in the third and fourth quarters also reflected the
    Gulf Coast refineries’ recovery from the past year’s
    hurricanes.

Forest products and metals.

Revenues increased
    $23.1 million in forest products and metal commodities for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to targeted
    rate increases. Decreases in volume can be attributed to the
    lumber and chip products due to rising mortgage rates. This
    volume decline was only partially offset by increases in volume
    from higher production in the metals, rolled paper and military
    products.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased
    $17.9 million in the agriculture and minerals products for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, due to targeted rate
    adjustments and an increase in velocity over certain corridors
    and business sectors. Overall improvement in velocity of unit
    grain and mineral trains accounted for a majority of the revenue
    growth during 2006. Declining market conditions during the third
    and fourth quarters of the year accounted for the decline in
    volume with the primary decrease in export grain.

Intermodal and automotive.

Revenues decreased
    $1.8 million in the intermodal and automotive business for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, due to declines in the
    automotive business from suspended production at an automotive
    plant for a majority of the year. This decrease was offset
    partially by increased revenues in the intermodal business which
    was driven by higher volumes from existing customers as well as
    the generation of new intermodal business.

Coal.

Revenues increased $22.0 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, as a result of higher
    traffic volumes at certain electric generating stations in order
    to rebuild inventory stockpiles. The ability to



rebuild stockpiles has been made possible by improved
    efficiencies at the coal mines and increased velocity achieved
    by KCSR and origin carriers.

Operating expenses.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, U.S. operating expenses increased
    $0.8 million. The following summarizes the Company’s
    U.S. operating expenses

(in millions).

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits expense increased $19.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to 2005, as the result of
    increased incentive compensation, annual salary increases,
    increased management headcount, and an increase in stock based
    compensation. Incentive compensation is tied to the financial
    results of the Company and accounted for about half of the
    increase. Stock based compensation increased partially as a
    result of the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense
    decreased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease was
    primarily driven by decreases in legal costs, locomotive repair
    costs and rental income received on locomotives leased to Mexico
    operations on a short-term basis. The decreases were offset by
    increases in joint facilities expenses due to higher traffic and
    an increase in auto and truck repair expense.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005, primarily as a result of a increases in the
    average price per gallon of fuel and increases in consumption
    due to higher volumes.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased
    $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005, as a result of entering into two new
    locomotive lease agreements and new freight car leases during
    the year. This increase was offset by a decrease in car hire
    expense due to a reduction in the use of non-KCSR freight cars.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense increased $5.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period
    in 2005, primarily due to an increase in assets placed into
    service during the year. This increase was partially offset by
    an updated depreciation study which was completed during the
    year and resulted in a reduction in expense in the
    4th quarter.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expense decreased $43.8 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. During the third
    quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a large pre-tax charge for
    personal injury liabilities based upon an actuarial study in
    2005. The remaining decrease in 2006 was primarily driven by a
    lower number of incidences as well as a decrease in the severity
    of derailments during the year compared to the prior year.

Materials and other.

Other expense decreased
    $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the
    reimbursement from the Mexico segment for shared service
    expenses paid by the U.S. segment during 2006. This was
    offset by an increase in materials and supplies primarily
    reflecting significant price increases for replacement freight
    car wheels.



Mexico
    Segment.

KCS acquired a controlling interest in KCSM effective
    April 1, 2005. The 2005 results reflect charges and costs
    associated with the acquisition, as well as the effect of
    valuation adjustments as required by purchase accounting. Since
    April 1, 2005, the financial results of KCSM have been
    consolidated into KCS. Prior to that date, the investment for
    KCSM was accounted for under the equity method. Although not
    consolidated prior to April 1, 2005, pro forma revenue
    information presented below includes KCSM results for the first
    quarter of 2005 as if the change of control had occurred on
    January 1, 2005. Due to the acquisition, as well as the
    valuation adjustments required from purchase accounting, the
    expense information below is only presented for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005. Accounting policies for KCSM prior
    to the acquisition were materially consistent with
    U.S. operations, however, certain adjustments have been
    made to the results presented for comparability.

Revenues.

The following table summarizes
    consolidated Mexico revenues, including the revenues (in
    millions) and carloads statistics (in thousands), for the years

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled
    $774.0 million compared to $717.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, which represented an increase of
    $56.4 million. Revenues increased despite a decrease in
    carloads mainly due to a reduction in the movement of finished
    vehicles for exportation. The increase in 2006 was mainly
    attributable to targeted rate increases and fuel surcharge.
    Carloads are a standard measure used by KCS to determine the
    volume of traffic transported over its rail lines. Imports into
    Mexico from the U.S., Canada and overseas represented
    approximately 56.3% and 56.2% of total revenues in 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Approximately 80% of total revenues in 2006
    were attributable to international freight.

Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased
    $10.5 million in 2006 primarily due to price increases and
    fuel surcharge revenue volumes remained flat compared to the
    same period in 2006.

Forest products and metals.

Revenues increased
    $23.2 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to
    price strategies, longer hauls and increased fuel surcharge.
    Targeted rate increases were implemented in 2006 for movements
    of steel slabs and steel coil imports. Increased revenue was
    seen from longer hauls to



Laredo as a result of a customer’s relocation of its
    distribution center from Zacatecas to Tuxtepec. Increases in the
    number of cross border paper imports were seen during the year
    as well.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues from
    agriculture products increased $15.9 million compared to
    2005 primarily as a result of targeted rate increases and fuel
    surcharges. Volume increases in corn and sugar were partially
    offset by reductions in import shipments of soybeans, sorghum
    and wheat products. Revenues also grew due to an embargo on
    Ferromex lines. The fructose market increased and continued to
    grow without quotas on imports. The revenue increase has been
    favorable with movements of grain and products from
    U.S. origin to destinations on the KCSM lines. These
    increases were negatively affected by a reduction of volumes of
    sand and clay products, and lower traffic in route from Jaltipan
    to Queretaro, due to dwell times at Ferrovalle. Additionally,
    revenues were also affected by the reduction in consumption of
    limestone in Lázaro Cárdenas during the second quarter
    2006.

Intermodal and automotive.

Intermodal revenue
    increased $7.9 million during 2006 compared to 2005, as a
    result of increased numbers of steamship carriers that call at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas and consistent transit
    times on intermodal trains, which partially offset the overall
    decrease in the intermodal and automotive category. Automotive
    revenue decreased $14.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005,
    as a result of a reduction in the movement of finished vehicles
    for exportation to the U.S. and Canadian markets.
    Additionally, the movements of importation of finished vehicles,
    as well as the domestic distribution of these vehicles, have
    declined due to the logistics of their transportation.

Coal.

For the year ended December 31,
    2006, coal revenues increased $6.2 million compared to
    2005. This increase was mainly due to petcoke volume recovery in
    2006 and it reflects the price strategies, longer hauls and
    increases in fuel surcharges over the prior period.

Compensation and benefits.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, salaries, wages, employee benefits and
    employee statutory profit sharing expense decreased
    $7.4 million compared to the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005. For the three month period prior to the
    acquisition of KCSM, compensation and benefits expense was
    $29.3 million. The decrease reflects the result of four
    Supreme Court decisions in May of 2005 which denied the
    deductibility of NOL’s in a company’s profit sharing
    liability calculation. As a result of these court rulings, the
    Company wrote down the deferred profit sharing asset associated
    with these NOL’s during 2005, which resulted in a non-cash
    charge to income. Additionally, the Company had reductions in
    headcount which were partially offset by salary increases and an
    increase in wages and fringe benefits resulting from labor
    negotiations in July 2006.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    increased $22.3 million in 2006 compared to the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005. For the three month period prior
    to the acquisition of KCSM, purchased services expense was
    $36.8 million. The net decrease is due to certain trackage
    rights that were not used during 2006, resulting in a cost
    reduction, amortization of deferred credits established in
    connection with the purchase accounting and additional
    capitalization of certain overhead costs, as well as reduced
    purchased services



during this year. These decreases were slightly offset by
    increases in management and professional fees during 2006.

Fuel.

Fuel expenses increased
    $29.7 million in 2006 compared to the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005. For the three month period prior to the
    acquisition of KCSM, fuel expense was $23.2 million. The
    increase is primarily due to the increase in the average price
    per gallon of fuel compared to the prior period.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased
    $16.1 million compared to the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005. For the three month period prior to the
    acquisition of KCSM, equipment costs expense was
    $21.5 million. The net decrease was attributed mainly to a
    reduction in the use of non-KCSM freight cars as a result of
    operations improvement. This decrease was partially offset by
    the amortization of certain deferred charges and credits
    established in connection with purchase accounting adjustments
    related to the value of operating leases for freight cars.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expenses in 2006 increased by
    $22.2 million compared to the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005. For the three month period prior to the
    acquisition of KCSM, depreciation expense was $21.8 million.

Casualties and insurance.

During 2006,
    casualties and insurance decreased $6.2 million, compared
    to the nine months ended December 31, 2005. For the three
    month period prior to the acquisition of KCSM, casualties and
    insurance expense was $2.3 million. The decrease was
    primarily the result of lower costs associated with derailments
    compared to activity that occurred during the second and third
    quarter of 2005.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    expenses decreased $11.1 million compared to the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005. For the three month period
    prior to the acquisition of KCSM, materials and other expense
    was $8.9 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower bad
    debt expense as compared to 2005, the recognition of transition
    costs in 2005, a charge due to the revaluation of inventory
    parts associated with the maintenance of a former catenary line
    in the second quarter 2005 and losses on sale on property prior
    to adoption of the mass asset group method of depreciation.

Consolidated
    Non-Operating Expenses.

Consolidated Interest Expense.

Consolidated
    interest expense increased $33.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, which primarily reflects the additional
    three months of KCSM interest expense in 2006. The remaining
    difference was due to higher average balance as well as
    increased interest rates on floating rate debt in the year.

Consolidated Debt Retirement
    Costs.

Consolidated debt retirement costs
    increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. During
    the year ended December 31, 2006, KCSR entered into an
    amended and restated credit agreement and wrote off
    $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and KCSM
    refinanced its 10.25% senior notes and wrote off
    $2.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. For the
    year ended December 31, 2005, $4.4 million in
    unamortized debt issuance costs were written off in connection
    with the refinancing of KCSM’s 11.75% debentures and
    its first amended and restated credit agreement.

Foreign Exchange.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the foreign exchange loss was
    $3.7 million compared to a gain of $3.5 million for
    the 2005 period due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar
    versus the Mexican peso exchange rate.

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $7.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to $2.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. Significant
    components of this change follow:

•

Equity in losses from the operations of PCRC was
    $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2005. The
    decrease in losses of $0.7 million is the result of higher
    volumes than the prior year period.



•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $5.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $2.8 million for the same period in 2005. The
    $2.6 million increase in earnings is the result of a
    reduction in depreciation expense as a majority of the
    locomotives owned by Southern Capital became fully depreciated
    during the year.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $2.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $2.9 million for the same period in 2005.

•

Equity in losses of KCSM was $1.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005.

Other Income.

Other income increased
    $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    primarily due to the sale of land and other long term assets
    that were not associated with KCS’s railroad operations
    during 2006.

Consolidated Income Tax Provision
    (Benefit).

For the year ended December 31,
    2006, KCS’ income tax expense was $45.4 million, as
    compared to a $7.1 million benefit, a change of
    $52.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.
    The effective tax rate increased from (9.3%) to 29.4% for the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. This
    increase was primarily attributable to the absence of one-time
    items such as the non-taxable VAT/Put settlement which occurred
    in 2005 and the 2005 write-off of deferred profit sharing in
    Mexico.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

KCS’s primary uses of cash are to support operations;
    maintain and improve its railroad and information systems
    infrastructure; pay debt service and preferred stock dividends;
    acquire new and maintain existing locomotives, rolling stock,
    and other equipment used in the operations of KCS; and meet
    other obligations. See “Cash Flow Information and
    Contractual Obligations” below.

As of December 31, 2007, KCS has a debt capitalization
    ratio (total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity) of
    50.4 percent. Its primary sources of liquidity are cash
    flows generated from operations, borrowings under its revolving
    credit facilities and access to debt and equity capital markets.
    Although KCS has had more than adequate access to the capital
    markets, as a highly leveraged company, the financial terms
    under which funding is obtained often contain restrictive
    covenants. The covenants constrain financial flexibility by
    restricting or prohibiting certain actions, including the
    ability to incur additional debt for any purpose other than
    refinancing existing debt, create or suffer to exist additional
    liens, make prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends on
    common stock, make capital investments, engage in transactions
    with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell
    certain assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations or in
    sale-leaseback transactions. On December 31, 2007, total
    available liquidity (the unrestricted cash balance plus
    revolving credit facility availability) was approximately
    $122 million. Year end liquidity was reduced by about
    $118 million related to the acquisition of 55 new
    locomotives by KCSM. A portion of the purchase price of these
    locomotives will be financed with debt in early 2008, increasing
    available liquidity by about $98 million.

As a result of KCS acquiring a controlling interest in KCSM,
    KCSM has become subject to the terms and conditions of the
    indentures governing KCSR’s two senior notes issues. The
    restrictive covenants of these indentures limit the ability of
    KCSM to incur additional debt for any purpose other than the
    refinancing of existing debt and certain new asset financing.

The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash
    and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to capital
    markets, and other available financing resources will be
    sufficient to fund anticipated operating, capital and debt
    service requirements and other commitments through 2008.
    However, KCS’ operating cash flow and financing
    alternatives can be unexpectedly impacted by various factors,
    some of which are outside of its control. For example, if KCS
    was to experience a substantial reduction in revenues or a
    substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities,
    its operating cash flows could be significantly reduced.
    Additionally, the Company is subject to economic factors
    surrounding capital markets and its ability



to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to market
    conditions. Recent capital market volatility and the tightening
    of market liquidity could impact KCS’ access to capital.
    Further, KCS’ cost of debt can be impacted by independent
    rating agencies, which assign debt ratings based on certain
    credit measurements such as interest coverage and leverage
    ratios.

As of December 31, 2007, Standard & Poor’s
    Rating Service (“S&P”) rated the senior secured
    debt as BB, the senior unsecured debt as B, and the preferred
    stock as CCC+. S&P also maintained a corporate rating on
    KCS of B+ and gave KCS a developing outlook, which the Company
    believes is positive. Moody’s Investor Service
    (“Moody’s”) rated the senior secured debt as Ba2,
    the senior unsecured debt of KCSR as B3, the senior unsecured
    debt of KCSM as B2, and the preferred stock as Caa1.
    Moody’s also maintained a probability of default rating on
    KCS of B2 and gave KCS a stable outlook.

Long
    Term Debt and Credit Facility Activity.

On January 29, 2007, the Company commenced a consent
    solicitation to amend the indentures under which KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2008 (the
    “9


/


% Notes”)
    and


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009 (the
    “7


/


% Notes”
    and together with the


/


% Notes,
    the “Notes”) were issued. The Company identified
    certain inconsistencies in the language of the indentures which
    prevented KCS from obtaining a coverage ratio of at least
    2.00:1. The purpose of the consent solicitation was to
    (i) resolve an inconsistency in the inclusion of certain
    expenses, but not the income, of restricted subsidiaries in the
    calculation of the consolidated coverage ratio under the
    indentures, (ii) amend the definition of refinancing
    indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain related premiums,
    interest, fees and expenses in permitted refinancing
    indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any defaults
    arising from certain actions taken in the absence of such
    proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    obtained the requisite consents from the holders of each series
    of Notes to amend their respective indentures as described above
    and executed supplemental indentures containing such amendments
    and waivers.

On January 31, 2007, KCS provided written notice to the
    lenders under KCSR’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
    dated as of April 28, 2006 (the “2006 Credit
    Agreement”) of certain representation and other defaults
    under the 2006 Credit Agreement arising from the potential
    defaults which existed under the KCSR indentures governing the
    Notes as described in the previous paragraph. These defaults
    limited KCSR’s access to the revolving credit facility. In
    its notice of default, the Company also requested that the
    lenders waive these defaults. On February 5, 2007, the
    Company received a waiver of such defaults from all of the
    lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Company is
    currently not in default of the 2006 Credit Agreement and has
    access to the revolving credit facility. At December 31,
    2007, advances under the revolving credit facility were
    $120.0 million, with $5.0 million remaining available
    under the facility.

On May 16, 2007, KCSM issued $165.0 million principal
    amount of new


/


% senior
    unsecured notes due June 1, 2014 (the
    “7


/


% Senior
    Notes”). The


/


% Senior
    Notes are denominated in U.S. dollars, bear interest
    semiannually at a fixed annual rate of


/


%
    and are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank

pari
    passu

in right of payment with KCSM’s existing and
    future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. KCSM used the net
    proceeds from the issuance of the


/


% Senior
    Notes, together with a $30.0 million bank term loan and
    available cash on hand, as necessary, to pay the principal,
    applicable premium and expenses associated with the redemption
    of KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012. The


/


% Senior
    Notes are redeemable at KCSM’s option, in whole but not in
    part, at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and
    unpaid interest, at any time in the event of certain changes in
    Mexican tax law, and in whole or in part, on or after
    June 1, 2011, at the redemption price set forth in the
    indenture under which the


/


% Senior
    Notes were issued, subject to certain limitations. The


/


% Senior
    Notes include certain covenants that restrict, limit or prohibit
    certain actions.

On May 31, 2007, KCSR entered into Amendment No. 1 to
    the 2006 Credit Agreement which provides for a new
    $75.0 million term loan facility (the “Term Loan C
    Facility”) with a final maturity date of April 28,
    2013. The 2006 Credit Agreement, however, provides for an
    earlier termination date that is 90 days prior to the
    earliest final maturity date of any outstanding


/


% Notes
    and


/


% Notes
    unless the 2006 Credit Agreement facilities are rated at least
    Ba3 by Moody’s and BB+ by S&P in each case, with at
    least stable



outlooks, or prior to such date, the


/


% Notes
    and


/


% Notes
    have been refinanced in full, or an amount sufficient to
    indefeasibly repay such


/


% Notes
    and


/


% Notes
    has been deposited with the applicable note trustee. The
    earliest final maturity date of the


/


% Notes
    and


/


% Notes
    is currently October 1, 2008. Based upon the aforementioned
    termination provision, the rating criteria of S&P have not
    been met resulting in a maturity date of July 3, 2008. The
    Company intends to refinance the


/


% Notes
    prior to such date. During the third quarter of 2007, the
    Company reclassified the obligations outstanding under the 2006
    Credit Agreement from long term debt to current debt and as of
    December 31, 2007, the obligations reclassified from long
    term debt to current debt totaled $437.1 million. The Term
    Loan C Facility bears interest at either LIBOR plus
    150 basis points or an alternative base rate plus
    50 basis points. Proceeds from advances under the Term Loan
    C Facility were used to reduce amounts outstanding under
    KCSR’s revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. Except as amended and supplemented by Amendment
    No. 1, all terms of the 2006 Credit Agreement remain in
    full force and effect.

On June 14, 2007, KCSM entered into a new credit agreement,
    (the “2007 KCSM Credit Agreement”), in an aggregate
    amount of up to $111.0 million, consisting of a revolving
    credit facility of up to $81.0 million, and a term loan
    facility of up to $30.0 million with Bank of America, N.A.,
    BBVA Bancomer, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple,
    and the other lenders named in the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement.
    KCSM used the proceeds from the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement to
    pay (a) all amounts outstanding under KCSM’s Credit
    Agreement dated October 24, 2005, (the “2005 KCSM
    Credit Agreement”), and to pay all fees and expenses
    related to the refinancing of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement,
    (b) to pay all amounts outstanding in respect of
    KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2007, (c) to refinance a portion of KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012, (d) to pay all amounts outstanding under
    KCSM’s Bridge Loan Agreement dated April 30, 2007, and
    (e) for general corporate purposes. The maturity date for
    the revolving credit facility is December 30, 2011, and the
    maturity date for the term loan facility is June 29, 2012.
    The 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict,
    limit or prohibit certain actions that are customary for these
    types of agreements. In addition, KCSM must meet certain
    consolidated interest coverage ratios, consolidated leverage
    ratios, and fixed charge coverage ratios. KCSM is not currently
    in default of the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement and has access to
    the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2007,
    advances under the revolving credit facility were
    $20.0 million, with $61.0 million remaining available
    under the facility.

On December 19, 2007, KCSM entered into Amendment and
    Waiver No. 1 to the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement (“KCSM
    Amendment and Waiver No. 1”) to modify certain terms
    to permit KCSM to finance the acquisition of new locomotives by
    incurring indebtedness on an accelerated basis as compared to
    the original terms contained in the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement.
    The KCSM Amendment and Waiver No. 1 also waives certain
    prospective defaults under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement as of
    the quarter ended December 31, 2007, as a result of the
    acquisition of the new locomotives in the fourth quarter of
    2007, in order to permit the Company sufficient time to complete
    its financing of the new locomotives.

During 2007, the consolidated cash position decreased
    $23.5 million due to capital expenditures, payments made
    under the Settlement Agreement with TMM, and the payment of
    preferred stock dividends in



arrears, partially offset by increased operating income.
    Included in capital expenditures is approximately
    $118.0 million for locomotives purchased through December
    2007, of which the Company intends to finance approximately
    $98.0 million in the first quarter of 2008. During 2006,
    the consolidated cash position increased $47.9 million due
    to increased operating income which was partially offset by
    additional payments for the acquisition of KCSM and the
    refinancing and repayment of debt.

KCS’ cash flow from operations has historically been
    positive and sufficient to fund operations, roadway capital
    expenditures, other capital improvements and debt service.
    External sources of cash (principally bank debt, public debt,
    preferred stock and leases) have been used to refinance existing
    indebtedness and to fund acquisitions, new investments and
    equipment additions.

Net operating cash flows for 2007 increased $114.0 million
    to $381.5 million compared to $267.5 million in 2006.
    The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
    to better operating performance and changes in working capital
    balances relating to the timing of payments and receipts. Net
    operating cash flows for 2006 increased $88.7 million to
    $267.5 million compared to $178.8 million in 2005.
    This increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
    to better operating performance and the consolidation of KCSM
    for twelve months in 2006 as compared to nine months in 2005.
    The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital
    balances relating to the timing of payments and receipts.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash
    outflows were $380.5 million and $166.0 million during
    2007 and 2006, respectively. This $214.5 million increase
    was related to increased capital expenditures, decreased
    property sales proceeds and proceeds from loans to affiliates.
    Net investing cash outflows for 2006 decreased
    $123.5 million as compared to 2005, which was related to
    decreased capital expenditures, increased property sales
    proceeds and the receipt of the MSLLC investment from NS.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows
    were derived from the issuance of long-term debt, including
    borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, the issuance
    of preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of common
    stock under employee stock plans. Financing cash outflows were
    used for the repayment of debt, the repurchase of KCS’
    common stock, the payment of dividends on KCS’ preferred
    stock and the payment of debt and preferred stock issuance
    costs. Financing cash flows for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were as
    follows:

•

Financing cash outflows for 2007 were $24.5 million,
    resulting primarily from the costs associated with refinancing
    debt and preferred stock dividend payments. During 2007, KCSM
    issued $165.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and used the proceeds, together with a
    $30.0 million new term loan, to



redeem the KCSM


/


% Senior
    Notes and associated premium and expenses. KCSR entered into an
    amendment to the 2006 Credit Agreement for a new
    $75.0 million term loan facility and used the proceeds to
    reduce amounts outstanding under KCSR’s revolving credit
    facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement. KCSM entered into a
    new credit agreement for a $30.0 million term loan facility
    and a revolving credit facility of up to $81.0 million.
    KCSM used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under
    the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement, to refinance a portion of the


/


% Senior
    Notes, to pay costs associated with these refinancings and to
    pay the remaining amounts outstanding in respect of the
    KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes.

•

Financing cash outflows for 2006 were $53.6 million,
    resulting primarily from the repayment of short and long term
    debt, including amounts related to the KCSM acquisition, and the
    costs associated with refinancing debt. During 2006, KCSR
    entered into a new $371.1 million amended and restated
    credit agreement and used the proceeds to repay all amounts
    outstanding under the previous credit agreement. KCS also
    borrowed a net amount of $27.5 million under the Tex-Mex
    RRIF loan, repaid a net amount of $2.0 million under the
    KCSR revolving credit facility and repaid other amounts. KCSM
    issued $175.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and used the proceeds to purchase
    $146.0 million of its


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and repay $29.0 million under its term loan
    facility. KCSM also used cash on hand to repay all amounts
    outstanding under its revolving credit facility.

•

Financing cash flows for 2005 were $103.2 million,
    resulting primarily from borrowings under the revolving credit
    facilities. During 2005 KCS issued $210.0 million of
    preferred stock and the net proceeds were used to repurchase
    9.0 million shares of KCS common stock. KCS also assumed
    debt under a purchase agreement for 75 locomotives, of which
    $24.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2005,
    borrowed $21.7 million under the Tex-Mex RRIF loan, and had
    borrowings of $92.0 million outstanding at
    December 31, 2005 under the KCSR revolving credit facility.
    KCSM issued $460.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes, and entered into a $106.0 million credit
    facility. The proceeds from these last two financings were used
    by KCSM to repay $443.5 million of senior discount
    debentures, $31.0 million under a bridge loan, the
    remaining balance of $67.5 million under the previous
    credit facility and the costs associated with the transactions.

•

Proceeds from the sale of KCS common stock pursuant to employee
    stock plans were $0.7 million, $8.6 million, and
    $1.7 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

•

Payment of preferred stock cash dividends were
    $23.3 million, $4.3 million and $8.7 million in
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Dividends of approximately
    $0.2 million were paid each year on the 4.0% noncumulative
    preferred stock; approximately $15.0 million,
    $2.1 million and $8.5 million of dividends were paid
    in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, on the Series C
    Preferred Stock; and approximately $8.1 million and
    $2.0 million of dividends were paid in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, on the Series D Preferred Stock. All
    cumulative dividends in arrears were paid February 15, 2007.

Contractual Obligations.

The following table
    outlines the material obligations under long-term debt,
    operating lease and other contractual commitments on
    December 31, 2007

(in millions)

. Typically, payments
    for operating leases, other contractual obligations and interest
    on long-term debt are funded through operating cash flows.
    Principal payment obligations on long-term debt are typically
    refinanced by issuing new long-term debt. If operating cash
    flows are not sufficient, funds received from other sources,
    including borrowings under revolving credit facilities and
    proceeds from property and other asset dispositions might also
    be available.



These obligations are customary transactions similar to those
    entered into by others in the transportation industry. KCS
    anticipates refinancing certain parts of the long-term debt
    prior to maturity.

    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

The Company is party to five utilization leases covering 987
    railcars where car hire revenue as defined in the lease
    agreements is shared between the lessor and the Company. The
    leases expire at various times through 2015. Amounts that may be
    due to lessors under these utilization leases vary from month to
    month based on car hire rental with the minimum monthly cost to
    the Company being zero. Accordingly, the utilization leases have
    been excluded from contractual obligations above.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

As further described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

KCSR holds a fifty percent interest in Southern Capital.
    Southern Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition
    and leasing of equipment including locomotives, rolling stock
    and other railroad equipment. On June 25, 2002, Southern
    Capital partially refinanced the outstanding balance of certain
    debt through the issuance of 5.7% pass through trust
    certificates secured by all of the locomotives and rolling stock
    owned by Southern Capital and rental payments payable by KCSR
    under the operating leases of the equipment owned by Southern
    Capital. As Southern Capital is a fifty percent owned joint
    venture accounted for under the equity method, this debt is not
    reflected in KCS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets which are
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

KCSR holds a fifty percent interest in PCRC. PCRC, as described
    in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

was awarded a concession to reconstruct and operate the Panama
    Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad that provides international container shipping
    companies with a railway transportation option across the
    Isthmus of Panama.

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of
    $100 million of 7% Senior Secured Notes due November
    2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior obligations
    of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. KCSR has pledged its
    shares of PCRC as security for the Notes. The Notes are
    otherwise non-recourse to KCS. The Company has agreed to
    indemnify Mi-Jack Products, Inc, (“Mi-Jack”), the
    other 50% owner of PCRC, for half of any claims made on a
    $9.6 million letter of credit obtained by Mi-Jack to
    partially fund a debt service reserve account and to fund a
    liquidity account, each of which was established by PCRC in
    connection with the issuance of the Notes. The Company is also a
    guarantor for approximately $0.3 million of



an equipment loan and has issued four irrevocable standby
    letters of credit totaling approximately $3.0 million to
    fulfill the Company’s fifty percent guarantee of other
    equipment loans at PCRC.

Capital
    Expenditures.

Capital improvements for track structure and other road property
    have historically been funded with cash flows from operations;
    however during 2005, KCS used borrowings under its revolving
    credit facility to fund an expanded capital expenditure program.
    KCS has historically used internally generated cash flows or
    lease financing for equipment acquisition.

The following table summarizes cash capital expenditures by type
    for the consolidated operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and KCSR and
    Mexrail for the year ended 2005, including KCSM for the last
    nine months of 2005

KCS has one current shelf registration statement on file with
    the SEC (the “Universal Shelf” —
    Registration

No. 333-130112).

The Universal Shelf was filed on December 2, 2005 in
    accordance with the securities offering reform rules of the SEC
    that allow “well-known seasoned issuers” to register
    an unspecified amount of different types of securities on an
    immediately effective

Form S-3

registration statement. The Universal Shelf will expire on
    December 2, 2008. On December 9, 2005, the Company
    completed the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its
    Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the Universal Shelf.
    There remains an unspecified amount of securities available
    under the Universal Shelf.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’ accounting and financial reporting policies are in
    conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Management believes that the following
    accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
    understanding of KCS’ historical and future performance.
    Management has discussed the development and selection of the
    following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
    of KCS’ Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has
    reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of the
    Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates.

Capitalization
    and Depreciation of Property and Equipment.

Due to the extremely capital intensive nature of the railroad
    industry, maintenance and depreciation of property and equipment
    is a substantial operating expense for KCS and the railroad
    industry as a whole. KCS capitalizes costs relating to additions
    and replacements of property and equipment, including certain
    overhead costs representing the indirect costs associated with
    capital projects. Overhead factors are periodically reviewed and
    adjusted to reflect current costs using the full absorption
    method. Overhead costs are depreciated using the mass asset
    group method of accounting consistent with industry standards
    and rules established by the STB.

The cost of property and equipment normally retired, less
    salvage value, is charged to depreciation expense over the
    estimated life of the operating assets using asset group
    straight-line rates. The STB approves the depreciation rates
    used by KCSR (excluding the amortization of computer software)
    but not for KCSM. Both KCSR and KCSM periodically conduct
    studies of depreciation rates for property and equipment and
    implements appropriate changes. These processes for KCSR and
    KCSM substantially conform with each other.

These studies take into consideration the historical retirement
    experience of homogeneous assets within a certain category of
    group assets (e.g., ties, rail, box cars, covered hoppers,
    etc.), the current condition of assets, past and current
    maintenance practices, potential changes in technology and
    maintenance, estimated salvage value, and industry regulations.
    For all other consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is derived
    based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value
    using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
    of the assets.

Depreciation for property and equipment is based upon estimates
    of the useful lives of assets as well as their net salvage value
    at the end of their useful lives. Estimation of the useful lives
    of assets that are long-lived as well as their salvage value
    requires significant management judgment. Accordingly,
    management believes that accounting estimates related to
    depreciation expense are critical.

Currently, KCSR and KCSM depreciate property and equipment and
    capitalized leases generally over a range of 3 to 50 years
    depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset or
    asset group. In addition to the adjustment to rates as a result
    of the depreciation studies, certain other events could occur
    that would materially affect the Company’s estimates and
    assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in
    operations or technology could substantially alter
    management’s assumptions regarding KCS’ ability to
    realize the return of its investment in operating assets and,
    therefore, affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge
    against both current and future revenues.



Because depreciation expense is a function of statistical
    studies made of property, plant and equipment, subsequent
    studies could result in different estimates of useful lives and
    net salvage values. If future depreciation studies yield results
    indicating that the assets have shorter lives as a result of
    obsolescence, physical condition, changes in technology or
    changes in net salvage values, the estimate of depreciation
    expense could increase. Likewise, if future studies indicate
    that assets have longer lives, the estimate of depreciation
    expense could decrease.

KCSR Depreciation Review.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, KCSR engaged a civil engineering
    firm to assist management in evaluating depreciation rates for
    property and equipment. The study centered on evaluating
    historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
    indicated that KCSR was depreciating its property over shorter
    periods than the assets were actually used. The effect of this
    change in estimate was a $3.0 million decrease in
    depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the mass asset group
    depreciation method for consistency with KCSR. In order to
    assist management with the change to the group method, KCSM
    engaged a civil engineering firm to conduct a study of
    depreciation rates for property and equipment. The study
    centered on evaluating historical replacement patterns to assess
    future lives and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its
    property over shorter periods than the assets were actually
    used. As a result, depreciation expense recorded in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 reflected an adjustment totaling
    $5.5 million, to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in
    the second and third quarter of 2005. Unlike KCSR, KCSM
    depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the STB
    and the changes to the depreciation rates, as a result of the
    study, were applied in 2005. Concession rights and related
    assets are amortized over the useful lives as determined by the
    KCSM depreciation study.

Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $160.2 million. A one percent
    change in the average life of all group assets would result in a
    $1.4 million change to the Company’s depreciation
    expense.

Provision for Environmental Remediation.

As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

the Company’s operations are subject to extensive federal,
    state and local environmental laws and regulations in the
    U.S. and Mexico. KCS conducts studies, as well as site
    surveys, to determine the extent of environmental remediation
    necessary to clean up a site. These studies incorporate the
    analysis of internal and external environmental engineering
    staff and consultation with legal counsel. From these studies
    and surveys, a range of estimates of the costs involved is
    derived. These cost estimates are based on forecasts of the
    total future direct costs related to environmental remediation
    and change periodically as additional or better information
    becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required,
    if any. KCS accrues for the cost of remediation where the
    obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably
    estimated.

Cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies
    related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
    and anticipated cost. Certain changes could occur that would
    materially affect management’s estimates and assumptions
    related to costs for environmental remediation. If KCS becomes
    subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at
    known sites, discovers additional contamination, discovers
    previously unknown sites, or becomes subject to related personal
    or property damage, KCS could incur additional costs that could
    be significant in connection with its environmental remediation.
    Accordingly, management believes that estimates related to the
    accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to
    KCS’ results of operations.

Environmental remediation expense was $7.4 million and
    $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    and 2006, respectively and was included in casualties and
    insurance expense on the consolidated statements of income.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2007, KCS had a liability
    for environmental remediation of $9.9 million. KCS’
    environmental liabilities are not discounted. This amount was
    derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5
    “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“SFAS 5”). For



purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the
    December 31, 2007 environmental reserve was adjusted
    (increased or decreased) by 10%, environmental expense would
    change by $0.9 million.

Provision
    for Casualty Claims.

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
    personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
    crossing collisions and derailments, as well as claims related
    to personal property damage and other casualties is a
    substantial expense to KCS. Claims are estimated and recorded
    for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not
    reported (“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent with the
    general practice within the railroad industry, the estimated
    liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined
    on an undiscounted basis. In estimating the liability for
    casualty claims, KCS bases the estimate on an updated study of
    casualty reserves, which calculates an estimate using historical
    experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous
    assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an
    estimate of future claim costs.

Personal injury and other casualty claims are subject to a
    significant degree of uncertainty, especially estimates related
    to incurred but not reported personal injuries for which a party
    has yet to assert a claim. In deriving an estimate of the
    provision for casualty claims, management must make assumptions
    related to substantially uncertain matters (injury severity,
    claimant age and legal jurisdiction). Changes in the assumptions
    used for actuarial studies could have a material effect on the
    estimate of the provision for casualty claims. The most
    sensitive assumptions for personal injury accruals are the
    expected average cost per claim and the projected frequency
    rates for the number of claims that will ultimately result in
    payment. Management believes that the accounting estimate
    related to the liability for personal injuries and other
    casualty claims is critical to KCS’ results of operations.
    See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Based on the methods described above and information available
    as of December 31, 2007, the liability for personal injury
    casualty claims was $90.0 million. A 5% increase or
    decrease in either the expected average cost per claim or the
    frequency rate for claims with payments would result in an
    approximate $4.5 million increase or decrease in the
    Company’s recorded personal injury reserves.

For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, casualty
    expense equaled $55.0 million and $33.8 million,
    respectively, and was included in casualties and insurance
    expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Provision
    for Income Taxes.

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of KCS.
    For financial reporting purposes, management determines the
    current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of
    accounting for income taxes as specified in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” The provision for income taxes is the sum of
    income taxes both currently payable and deferred into the
    future. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability
    related to KCS’ U.S., state and Mexican income tax returns
    for the current year and anticipated tax payments resulting from
    income tax audits while the net deferred tax expense or benefit
    represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or
    liabilities as reported on the balance sheet. The changes in
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon
    the changes in differences between the basis of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of
    assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured using the
    enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect
    when these differences reverse. In addition, the tax provision
    for Mexico is further complicated by the impacts of inflation as
    well as the exchange rate, both of which can have a significant
    impact on the calculation. In addition to estimating the future
    tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences,
    management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether
    tax differences are permanent or temporary. If the differences
    are temporary, management must estimate the timing of their
    reversal, and whether taxable operating income in future periods
    will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax
    assets of KCS. Accordingly, management believes that the
    estimate related to the provision for income taxes are critical
    to the Company’s results of operations.



For the year ended December 31, 2007, income tax expense
    totaled $67.1 million. For every 1% change in the 2007
    effective rate, income tax expense would have changed by
    $2.2 million. For every 1% change in the Mexican inflation
    rate the tax expense would increase or decrease by
    $4.6 million. If the exchange rate used at the end of 2007
    changed by 10 cents from 10.87 Mexican pesos to each
    U.S. dollar to 10.77 pesos per dollar, the tax expense
    would have decreased by $1.4 million.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are
    of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
    Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
    current and former employees for job related injuries and by
    third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS
    aggressively defends these matters and has established liability
    reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected
    costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any
    legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s
    management, other than those proceedings described in
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition.

Inflation.

U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles require the use of historical cost, which
    does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement
    cost of property. Due to the capital intensive nature of
    KCS’ business, the replacement cost of these assets would
    be significantly larger than the amounts reported under the
    historical cost basis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Refer to
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for information relative to recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures Concerning Market Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
    inherent market risks, but these instruments have not been
    entered into for trading purposes. The following information,
    together with information included in Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 12 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that
    have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Floating-rate
    indebtedness totaled $487.1 million and $381.6 million
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Two credit
    agreements, each comprised of a revolving credit facility and a
    term loan facility, contain variable rate debt which accrues
    interest based on target interest indexes (London Interbank
    Offered Rate — “LIBOR” or an alternative
    base rate) plus an applicable spread, as set forth in each
    credit agreement. Given the balance of $487.1 million of
    variable rate debt at December 31, 2007, KCS is sensitive
    to fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical
    100 basis points increase in each of the respective target
    interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of
    $4.9 million on an annualized basis for the floating-rate
    instruments issued by the Company as of December 31, 2007.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of debt was approximately
    $1,771.8 million at December 31, 2007 and
    $1,814.1 million at December 31, 2006, compared with a
    carrying value of $1,755.9 million and
    $1,757.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Commodity Price Sensitivity.

As described in
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Other
    Matters — Derivative Instruments” of this

Form 10-K,

KCS periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment
    and swap transactions. At December 31, 2007, KCS did not
    have any outstanding fuel swap agreements. The Company also
    holds fuel inventories for use in operations. These inventories
    are not material to KCS’ overall financial position. Fuel
    costs are expected to mirror market conditions in 2008, however,
    fuel cost are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors
    outside the Company’s control. KCS also cushions the impact
    of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge



revenues from customers. Assuming annual consumption of
    140 million gallons, a 10 cent change in the price per
    gallon of fuel would cause a $14.0 million change in
    operating expenses.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity.

KCSM uses the
    dollar as its functional currency. Earnings from KCSM included
    in the Company’s results of operations reflect revaluation
    gains and losses that KCSM records in the process of translating
    certain transactions from pesos to dollars. Therefore, the
    Company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso.
    While not currently utilizing foreign currency instruments to
    hedge KCS’ dollar investment in KCSM, existing alternatives
    are evaluated as market conditions and exchange rates fluctuate.
    For example, a hypothetical 10% increase in the US dollar to the
    Mexican peso exchange rate on net monetary assets of
    Ps.1,325.7 million would result in a translation loss of
    approximately $11.1 million and a 10% decrease in the
    exchange rate would result in a translation gain of
    approximately $13.5 million.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

KCS’ internal control over financial reporting was designed
    to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the framework established by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

(commonly referred to as the COSO framework).
    Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria
    outlined in the COSO framework.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which
    immediately follows this report.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited Kansas City Southern’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Kansas City
    Southern’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A
    company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Kansas City Southern maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Kansas City Southern as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our
    report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2007. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Kansas City Southern’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

As discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

, effective January 1, 2007.

Note 1.

Description
    of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
    “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was initially
    organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. In
    2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas City
    Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal operations in
    rail transportation.

KCS operates under two reportable business segments, which are
    currently defined geographically as United States (U.S.) and
    Mexico. As the KCS rail network and other processes continue to
    coordinate as a network system, KCS will continue to evaluate
    its segment reporting. In both the U.S. and the Mexico
    segments, the Company generates revenues and cash flows by
    providing its customers with freight delivery services both
    within its regions, and throughout North America through
    connections with other Class I rail carriers. KCS’
    customers conduct business in a number of different industries,
    including electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum
    products, paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral
    products, automotive products and intermodal transportation.

KCS’ principal geographic business segments currently
    include the following:

U.S.
    Segment.

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a
    wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary;

•

Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”), a wholly-owned consolidated
    subsidiary; which wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”);

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy-six
    percent owned consolidated affiliate.

Combined with equity investments in:

•

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), a fifty percent
    owned unconsolidated affiliate which owns all of the common
    stock of Panarail Tourism Company (“Panarail”);

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that owns and leases locomotives and other rail equipment.

Mexico
    Segment.

•

Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“KCSM”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary which operates
    under the rights granted by the Concession acquired from the
    Mexican government in 1997 (“the Concession”) as
    described below;

•

Arrendadora KCSM, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Arrendadora”),
    a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, with KCSM holding
    ninety-eight percent ownership and KCSM Holdings LLC, a 100%
    owned KCSM subsidiary, owning the remaining two percent. It is
    responsible for leasing to KCSM the locomotives and freight cars
    acquired through the privatization of KCSM and subsequently sold
    to Arrendadora by KCSM;

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

KCS completed its acquisition of control of Grupo KCSM, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as Grupo
    Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or Grupo
    TFM on April 1, 2005, and Grupo KCSM became a consolidated
    subsidiary of KCS. On September 12, 2005, the Company and
    its subsidiaries, Grupo KCSM and KCSM, the Mexican holding
    company Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”), entered into a
    settlement agreement with the Mexican government resolving the
    controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
    government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
    the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM owned by the Mexican
    government (the “Vat/Put Settlement”). As a result of
    this settlement, KCS wholly owns Grupo KCSM and KCSM. Grupo KCSM
    was merged with KCSM effective May 8, 2007. KCSM
    constituted 51% of consolidated assets at December 31, 2007
    and 47% of 2007 consolidated revenues.

The KCSM Concession.

KCSM holds a Concession
    from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusive through
    2027, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to
    other concessionaires) which is renewable under certain
    conditions for additional periods of up to 50 years. The
    Concession is to provide freight transportation services over
    rail lines which are a primary commercial corridor of the
    Mexican railroad system. These lines include the shortest, most
    direct rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas and
    serve most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and
    three of its major shipping ports. KCSM has the right to use,
    but does not own, all track and buildings that are necessary for
    the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is obligated to maintain
    the right of way, track structure, buildings and related
    maintenance facilities to the operational standards specified in
    the concession agreement and to return the assets in that
    condition at the end of the Concession period. KCSM is required
    to pay the Mexican government a concession duty equal to 0.5% of
    gross revenues during the first 15 years of the concession
    period and 1.25% of such revenues during the remainder of the
    period.

Under the Concession and Mexican law, the Company may freely set
    rates unless the Mexican government determines that there is no
    effective competition in Mexico’s rail industry. KCSM is
    required to register its rates with the Mexican government and
    to provide railroad services to all users on a fair and
    non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and
    safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican
    government. In the event that rates charged are higher than the
    registered rates, KCSM must reimburse customers with interest,
    and risk the revocation of the Concession.

Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations and the Concession
    establish several circumstances under which the Concession will
    terminate: revocation by the Mexican government, statutory
    appropriation, or KCSM’s voluntary surrender of its rights
    or liquidation or bankruptcy. The Concession requires the
    undertaking of capital projects, including those described in a
    business plan filed every five years with the Mexican
    government. KCSM filed its third business plan with the Mexican
    government in December 2007 in which KCSM committed to certain
    minimal investment and capital improvement goals, which may be
    waived by the Mexican government upon application for relief for
    good cause. Mexico may also revoke KCSM’s exclusivity after
    2017 if it determines that there is insufficient competition.

The Concession is subject to early termination or revocation
    under certain circumstances. In the event that the Concession is
    revoked by the Mexican government, KCSM will receive no
    compensation. Rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the
    Concession, as well as all improvements made by KCSM or third
    parties, will revert to the Mexican government. All other
    property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause KCSM to lease all service-related assets to it for a
    term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will have a right of first refusal with respect to
    certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after any revocation of the Concession. The Mexican
    government may also temporarily seize the rail lines and assets
    used in operating the rail lines in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbances, or imminent
    danger to the domestic peace or economy for the duration of any
    of the foregoing events; provided, however, that Mexican law
    requires that the Mexican government pay KCSM compensation equal
    to damages caused and losses suffered if it effects a statutory
    appropriation for reasons of the public interest. These payments
    may not be sufficient to compensate the Company for its losses
    and may not be timely made.

Employees and Labor Relations.

Labor relations
    in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

are renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open
    for modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s
    procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and
    the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted.
    Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take
    place over an extended period of time, and the Company rarely
    experiences work stoppages during negotiations. Wages, health
    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have
    traditionally been addressed during negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carrier’s Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees has been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated on November 1, 2004. Long
    term settlement agreements were reached during 2007 covering
    approximately 60% of KCSR’s unionized work force through
    January 1, 2010 and have not had a material impact on the
    consolidated financial statements. Negotiations continue with
    the two remaining unions representing the remaining KCSR union
    employees and are expected to conclude in 2008 under similar
    terms to the 2007 settlements. The Company anticipates that the
    expected settlements in 2008 will not have a material impact to
    the consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997 between KCSM and the Sindicato
    de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana
    (Mexican Railroad Union), for a term of 50 years, for the
    purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties and
    improving conditions for the union employees. Approximately 80%
    of the Company’s employees are covered by this labor
    agreement. The compensation terms under this labor agreement are
    subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms
    are renegotiated every two years. The compensation terms and
    other benefits are currently being renegotiated and KCSM expects
    to finalize these terms during the first quarter of 2008. The
    union labor negotiation with the Mexican Railroad Union has not
    historically resulted in any strike, boycott, or other
    disruption in KCSM’s business operations. KCSM anticipates
    that the expected settlements in 2008 will not have a material
    impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements are presented using the
    accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
    majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
    year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
    which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
    influence, but not a controlling interest. The Company evaluates
    less than majority owned investments for consolidation pursuant
    to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003). The Company
    does not have any less than majority owned investments requiring
    consolidation.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
    of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business
    combination. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the goodwill
    balance was $10.6 million which is included in other assets
    in the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill and intangible
    assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are
    reviewed at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss
    would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount
    exceeds the assets’ fair value. Intangible assets with
    estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
    over their respective useful lives. During 2007 and 2006, the
    Company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill and
    concluded there was no impairment in either year.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial
    reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
    statements



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Significant items subject to such estimates and
    assumptions include those related to the recoverability and
    useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation,
    environmental remediation, casualty claims, and the valuation of
    share-based compensation and deferred tax assets. Changes in
    facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Currency Translation.

For tax purposes, KCSM
    and its subsidiaries are required to maintain their books and
    records in Mexican pesos. For financial reporting purposes, KCSM
    and its subsidiaries maintain records in U.S. dollars,
    which is the functional currency. The dollar is the currency
    that reflects the economic substance of the underlying events
    and circumstances relevant to the entity (i.e., historical cost
    convention). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    pesos are translated into dollars using current exchange rates.
    The difference between the exchange rate on the date of the
    transaction and the exchange rate on the settlement date, or
    balance sheet date if not settled, is included in the income
    statement as foreign exchange gain or loss.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    freight revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a
    commodity movement as a shipment moves from origin to
    destination, with the related expense recognized as incurred.
    Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the product is
    shipped, as services are performed or contractual obligations
    fulfilled.

Cash Equivalents.

Short term liquid
    investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
    when purchased are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable
    are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined
    by historical experience and adjusted for economic uncertainties
    or known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance when a
    customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has been transferred
    to a collection agent or submitted for legal action, or when a
    customer is significantly past due and all available means of
    collection have been exhausted. At December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $9.7 million
    and $31.4 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, accounts receivable allowance recovery
    was $2.3 million. Bad debt expense was $10.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Restricted Funds

—

JSIB
    Consulting.

In connection with KCS’
    acquisition of the controlling interest in KCSM, KCS entered
    into a three year consulting agreement with José F. Serrano
    International Business, S.A. de C.V. (“JSIB”), a
    consulting company controlled by José Serrano, Chairman of
    the Board of TMM. Under this agreement, JSIB provided consulting
    services to KCS in connection with its Mexico business and
    received an annual fee of $3.0 million. The consulting
    agreement required KCS to deposit the total amount of annual
    fees payable under the agreement ($9.0 million) in cash to
    be held and released in accordance with the consulting
    agreement. As of December 31, 2006, the balance in
    restricted funds was $6.0 million. In February 2007, KCS
    paid $3.0 million and on October 1, 2007, the final
    $3.0 million fee was released. See

Settlement Agreement
    with TMM

in Note 4 for further discussion of the
    settlement.

Restricted Funds — MSLLC.

On
    December 1, 2005, KCS and KCSR entered into a transaction
    agreement with Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) and
    its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad
    Company (“AGS”), providing for the formation of a
    limited liability company between the parties relating to the
    ownership and improvement of the KCSR rail line between
    Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the
    portion of the KCSR rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian
    known as the “Meridian Speedway”.

In connection with the formation of MSLLC, NS, through AGS,
    contributed $100.0 million to MSLLC, representing the
    initial NS investment in the joint venture. MSLLC commenced
    operations on May 1, 2006. Of NS’ initial investment,
    $76.5 million was distributed to KCS as reimbursement for
    capital expenditures



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

incurred and paid by KCS for MSLLC during 2006. KCS classified
    the remaining balance of $23.5 million, as funds restricted
    for payment of MSLLC capital assets at December 31, 2006.
    NS has contributed an additional $143.4 million as of
    December 31, 2007 of which, a net $129.1 million has
    been paid as reimbursement for capital expenditures and other
    operating expenses. During 2007, $26.3 million of the
    restricted funds was classified as investments with the
    remaining balance of $11.5 million as funds restricted for
    payment of MSLLC capital assets at December 31, 2007.
    Substantially all of these funds will be used for capital
    improvements on the Meridian Speedway. NS has a binding
    commitment to fund additional cash contributions of
    $56.6 million, subject to the terms of the transaction
    agreement, reflecting an ultimate ownership of 30% in MSLLC,
    once fully funded.

Inventories.

Inventories consisting of diesel
    fuel, items to be used in the maintenance of rolling stock and
    items to be used in the maintenance or construction of road
    property are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Derivative Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended,
    requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet as
    either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives are recorded either through
    current earnings or as other comprehensive income, depending on
    hedge designation. Gains and losses on derivative instruments
    classified as cash flow hedges are reported in other
    comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the
    periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the
    cash flow of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all
    hedge transactions is recognized in current period earnings.

Concession Rights and Related Assets.

Costs
    incurred by the Company to acquire the Concession rights and
    related assets were capitalized and are amortized over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets and rights
    acquired. Concession replacements and improvements are stated at
    cost. Major repairs and track rehabilitation are capitalized.
    Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method based
    on the estimated useful lives of the respective improvements.

The ranges of annual depreciation rates for financial statement
    purposes are 2% — 7% for track structure and other
    roadway property.

Property and Depreciation.

Property is stated
    at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions and
    improvements, including those on leased assets that increase the
    life or utility of the asset, are capitalized and all property
    is depreciated over the estimated useful life or lease term of
    such assets. The Company capitalizes certain overhead costs
    representing the indirect costs associated with construction and
    improvement projects using the full absorption method. Overhead
    factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect
    current costs. Depreciation for property and equipment is
    derived using the mass asset group-life method. This method
    groups numerous homogeneous assets into depreciable categories
    (e.g., rail, ties, ballast, locomotives, work equipment) and
    depreciates these assets as a whole. Repairs and maintenance
    costs are charged to expense as incurred.

The ranges of annual depreciation rates for financial statement
    purposes are: track structure and other roadway
    property — 1% to 9%, rolling stock and
    equipment — 1% to 14%, computer software —
    8% to 33%, and capitalized leases — 6% to 25%.

The cost of track structure, other roadway property, and
    equipment normally retired, less salvage value, is charged to
    accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The
    cost of property abnormally retired, together with accumulated
    depreciation thereon, is eliminated from the property accounts
    and the related gains or losses are reflected in net income.
    Gains or losses recognized on the sale of non-operating property
    reflected in other income are not material for the periods
    presented.

KCSR Depreciation Review.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, KCSR engaged a civil engineering
    firm to assist management in evaluating depreciation rates for
    property and equipment. The study centered on evaluating
    historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
    indicated that KCSR was depreciating its property over shorter
    periods than the assets were actually used. The effect of this
    change in estimate was a $3.0 million decrease in
    depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the mass asset group
    depreciation method for consistency with KCSR. In order to
    assist management with the change to the group method, KCSM
    engaged a civil engineering firm to conduct a study of
    depreciation rates for property and equipment. The study
    centered on evaluating historical replacement patterns to assess
    future lives and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its
    property over shorter periods than the assets were actually
    used. As a result, depreciation expense recorded in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 reflected an adjustment totaling
    $5.5 million, to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in
    the second and third quarter of 2005. Unlike KCSR, KCSM
    depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the STB
    and the changes to the depreciation rates, as a result of the
    study, were applied in 2005. Concession rights and related
    assets are amortized over the useful lives as determined by the
    KCSM depreciation study.

Computer Software Costs.

Costs incurred in
    conjunction with the purchase or development of computer
    software for internal use is capitalized. Costs incurred in the
    preliminary project stage, as well as training and maintenance
    costs, are expensed as incurred. Direct and indirect costs
    associated with the application development stage of internal
    use software are capitalized until such time that the software
    is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.
    Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the useful life of the software.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

The Company
    reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and
    the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying cost of the long-lived assets, the carrying cost is
    reduced to the estimated value as measured by the discounted
    cash flows. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 there were no
    impairment indicators present.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, lease and contract
    receivables, accounts payable, and long-term debt as described
    in Note 6.

The financial statement carrying value of the Company’s
    cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term
    nature. Carrying value approximates fair value for all financial
    instruments with six months or less to re-pricing or maturity
    and for financial instruments with variable interest rates. The
    Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt based upon
    borrowing rates available at the reporting date for indebtedness
    with similar terms and average maturities. Based upon the
    borrowing rates currently available to the Company and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was
    $1,771.8 million and $1,814.1 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The financial
    statement carrying value was $1,755.9 million and
    $1,757.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company records
    liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to
    past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future
    expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to
    their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation
    costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
    receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance
    activities related to current operations are expensed as
    incurred.

Casualty Claims.

Casualty claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
    amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
    The Company’s casualty liability reserve is based on
    actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted basis. The
    reserve is based on claims filed and an



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While the
    ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
    factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
    liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims.
    Adjustments to the liability will be reflected as operating
    expenses in the period in which the adjustments are known. Legal
    fees related to casualty claims are recorded in operating
    expense in the period incurred.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.

The
    Company provides certain medical, life and other postretirement
    benefits to certain active employees and retirees. The Company
    uses actuaries to assist management in estimating liabilities
    and expenses for pension and other post retirement benefits.
    Estimated amounts are based on current and historical
    information, current information and estimates regarding future
    events and circumstances. Significant assumptions used in the
    valuation of pension and other postretirement liabilities
    include the discount rate, rate of increase in compensation
    levels and the health care cost trend rate.

KCSM Employees’ Statutory Profit
    Sharing.

KCSM is subject to employee statutory
    profit sharing requirements under Mexican law and calculates
    profit sharing liability as 10% of KCSM net taxable income,
    adjusted as prescribed by the Mexican income tax law. In
    calculating its net taxable income for statutory profit sharing
    purposes, KCSM previously deducted NOL carryforwards. The
    application of NOL carryforwards can result in a deferred profit
    sharing asset for a given period rather than a profit sharing
    liability. Due to decisions by the Mexican Supreme Court in 2005
    declaring that NOLs from previous years may not be deducted,
    KCSM changed the method of calculating its statutory profit
    sharing liability. KCSM no longer deducts NOLs from prior years
    when calculating employee statutory profit sharing. This change
    required KCSM to write off its deferred tax assets related to
    statutory profit sharing resulting in a charge to operating
    expenses of $35.6 million in 2005.

Share-Based Compensation.

Effective
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (Revised)
    “Share-Based Payments” (“SFAS 123R”)
    and accounts for all share-based compensation in accordance with
    the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. Under
    this method, compensation expense is measured at grant date
    based on the then fair value of the award and is recognized over
    the requisite service period in which the award is earned. The
    Company elected to adopt SFAS 123R on a modified
    prospective basis requiring that all new awards and modified
    awards after the effective date and any unvested awards at the
    effective date be recognized as compensation cost ratably over
    the option vesting period. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures
    to be estimated at the time of the grant and revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods should actual forfeitures
    differ from those estimates. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements for prior years have not been restated to
    reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted
    for share-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and followed the
    pro forma disclosure requirements set forth in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
    Under this method, compensation expense was recognized ratably
    over the option vesting period if an option exercise price was
    less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant.
    KCS’ practice was to set the option exercise price equal to
    the market price of the stock at the date of grant; therefore,
    no compensation expense was recognized for financial reporting
    purposes.

    The Company does not intend to repurchase any shares in 2008 to
    provide shares to issue as share-based awards; however,
    management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the
    level of shares outstanding.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of
    transactions reported in different periods for financial
    reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method
    gives consideration to the future tax consequences of the
    deferred income tax items and immediately recognizes changes in
    income tax laws upon enactment.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in KCSM on
    April 1, 2005, KCSM provided deferred income taxes for the
    difference between the financial reporting and income tax bases
    of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its proportionate
    share of these income taxes through its equity in KCSM’s
    earnings. Since April 1, 2005, KCSM income taxes are
    reflected in the consolidated results. Although KCSM has
    generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due primarily
    to the accelerated tax amortization of the concession rights.
    The Company has recognized a deferred income tax asset for the
    resulting net operating loss carryforwards. Management
    anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
    realized given the long carryforward period (through the year
    2046) for amortization of the Concession, as well as the
    fact that KCSM is expected to generate taxable income in the
    future. The Company’s tax projections take into
    consideration certain assumptions, some of which are under its
    control and others which are not. Key assumptions include
    inflation rates, currency fluctuations, future income and future
    capital expenditures. If the assumptions are not correct, a
    valuation allowance may have to be recognized on the deferred
    tax asset.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in KCSM on
    April 1, 2005, the Company did not provide
    U.S. federal income taxes for the temporary difference
    between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of
    its investment in KCSM because KCSM was a foreign corporate
    joint venture that was considered permanent in duration, and the
    Company did not expect the reversal of the temporary difference
    to occur in the foreseeable future. Following the acquisition of
    control of KCSM in 2005, the Company has not provided
    U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
    KCSM since the Company intends to reinvest such earnings
    indefinitely in the Mexican operations.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per common
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
    the potential dilution that could occur if convertible
    securities were converted into

SFAS 157.

In September 2006, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”)
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value, and enhances disclosures about fair value
    measurements. This Statement applies when other accounting
    pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements; it
    does not require new fair value measurements. The Company is
    required to adopt SFAS 157 prospectively beginning on
    January 1, 2008, except for certain financial instruments.
    Any transition adjustment will be recognized as an adjustment to
    opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. In November
    of 2007, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of
    SFAS 157’s fair value measurement requirement for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required or
    permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring

basis. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of
    SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its results of
    operations and financial condition.

SFAS 159.

In February of 2007, the FASB
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 115” (“SFAS 159”), which permits
    entities to choose to measure most financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. It also establishes financial statement
    presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and
    liabilities reported at fair value as a consequence of the
    election. This Statement is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
    The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of
    SFAS 159 will have a material impact on its results of
    operations and financial condition.

EITF 06-10.

In
    March of 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force

06-10

“Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life
    Insurance Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-10”),

effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007.

EITF 06-10

provides guidance for measuring the asset associated with
    collateral-assignment split-dollar life insurance based on the
    arrangement’s terms. A Company would record a liability for
    a postretirement benefit only if the Company has agreed to
    maintain the life insurance policy during the employee’s
    retirement or provide the employee with a death benefit. The
    Company does not anticipate that the adoption of

EITF 06-10

will have a material impact on its results of operations and
    financial condition.

SFAS 160.

In December of 2007, the FASB
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements” (“SFAS 160”), which is effective
    for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests, previously
    referred to as minority interests, to be treated as a separate
    component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of
    permanent equity and applies to the accounting for
    noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling
    interest holders in consolidated financial statements.
    SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively to all
    noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the
    effective date except that comparative period information must
    be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity,
    attributed net income and other comprehensive income to
    noncontrolling interests, and provide other disclosures required
    by SFAS 160. The Company does not anticipate that the
    adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on its
    results of operations and financial condition.

Panama
    Canal Railway Company.

PCRC, a joint venture company owned equally by KCS and Mi-Jack
    Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession
    from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the
    Panama Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international container shipping companies with a railway
    transportation option in lieu of the Panama Canal. The
    concession was awarded in 1998 for an

initial term of 25 years with an automatic renewal for an
    additional 25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a
    north-south railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between
    the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. PCRC’s Panarail subsidiary
    operates and promotes commuter and tourist passenger service
    over the Panama Canal Railway.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had invested
    $31.5 million ($12.9 million of equity and
    $18.6 million of subordinated loans) toward the
    reconstruction and operations of the Panama Canal Railway. The
    loans carried a 10% interest rate and were payable on demand,
    subject to certain restrictions. On November 2, 2007, PCRC
    paid $26.3 million to the Company to repay the principal
    and accrued interest of the subordinated loans and advances made
    to PCRC.

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of
    $100.0 million of 7% Senior Secured Notes due November
    2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior obligations
    of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. In addition, the
    Company has pledged its shares of PCRC as security for the
    Notes. The Notes are otherwise non-recourse to the Company. In
    connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to
    indemnify

Mi-Jack

for
    50% of any claims made on a $9.6 million letter of credit
    obtained by Mi-Jack to partially fund a debt service reserve
    account and to fund a liquidity account, each of which was
    established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the Notes.

A portion of the proceeds of the Notes was used by PCRC to repay
    the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the senior
    debt held by the International Finance Corporation
    (“IFC”), which was formerly guaranteed by the partners
    of PCRC. The repayment resulted in the release of the
    Company’s $13.4 million of guaranties of this debt. In
    addition, as previously discussed, the Company received cash
    payments from PCRC totaling $26.3 million to repay the
    principal and accrued interest of the subordinated loans and
    advances made to PCRC by the Company. The remainder of the
    proceeds was used to repay principal and accrued interest on
    subordinated loans and advances made to PCRC by Mi-Jack, to fund
    a portion of the debt service reserve account, to fund a capital
    expenditure account, and to pay fees and expenses associated
    with the offering.

The Company is also a guarantor for approximately
    $0.3 million of an equipment loan and has issued four
    irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling approximately
    $3.0 million to fulfill the Company’s fifty percent
    guarantee of additional PCRC equipment loans.

In December 2007, KCSM and PCRC entered into a loan agreement
    (the “Loan”), pursuant to which KCSM loaned PCRC
    $4.2 million of which $3.8 million is included in
    investments and $0.4 million is included in other current
    assets. The term of the Loan is eight years and bears interest
    at a rate per annum equal to four hundred basis points over the
    British Bankers Association

90-day

LIBOR
    Rate applicable for the quarter. PCRC will pay the principal
    amount in thirty-two equal quarterly payments together with any
    and all corresponding interest, on the last day of March, June,
    September, and December of each year, with the first payment due
    on March 31, 2008. The parties agreed that the maturity of
    the Loan may be extended with the prior written agreement of the
    parties.

In December 2007, KCSM and PCRC entered into a locomotive
    purchase agreement, pursuant to which KCSM will sell to PCRC
    five used SD60 locomotives for $4.2 million. PCRC made an
    advance payment of $4.2 million in December 2007.

Southern
    Capital.

In 1996, the Company and GATX Capital Corporation
    (“GATX”) completed a transaction for the formation and
    financing of a joint venture, Southern Capital. Southern
    Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition of
    locomotives, rolling stock and other railroad equipment and the
    leasing thereof. The Company holds a fifty percent interest in
    Southern Capital, which it accounts for using the equity method
    of accounting.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

KCSR paid Southern Capital $18.6 million,
    $26.5 million, and $30.1 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively, under operating leases. In connection with
    the formation of Southern Capital, the Company received cash
    that exceeded the net book value of assets contributed to the
    joint venture by about $44 million. Accordingly, the excess
    fair value over book value is being recognized as a reduction in
    certain lease rental expenses over the terms of such leases
    equal to $0.2 million, $2.7 million, and
    $3.6 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. In
    2007, Southern Capital paid a dividend in the form of
    locomotives. The Company received 42 locomotives at a fair value
    of $10.3 million. In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company
    received cash dividends of $4.0 million, $4.5 million,
    and $8.3 million, respectively, from Southern Capital.

During 2005, Southern Capital recorded gains of
    $7.7 million related to the sale of locomotives to KCSR. No
    such gains were recorded in 2006. In 2007, Southern Capital
    recorded a gain of $11.3 million related to the locomotive
    dividend. For purposes of recording its share of Southern
    Capital earnings, the Company has recorded its share of the
    gains as a reduction to the cost basis of the equipment
    acquired. As a result, the Company will recognize its equity in
    the gains over the remaining depreciable life of the locomotives
    as a reduction of depreciation expense.

On June 5, 2002, Southern Capital refinanced the
    outstanding balance of a bridge loan through the issuance of
    approximately $167.6 million of 5.7% pass through trust
    certificates and proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. Of
    this amount, $104.0 million was secured by all of the
    locomotives and rolling stock owned by Southern Capital (other
    than the 50 locomotives, which were sold, as discussed below)
    and rental payments payable by KCSR under the operating and
    financing leases of the equipment owned by Southern Capital.
    Payments of interest and principal of the pass through trust
    certificates, which are due semi-annually through 2022, are
    insured under a financial guarantee insurance policy by MBIA
    Insurance Corporation (“MBIA”). KCSR leases or
    subleases all of the equipment securing the pass through
    certificates.

The remaining amount of pass through trust certificates,
    approximately $63.6 million, was assigned to General
    Electric Corporation, the buyer of the 50 locomotives, and is
    secured by the sold locomotives and rental payments payable by
    KCSR under the sublease. Southern Capital does not have the
    option, nor is it obligated to repurchase or redeem the lease
    receivable or related equipment on or prior to the expiration of
    the lease agreement entered into with KCSR at the time of the
    sale. Southern Capital does not guarantee the lease payments of
    KCSR and has no obligation to make such payments if KCSR should
    fail to do so. In the event of default by KCSR, MBIA guarantees
    the outstanding debt and may seize the collateralized assets, or
    find a third party lessee to continue making the rental payments
    to satisfy the debt requirements.

Ferrocarril
    y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico Valley
    Railway and Terminal or “FTVM”).

FTVM provides railroad services as well as ancillary services,
    including those related to interconnection, switching and
    haulage services in the greater Mexico City area. KCSM holds 25%
    of the share capital of FTVM. The other shareholders of FTVM,
    each holding a 25% interest, are Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferromex”), Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferrosur”) and the Mexican government.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
    use portions of its track to Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM, and
    these companies are required to grant KCSM the rights to use
    portions of their tracks.

Other
    Investments

During 2007, the Company invested in a financial institution
    cash management fund for which withdraws have been restricted
    based on the liquidity of the underlying investments. The
    carrying value of the investment is $37.8 million of which
    $11.5 million is included in restricted funds and
    $26.3 million is included in investments on the balance
    sheet as of December 31, 2007. The Company has the ability
    to hold these

investments until maturity; however, subsequent changes in the
    U.S. credit market could negatively impact the
    Company’s investment, the effects of which could be
    material. As of December 31, 2007, the Company believes the
    carrying amount of the investment approximates fair value. In
    January and February of 2008, approximately $12.0 million
    of these investments were liquidated at their carrying value
    plus accrued interest. Scheduled maturities of the investment
    including maturities in January 2008 are as follows:
    $36.2 million mature one year through five years and
    $1.6 million mature five years through ten years.

The Company owns 16.6% of the Kansas City Terminal Railway
    Company, which owns and operates 80 miles of track and
    operates an additional eight miles of track under trackage
    rights in greater Kansas City, Missouri. This investment is
    accounted for under the cost method of accounting and had a
    balance of $3.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and
    $3.5 million as of December 31, 2006.

Acquisitions

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141 “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141”), the Company allocates the purchase
    price of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets
    and liabilities of the acquired entity based on their fair
    values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value is
    recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to acquired
    assets and incurred liabilities are based on valuations prepared
    by independent third party appraisal firms, published market
    prices and management estimates.

Acquisition
    of Controlling Interest in Grupo KCSM.

April 1, 2005 — Acquisition
    Agreement.

In furtherance of the Company’s
    strategy for expansion into Mexico, on December 15, 2004,
    the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Acquisition
    Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with TMM and
    other parties under which KCS acquired full control of KCSM
    through the purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo KCSM. At
    the time, Grupo KCSM held an 80% interest in KCSM and all of the
    shares of stock with full voting rights of KCSM. The remaining
    20% economic interest in KCSM was owned by the Mexican
    government in the form of shares with limited voting rights.

On September 12, 2005, KCS and its subsidiaries, KCSM and
    Grupo KCSM, along with TMM, entered into a settlement agreement
    with the Mexican government, resolving controversies and
    disputes between the companies and the Mexican government
    concerning the VAT Claim and Put. In accordance with the
    Acquisition Agreement under which KCS acquired its controlling
    interest in KCSM, a payment of additional purchase price of
    $99.5 million became payable to TMM as a result of the
    final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put. This amount was paid
    by KCS and recorded as an increase in the equity of KCSM.

The VAT/Put Settlement had two separate impacts —
    first, the resolution of a pre-acquisition contingency related
    to the April 1, 2005 transaction and second, KCSM’s
    acquisition of the minority interest held by the Mexican
    government.

Settlement
    Agreement with TMM

On September 24, 2007, KCS entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Grupo TMM, S.A.B.
    (“TMM”, formerly Grupo TMM, S.A.) TMM Logistics, S.A.
    de C.V., a subsidiary of TMM, and VEX Asesores Corporativos,
    S.A. de C.V. (formerly José F. Serrano International
    Business, S.A. de C.V.) (the “Consulting Firm”),
    resolving certain claims and disputes over liabilities
    established as part of KCS’ acquisition of KCSM (successor
    by merger to Grupo KCSM). Pursuant to the terms of the
    Agreement, KCS agreed to pay TMM $54.1 million in cash to
    retire two notes totaling $86.6 million which were
    negotiated in 2005 at the closing of KCS’ acquisition of
    KCSM to cover certain post-closing contingencies and tax
    liabilities. The parties also agreed to terminate the consulting
    agreement between KCS and the Consulting Firm and make the final
    annual payment of $3.0 million, payable on settlement. The
    settlement amount of $57.1 million was paid by KCS to TMM
    on October 1, 2007.

The tax liability of $33.7 million was established in
    accordance with the Acquisition Agreement as a contingent
    payment for uncertainties related to the tax basis of assets
    acquired that would ultimately be agreed to by the Mexico taxing
    authority. This liability was originally due in 2010; however,
    the Company paid the tax liability in full upon this settlement
    while it was finalizing economic ties with TMM. The indemnity
    liability of $52.9 million was established in accordance
    with the Acquisition Agreement as a potential reduction to the
    purchase price and was subject to indemnification provisions of
    the Acquisition Agreement for certain potential losses related
    to inaccurate representations and warranties, or breaches of
    covenants in the Acquisition Agreement or claims relating
    thereto.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company negotiated the final payment of the purchase price
    in conjunction with the indemnity liability with TMM. The
    Company reduced the liability by $32.5 million to the
    agreed payment of $54.1 million per the settlement
    agreement by recording the following: $2.9 million
    reduction of interest expense, $9.9 million reduction of
    pre-acquisition receivables, and $19.7 million adjustment
    to the purchase accounting assets related to this transaction.

The principal amount of the liabilities recorded at the date of
    acquisition was $78.2 million. These liabilities accrued
    interest expense of $8.4 million from April of 2005 through
    September 2007 at a rate of 5% per year. KCS recorded
    $2.9 million as a reduction of interest expense in the
    income statement representing interest on the difference between
    the original principal and the settlement amount that was
    recorded post acquisition. The settlement agreement was assessed
    to include payment for $9.9 million of pre-acquisition
    receivables that were still outstanding at the time of
    settlement and not reserved for at the acquisition date. As a
    result of the inaccuracies subsequently identified in the
    balance sheet, which was used as the basis for the settlement of
    the purchase price and indemnity provision, the Company
    concluded that certain balance sheet assets and liabilities that
    were acquired were not the assets and liabilities that were
    included in the balance sheet. Based upon all the facts and
    circumstances, there was a clear and direct link to the purchase
    price; therefore, the Company recorded the remainder of the
    $32.5 million difference of $19.7 million as an
    adjustment of the purchase price in accordance with
    SFAS 141 during 2007.

KCS
    Debt.

Debt Obligations Related to KCSM
    Acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition
    of KCSM and the VAT/Put Settlement, the Company recorded a
    $110.0 million liability payable to TMM in 2005. The
    liability was non-interest bearing, therefore it was recorded at
    its present value based on a 5% discount rate. On March 13,
    2006, in settlement of the $110.0 million obligation, KCS
    paid $35 million in cash, issued 1,494,469 shares of
    KCS common stock at the VWAP of $23.4197, as determined by the
    Acquisition Agreement (as presented in the consolidated
    statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income), and issued a $40 million five-year
    non-interest bearing note. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company recorded a non-current liability of $32.4 million
    which would accrete at 5% annually until paid.

Also, as part of the acquisition in 2005, KCS issued escrow
    notes totaling $47.0 million which were subject to
    reduction for certain potential losses related to breaches of
    certain representations, warranties or covenants in the
    Acquisition Agreement by TMM. The escrow notes were due
    April 1, 2007, and accrued interest at a stated rate of
    5.0%. The principal and interest were payable in cash or in
    stock (shares to be determined based on the VWAP 20 days
    prior to settlement) at the Company’s discretion. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company included $50.9 million
    as a current liability on the balance sheet.

In January 2007, KCS advised TMM that KCS intended to assert
    claims totaling an amount greater than $47.0 million for
    indemnification under the Acquisition Agreement related to
    representations and warranties made by TMM. In February 2007,
    KCS received notice from TMM indicating that TMM would seek
    damages from KCS under the Acquisition Agreement. On
    September 24, 2007, KCS entered into a Settlement Agreement
    (“Agreement”) with Grupo TMM, S.A.B. (“TMM”,
    formerly Grupo TMM, S.A.), TMM Logistics, S.A. de C.V., a
    subsidiary of TMM, and VEX Asesores Corporativos, S.A. de C.V.
    (formerly José F. Serrano International Business, S.A. de
    C.V.) (the “Consulting Firm”), resolving certain
    claims and disputes over liabilities established as part of
    KCS’ acquisition of KCSM. Pursuant to the terms of the
    Agreement, KCS paid TMM $54.1 million in cash to retire the
    two notes discussed above, totaling $86.6 million. This
    Agreement was primarily accounted for as a change to the final
    purchase price of KCS’ investment in KCSM. KCSM adjusted
    its purchase accounting assets and will reduce prospectively the
    amortization of these assets over approximately the next twenty
    four years.

KCSR
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    April 28, 2006, KCS, KCSR and the other subsidiary
    guarantors named therein entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement (the “2006 Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of $371.1 million with The Bank of Nova
    Scotia and other lenders named in the 2006 Credit Agreement.
    Proceeds from the 2006 Credit Agreement were used to refinance
    all amounts outstanding under KCSR’s previous credit
    agreement. The 2006 Credit Agreement initially consisted of a
    $125.0 million revolving credit facility with a letter of
    credit sublimit of $25.0 million and swing line advances of
    up to $15.0 million, and a $246.1 million term loan
    facility (or “Term Loan B Facility”). On May 31,
    2007, KCSR entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 Credit
    Agreement which provided for a new $75.0 million term loan
    facility (the “Term Loan C Facility”) under the 2006
    Credit Agreement. Proceeds from advances under the Term Loan C
    Facility were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the
    revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears
    interest at either LIBOR, or an alternate base rate, plus a
    spread based on the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in
    the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Term Loan B Facility bears
    interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points or the alternative
    base rate plus 75 basis points. The Term Loan C Facility
    bears interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the
    alternative base rate plus 50 basis points. The 2006 Credit
    Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit certain
    actions, including, but not limited to, KCS’ ability to
    incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make prepayment of
    particular debt, pay dividends, make investments, engage in
    transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital
    stock, sell certain assets, and engage in mergers and
    consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions. In addition,



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

KCS must meet certain consolidated interest coverage and
    leverage ratios. Failure to maintain compliance with the
    covenants could constitute a default which could accelerate the
    payment of any outstanding amounts under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. Borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement are
    secured by substantially all of the Company’s domestic
    assets and are guaranteed by the majority of its domestic
    subsidiaries.

The final maturity date for the revolving credit facility is
    April 28, 2011 and the final maturity date for the Term
    Loan B Facility and the Term Loan C Facility is April 28,
    2013. The 2006 Credit Agreement, however, provides for an
    earlier termination date which is 90 days prior to the
    earliest final maturity date of any outstanding KCSR

    and

    unless the 2006 Credit Agreement facilities are rated at least

    Company intends to refinance the


/


%
    Notes prior to such date. During the third quarter, the Company
    reclassified the obligations outstanding under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement from long term debt to current debt. As of
    December 31, 2007, advances under the revolving credit
    facility totaled $120.0 million and the Term Loan B and
    Term Loan C facility balances were $242.5 million and
    $74.6 million, respectively. Each of these obligations has
    been reclassified from long term debt to current debt. Revolver
    availability as of December 31, 2007 was $5.0 million.

On January 31, 2007, KCS provided written notice to the
    lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement of certain
    representation and other defaults under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement arising from the potential defaults which existed
    under the KCSR indentures governing the


/


% Notes
    and


/

    as described in the second paragraph under Senior Notes below.
    These defaults limited KCSR’s access to the revolving
    credit facility. In its notice of default, the Company also
    requested that the lenders waive these defaults. On
    February 5, 2007, the Company received a waiver of such
    defaults from all of the lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement.

On January 29, 2007, the Company commenced a consent
    solicitation to amend the indentures under which the

    Notes were issued. The Company identified certain

    (i) resolve an inconsistency in the inclusion of certain
    expenses, but not the income, of restricted subsidiaries in the
    calculation of the consolidated coverage ratio under the
    indentures, (ii) amend the definition of refinancing
    indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain related premiums,
    interest, fees and expenses in permitted refinancing
    indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any defaults
    arising from certain actions taken in the absence of such
    proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    obtained the requisite consents from the holders of the

Tex-Mex
    Debt.

RRIF Loan Agreement.

On June 28, 2005,
    Tex-Mex entered into an agreement with the Federal Railroad
    Administration (“FRA”) to borrow $50.0 million to
    be used for infrastructure improvements which are

    City Southern

    Statements — (Continued)

expected to increase efficiency and capacity in order to
    accommodate growing freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA
    corridor. At December 31, 2005, Tex-Mex had borrowed a net
    amount of $21.7 million under the loan agreement. Tex-Mex
    drew down the remaining $28.2 million during 2006. The note
    bears interest at 4.29% annually and the principal balance
    amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of July 13, 2030.
    The loan was made under the Railroad Rehabilitation and
    Improvement Financing (“RRIF”) Program administered by
    the FRA. The loan is guaranteed by Mexrail, which has issued a
    Pledge Agreement in favor of the lender equal to the gross
    revenues earned by Mexrail on per-car fees on traffic crossing
    the International Rail Bridge in Laredo, Texas.

On February 16, 2007, Tex-Mex and the FRA entered into
    Amendment No. 1 and Waiver No. 1 to the loan
    agreement, the purpose of which was to eliminate the obligation
    of Tex-Mex to provide audited annual financial statements to the
    FRA and to waive Tex-Mex’s failure to do so since entering
    into the loan agreement. To induce the FRA to agree to such
    amendment and waiver, the Company has agreed to provide the FRA
    with its audited annual financial statements and unaudited
    quarterly statements and has also agreed to guaranty the
    scheduled principal payment installments due to the FRA from
    Tex-Mex under the loan agreement on a rolling five-year basis.

KCSM
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    October 24, 2005, KCSM entered into a credit agreement (the
    “2005 KCSM Credit Agreement”) in an aggregate amount
    of $106.0 million, with a maturity date of October 28,
    2008. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement consisted of a
    $30.0 million revolving credit facility and a
    $76.0 million term loan facility secured by the locomotives
    and rail cars owned by KCSM’s subsidiary, Arrendadora. For
    loans denominated in U.S. dollars, the facilities bore
    interest at LIBOR plus a spread based on KCSM’s leverage
    ratio as defined under the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement. For loans
    denominated in Mexican pesos, the facilities bore interest at
    the Tasa de Interes Interbancario de Equilibrio
    (“TIIE”), the

28-day

Mexican inter-bank rate, plus a spread based on KCSM’s
    leverage ratio. Proceeds from the facilities were used primarily
    to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes. At
    December 31, 2006 there were no advances outstanding under
    the $30.0 million revolving credit facility. On
    November 21, 2006, KCSM paid down $29.0 million of the
    term loan facility from the proceeds of its


/


% senior
    notes offering. At December 31, 2006, the term loan’s
    balance was $46.7 million. The proceeds from the new credit
    agreement (the “2007 KCSM Credit Agreement”) were used
    to pay down all amounts outstanding under the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement contained covenants
    and restrictions similar to those in KCSR’s Credit
    Agreement.

On April 7, 2006, KCSM entered into an amendment and waiver
    (“KCSM Amendment and Waiver”) related to the 2005 KCSM
    Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement was amended to
    (i) exclude certain payment obligations accrued under two
    locomotive maintenance agreements and under a track maintenance
    rehabilitation agreement from the definition of Indebtedness,
    (ii) eliminate certain minimum and multiple borrowing
    thresholds for peso borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting requirement to
    provide unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
    fourth fiscal quarter. The KCSM Amendment and Waiver also waived
    certain reporting requirements, including the requirement of
    KCSM to provide audited consolidated financial statements
    90 days after the end of the 2005 fiscal year, provided
    such reports were delivered by April 30, 2006, and
    compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio obligations of
    Section 7.1(c) of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement for the
    four quarters ended December 31, 2005, if compliance
    therewith was calculated without giving effect to the amendment
    to the definition of “Indebtedness” in the KCSM
    Amendment and Waiver, provided that KCSM was in compliance
    therewith after giving effect to the KCSM Amendment and Waiver.

On June 14, 2007, KCSM entered into a new unsecured credit
    agreement (the “2007 KCSM Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of up to $111.0 million, consisting of a
    revolving credit facility of up to



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$81.0 million, and a term loan facility of up to
    $30.0 million with Bank of America, N.A., BBVA Bancomer,
    S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, and the other
    lenders named in the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement. KCSM used the
    proceeds from the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement to pay (a) all
    amounts outstanding under the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement, and to
    pay all fees and expenses related to the refinancing of the 2005
    KCSM Credit Agreement, (b) to pay all amounts outstanding
    in respect of KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2007, (c) to refinance a portion of KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012, (d) to pay all amounts outstanding under
    KCSM’s Bridge Loan Agreement dated April 30, 2007, and
    (e) for general corporate purposes. The maturity date for
    the revolving credit facility is December 30, 2011, and the
    maturity date for the term loan facility is June 29, 2012.
    Loans under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement bear interest at
    LIBOR plus a spread based on KCSM’s leverage ratio as
    defined under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement. The 2007 KCSM
    Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit
    certain actions that are customary for these types of
    agreements. In addition, KCSM must meet certain consolidated
    interest coverage ratios, consolidated leverage ratios, and
    fixed charge coverage ratios. KCSM is not currently in default
    of the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement and has access to the
    revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2007, advances
    under the revolving credit facility were $20.0 million,
    with $61.0 million remaining available under the facility.

On December 19, 2007, KCSM entered into Amendment and
    Waiver No. 1 to the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement (“KCSM
    Amendment and Waiver No. 1”) to modify certain terms
    to permit the KCSM to finance the acquisition of new locomotives
    by incurring indebtedness on an accelerated basis as compared to
    the original terms contained in the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement.
    The KCSM Amendment and Waiver No. 1 also waives certain
    prospective defaults under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement as of
    the quarter ended December 31, 2007, as a result of the
    acquisition of the new locomotives in the fourth quarter of
    2007, in order to permit the Company sufficient time to complete
    its financing of the new locomotives.

    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

Income
    Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
    reported on the Company’s income tax return, and deferred
    tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by
    the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
    differences reverse. Valuation allowances are used to reduce
    deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be
    realized.

Difference Attributable to KCSM Investment.

At
    December 31, 2007, the Company’s book basis exceeded
    the tax basis of its investment in KCSM by $660.8 million.
    The Company has not provided a deferred income tax liability for
    the income taxes, if any, which might become payable on the
    realization of



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

this basis difference because the Company intends to
    indefinitely reinvest in KCSM the financial accounting earnings
    which gave rise to the basis differential. Moreover, the Company
    has no other plans to realize this basis differential by a sale
    of its investment in KCSM. If the Company were to realize this
    basis difference in the future by a receipt of dividends or the
    sale of its interest in KCSM, as of December 31, 2007, the
    Company would incur gross federal income taxes of
    $231.3 million, which might be partially offset by foreign
    tax credits related to Mexican income taxes.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in KCSM on
    April 1, 2005, KCSM provided deferred income taxes for the
    difference between the financial reporting and income tax bases
    of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its proportionate
    share of these income taxes through its equity in KCSM’s
    earnings. Since April 1, 2005, KCSM income taxes are
    reflected in the consolidated results. Although KCSM has
    generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due primarily
    to the accelerated tax amortization of the Concession rights.
    The Company has recognized a deferred income tax asset for the
    resulting net operating loss carryforwards. Management
    anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
    realized given the expiration dates (through the year
    2046) of the loss carryforwards, as well as the fact that
    KCSM is expected to generate taxable income in the future.
    Management’s tax projections take into consideration
    certain assumptions, some of which are under their control and
    others which are not. Key assumptions include inflation rates,
    currency fluctuations, future income and future capital
    expenditures. If management’s assumptions are not correct,
    a valuation allowance may have to be recognized on the deferred
    tax asset.

As described in Note 4, on September 12, 2005, the
    Company and its subsidiaries, KCSM, along with TMM, entered into
    a settlement agreement with the Mexican government, resolving
    the controversies and disputes between the companies and the
    Mexican government concerning the payment of a value added tax
    (“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the obligation
    (“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of KCSM owned
    by the Mexican government (the “VAT/Put Settlement”).
    All Mexican income taxes on the VAT were paid as part of the
    VAT/Put Settlement. The Company believes, based upon opinions of
    outside legal counsel and other factors, that the VAT/Put
    Settlement is not taxable to KCS for U.S. income tax
    purposes.

Tax Carryovers.

In prior years, the Company
    has generated both U.S. federal and state net operating
    losses. The losses are carried forward 20 years for federal
    and from 5 to 20 years for state. Both the federal and
    state loss carryovers are analyzed each year to determine the
    likelihood of realization. The U.S. federal loss carryover
    at December 31, 2007, is $84.4 million and if not
    used, would begin to expire in 2021. The Company believes the
    federal loss carryover will be realized. In addition, the
    Company has $11.4 million of tax credits consisting
    primarily of $9.6 million of track maintenance credits
    which, if not used, will begin to expire in 2025, and
    $1 million of alternative minimum tax credits which do not
    have an expiration period.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and
    separately filed tax filings from as early as 1991. The loss
    carryovers may expire as early as December 31, 2008, and as
    late as December 31, 2027. The state loss carryover at
    December 31, 2007, is $489.2 million
    ($14.9 million of tax), of which it is expected that
    $198.4 million ($6.0 million of tax) will be realized.
    Management believes that state loss carryovers, net of the
    valuation allowance, will be ultimately realized.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at December 31, 2007,
    are $1,066 million and will expire as early as 2016 and as
    late as 2046. The Company believes the Mexican loss carryovers
    will be realized.

Internal Revenue Service Reviews.

The IRS is
    currently reviewing the consolidated federal income tax returns
    for the years 1997 through 2002. A current income tax liability
    has been accrued for the anticipated outcome. The Company
    believes that adequate provision has been made for any
    adjustment (taxes and interest) that may be assessed for all
    open years. The federal statute of limitations has closed for
    years prior to 1997.

Uncertain Tax Positions.

In June 2006, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
    Number 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

attribute for the financial statement recognition and
    measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
    tax return. FIN 48 requires the Company to recognize in the
    financial statements the benefit of a tax position only if the
    impact is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based
    on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.

The provisions of FIN 48 were effective for KCS beginning
    January 1, 2007. The Company recognized a cumulative effect
    of the change in accounting principle of $1.3 million
    recorded as a decrease to opening retained earnings. The total
    unrecognized tax benefit as of January 1, 2007 was
    $26.3 million of which $5.1 million would impact the
    effective tax rate if recognized.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

    uncertain positions which could change upon settlement include

    Service. Tax returns filed in Mexico from 2002 through the
    current year remain open to examination by the taxing
    authorities in Mexico.

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are
    included in income before taxes on the income statement. Accrued
    interest and penalties as of the date of adoption was
    $13.5 million with an increase of $2.3 million in 2007
    for a total of $15.8 million.

On October 1, 2007 the Entrepreneurial Tax of Unique Rate
    (referred to by its Spanish acronym, IETU or “Flat
    Tax”) in Mexico was enacted. The Flat Tax law will be
    effective on January 1, 2008 and replaces the Asset Tax
    law. The Flat Tax applies to a different tax base than the
    income tax and will be paid if the Flat Tax exceeds the income
    tax computed under existing law. The Company anticipates income
    taxes will equal or exceed the Flat Tax in future years;
    therefore deferred taxes have been provided at the historic
    income tax rates. The Company does not anticipate that the Flat
    Tax will have a material impact on its results of operations and
    financial condition.

Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
    Preferred Stock.

On May 5, 2003, the Company
    completed the sale of $200 million of Redeemable Cumulative
    Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series C
    Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $500 per
    share in a private offering. Dividends on the Series C
    Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly at an
    annual rate of 4.25% of the liquidation preference, as declared
    by the Company’s Board of Directors. Each share of
    Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into
    33.4728 shares of the Company’s common stock. After
    May 19, 2008, the Company may redeem any or all of the
    Series C Preferred Stock, subject to certain conditions.
    The Company may be required to redeem the Series C
    Preferred Stock from the holders at their option only if
    substantially all of the Company’s common stock is
    exchanged for or converted into common stock that is not listed
    on a U.S. national securities exchange or the NASDAQ
    National Market (a “fundamental change”). The
    practical effect of this provision is to limit the
    Company’s ability to eliminate a holder’s ability to
    convert the Series C Preferred Stock into common shares of
    a publicly traded company through a merger or consolidation
    transaction.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Accordingly, since the Company is in a position to control
    whether the Company experiences a fundamental change, the
    Series C Preferred Stock is classified as permanent equity
    capital.

Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock.

On December 9, 2005, KCS completed
    the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its 5.125%
    Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per
    share (“Series D Preferred Stock”). Each share of
    Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into
    33.3333 shares of KCS common stock, subject to certain
    adjustments. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are
    cumulative and payable quarterly in any combination of cash and
    KCS common stock, as declared by the KCS Board of Directors, at
    the rate of 5.125% per annum of the liquidation preference of
    $1,000. The Series D Preferred Stock ranks senior to the
    common stock and to each class or series of KCS capital stock
    that has terms that provide that such class or series will rank
    junior to the Series D Preferred Stock. After
    February 19, 2011, KCS may convert all of the Series D
    Preferred Stock into common stock at the then prevailing
    conversion rate, but only if the closing sale price of the
    common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect
    equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference for 20
    trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, and
    if KCS has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the
    dividend payment date immediately preceding the forced
    conversion date.

Upon certain designated events (a “fundamental
    change”), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may,
    subject to legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or
    all of the shares, which KCS may pay in either cash, in shares
    of KCS stock or any combination thereof, at KCS’ option.
    Since KCS has the ability in this event to pay the redemption
    price in KCS common stock (which is not required to be
    registered), the Series D Preferred Stock is classified as
    permanent equity capital. The number of shares to be issued
    would be based upon the value of KCS common stock at that time
    but in no event will the number of shares issued on the
    occurrence of a fundamental change exceed 52.5 million
    shares.

On December 12, 2005, the Company used substantially all of
    the proceeds from the Series D Preferred Stock offering to
    repurchase 9,000,000 shares of KCS common stock issued to
    TMM in April 2005 in connection with the acquisition of KCSM.
    All of the 9,000,000 shares were purchased at a price of
    $22.25 per share or $200.3 million. The Company does not
    have a formal program for the repurchase of any additional
    shares of its equity securities.

    the preparation of the 2005 financial statements of KCS, the
    Company determined that its Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as
    defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% Notes
    and


/


% Notes)
    was less than 2.0:1. As a result, pursuant to the terms of each
    KCSR indenture, the Company was unable to pay cash dividends on
    its Series C Preferred Stock and dividends in cash or
    shares of KCS common stock on its Series D Preferred Stock.
    The dividends accumulate until such ratio increases to at least
    2.0:1. On January 12, 2007, KCS declared a dividend on the
    Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock
    for all outstanding arrear dividends. As of December 31,
    2007, KCS is current with respect to its Preferred Stock
    dividend payments.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

On September 27,
    2005, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the
    Company’s common stock to stockholders of record as of the
    close of business on October 12, 2005, replacing a previous
    Rights Agreement that expired on October 12, 2005. Each
    right entitles the stockholder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or
    in certain circumstances, common stock, other securities, cash
    or other assets), at a price of $100 per share (both shares and
    price are subject to adjustment periodically to prevent
    dilution). The rights are traded with the Company’s common
    stock.

The Rights Plan has certain anti-takeover provisions that may
    cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire the Company without the approval of the Board of
    Directors. The Rights Plan will not interfere with any offer for
    all of the outstanding common stock that has the approval of the
    Independent Directors. The rights will become exercisable after
    a non-approved person or group has acquired,

or a tender offer is made for, 15% or more of the common stock
    of the Company (13% or more in the case of certain acquisitions
    by “Adverse Persons”). Right holders (other than the
    acquiring person or group) may then exercise their rights at the
    then current purchase price, and receive the number of shares of
    Preferred Stock (or in certain circumstances, common stock)
    having a market value of two times the purchase price of the
    rights. Additionally, if the Company is thereafter merged into
    another entity, or if more than 50% of the Company’s
    consolidated assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
    holders of the rights may exercise their rights at the then
    current purchase price and receive common stock of the acquirer
    equal to two times the purchase price of the rights. KCS may
    redeem the rights for $0.0025 per right until a triggering
    acquisition. The rights expire October 11, 2010.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and
    certain of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with
    employees whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a
    change in control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock
    options become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
    automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
    specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
    trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
    entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts on December 31,
    2007, were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at the
    time of any such change in control, the most significant factor
    of which would be the highest price paid for KCS common stock by
    a party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
    Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Stock Option Plan.

The Kansas City Southern
    1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award
    Plan (as amended and restated effective May 5, 2004) (the
    “Plan”) provides for the granting of options to
    purchase up to 16.0 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock by officers and other designated employees. Options
    have been granted under the Plan at 100% of the average market
    price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant and
    generally have a 5 year cliff vesting period and are
    exercisable over the 10 year contractual term, except that
    options outstanding with limited rights (“LRs”) or
    limited stock appreciation rights (“LSARs”), become
    immediately exercisable upon certain defined circumstances
    constituting a change in control of the Company. The Plan
    includes provisions for stock appreciation rights, LRs and
    LSARs. All outstanding options include LSARs, except for options
    granted to non-employee Directors prior to 1999. The grant date
    fair value, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to expense
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:

The Company has not paid dividends to common shareholders since
    January of 2000 and currently does not expect to pay dividends
    to common stockholders in the future. The expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock
    price over a term equal to the estimated life of the options.
    The risk-free interest rate is determined based on the
    U.S. Treasury rates approximating the expected life of the
    options granted, which represents the period of time the awards
    are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical
    experience of similar awards.

Nonvested Stock.

The Kansas City Southern 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan
    provides for the granting of nonvested stock awards to officers
    and other designated employees. The grant date fair value is
    based on the average market price of the stock on the date of
    the grant. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment
    terminates during the vesting period, which is generally five
    year cliff vesting for employees and one year for directors. The
    grant date fair value of nonvested shares, less estimated
    forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period.

    December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, $19.7 million of unrecognized

    1.64 years. The fair value (at vest date) of shares vested
    during the year ended December 31, 2007, was
    $2.0 million.

Performance Based Awards.

During 2007, the
    Company granted performance based nonvested stock awards. The
    awards granted establish an annual target number of shares that
    generally vest at the end of a three year requisite service
    period following the grant date. In addition to the three year
    service condition, the number of nonvested shares to be received
    depends on the attainment of performance goals based on the
    following annual measures: operating ratio, earnings before
    interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and return
    on capital employed. The number of nonvested shares ultimately
    earned will range from zero to 200% of the annual target award.

The performance shares earned in 2007 were 192,065, which was
    approximately 134% of the annual target award granted for the
    2007 performance period. Over the remaining two year performance
    period, participants in the aggregate can earn up to a maximum
    of 668,630 shares.

The Company expenses the grant date fair value of the awards
    which are probable of being earned based on forecasted annual
    performance goals over the three year performance period.
    Compensation expense on performance based awards was
    $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for
    performance based awards was $1.1 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2007, $2.4 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost related to performance based awards is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.13 years. The unrecognized compensation cost includes
    only the amount determined to be probable of being earned based
    upon the attainment of the annual performance goals.

SFAS 123R requires that the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
    required under prior guidance. Excess tax benefits from
    share-based compensation of $2.4 million and
    $0.2 million were included in cash used for financing
    activities for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), established in 1977,
    provides substantially all full-time employees of the Company,
    certain subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities, with
    the right to subscribe to an aggregate of 11.4 million
    shares of common stock. The ESPP is subject to annual approval
    by the Company’s Board of Directors. Employees may elect to
    withhold an amount from payroll on the offering date in exchange
    for rights to purchase a fixed number of designated shares of
    the Company’s common stock. For offerings under the
    Nineteenth, Eighteenth, and Seventeenth Offerings, the purchase
    prices for shares was equal to 90% of the average market price
    on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever is
    lower. Under SFAS 123R, both the 10% discount in grant
    price and the 90% share option are valued to derive the
    award’s fair value. The awards vest and the expense is
    recognized ratably over one year. The following table summarizes

Profit
    Sharing and Other Postretirement Benefits

Health and Welfare.

Certain
    U.S. employees that have met age and service requirements
    are eligible for life insurance coverage and medical benefits
    during retirement. The retiree medical plan is contributory and
    provides benefits to retirees, their covered dependents and
    beneficiaries. The plan provides for annual adjustments to
    retiree contributions, and also contains, depending on the
    coverage selected, certain deductibles, co-payments,
    co-insurance, and coordination with Medicare. Certain management
    employees also maintain their status under a collective
    bargaining agreement, which permits them access to
    post-retirement medical under the multiemployer plan described
    below. The life insurance plan is non-contributory and covers
    retirees only. The Company’s policy, in most cases, is to
    fund benefits payable under these plans as the obligations
    become due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds
    held in a life insurance company) exist with respect to life
    insurance benefits.

KCSM Union Pension.

During 2007, the Company
    formalized the substantive pension benefit settled in the form
    of a lump-sum post-retirement payment to retiring union
    employees in Mexico who leave the Company after age 60. The
    benefit to retirees is based on a statutory termination
    indemnity calculation under Mexican law which considers the
    retiree’s salary at the time of retirement and the number
    of years of credited service. Beginning in 2008, the plan will
    also include a social security bridge benefit for employees
    retiring between ages 55 and 60 and a disability benefit.
    In addition, the Company will fund individual accounts for
    employees by contributing a fixed percentage of their pay, as
    well as matching 50% of the amount voluntarily contributed by
    the employee. The benefit paid upon retirement will be the
    greater of the statutorily based benefit and the accumulated
    company contributions in the participant’s account.

The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its
    pension and post-retirement benefit obligations.

The obligation related to the KCSM pension was acquired with the

    April 1, 2005. The pension cost presented for 2005
    represents an estimated cost for the nine month period from
    April 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005. Prior to
    April 1, 2005, KCSM was accounted for as an equity method
    investee. The pension obligation was established during the
    finalization of purchase accounting (see Note 4). The
    pension costs since the date of acquisition have been included

Benefits paid for the reconciliation of the benefit obligation

    life insurance benefits. Medical benefits are funded as
    obligations become due.

(ii)

During 2007, the Company formalized its substantive pension
    benefit which resulted in a plan amendment. The prior service
    cost related to the plan amendment was included as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized
    over the estimated remaining life of the participants of
    17 years.

Assumptions

The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs
    are selected based on current and expected market conditions.
    Discount rates are selected based on low risk government bonds
    with cash flows approximating the timing of expected benefit
    payments. The Mexico bond market is utilized for the KCSM
    pension obligation and the U.S. bond market is utilized for
    the U.S. health and welfare obligation. The expected rate
    of return on life insurance plan assets is determined using
    historical and forward looking returns for similar investments
    over the period that the benefits are expected to be paid.

Multi-Employer Plan.

Under collective
    bargaining agreements, KCSR participates in a multi-employer
    benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care
    and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees and
    certain retirees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as
    incurred and were $2.8 million, $2.6 million, and
    $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The Company
    sponsors the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the
    “401(k) plan”), whereby participants can choose to
    make contributions in the form of salary deductions pursuant to
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
    matches 401(k) contributions up to a maximum of 5% of
    compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, the Company

    Profit Sharing Plan.

Note 11.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which,
    except as set forth below, are of an ordinary, routine nature
    and incidental to its operations. Included in these proceedings
    are various tort claims brought by current and former employees
    for job related injuries and by third parties for injuries
    related to railroad operations. KCS aggressively defends these
    matters and has established liability reserves which management
    believes are adequate to cover expected costs. Although it is
    not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding, in
    the opinion of management, other than those proceedings
    described in detail below, such proceedings and actions should
    not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition and liquidity.
    However, a material adverse outcome in one or more of these
    proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the
    operating results of a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Reinsurance Litigation.

As previously
    disclosed in the Company’s quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

insurance companies who provided insurance to the Company filed
    an action in federal court in Vermont (“Reinsurance
    Litigation”) seeking a declaration that they have no
    obligation to indemnify the Company concerning a particular
    casualty claim. That claim,

Kemp, et al. v. The Kansas
    City Southern Railway Company, et al.

, was filed in the
    Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri
    (“Litigation”) and went to trial in September 2006.
    The Company reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the
    Litigation, which was paid out in the first quarter of 2007. The
    Company also reached settlements with various parties, including
    the insurance companies involved in the Reinsurance Litigation,
    to indemnify the Company for a significant portion of the
    litigation settlement. The litigation settlement was fully
    reflected in the Company’s financial statements and the
    Company does not have any further risk associated with this
    litigation or the Reinsurance Litigation.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s
    U.S. operations are subject to extensive federal, state and
    local environmental laws and regulations. The major
    U.S. environmental laws to which the Company is subject
    include, among others, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA,”
    also known as the Superfund law), the Toxic Substances Control
    Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Hazardous
    Materials Transportation Act. CERCLA can impose joint and
    several liabilities for cleanup and investigation costs, without
    regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on current
    and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well as those
    who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous
    substances. The Company does not believe that compliance with
    the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will
    impair its competitive capability or result in any material
    additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs.
    The Company is, however, subject to environmental remediation
    costs as described below.

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
    railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
    chemicals industry, the Company transports hazardous materials
    and has a professional team available to respond to and handle
    environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
    materials. Additionally, the Company is a partner in the
    Responsible
    Care

®

program and, as a result, has initiated additional
    environmental, health and safety programs. The Company performs
    ongoing reviews and evaluations



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

of the various environmental programs and issues within the
    Company’s operations, and, as necessary, takes actions
    intended to limit the Company’s exposure to potential
    liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
    industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
    Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
    investigation and cleanup of contaminants, claims alleging
    personal injury, or property damage as the result of exposures
    to, or release of, hazardous substances. Although the Company is
    responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at
    several locations, based on currently available information, the
    Company does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
    collectively, to have a material impact on its financial
    position or cash flows. Should the Company become subject to
    more stringent cleanup requirements at these sites, discover
    additional contamination, or become subject to related personal
    or property damage claims, the Company could incur material
    costs in connection with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
    costs related to past activities when the Company’s
    obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
    operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
    liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
    undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
    may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
    Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
    management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or cash flows.

Environmental remediation expense was $7.4 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, and was included in
    casualties and insurance expense on the consolidated statements
    of income. Additionally, as of December 31, 2007, KCS had a
    liability for environmental remediation of $9.9 million.
    This amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates
    based upon the studies and site surveys described above and in
    accordance with SFAS 5.

Casualty Claim Reserves.

The Company’s
    casualty and liability reserve for its U.S. business
    segment is based on actuarial studies performed on an
    undiscounted basis. This reserve is based on personal injury
    claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet
    reported. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is
    dependent on various factors, it is management’s opinion
    that the recorded liability is a reasonable estimate of
    aggregate future payments. Adjustments to the liability are
    reflected as operating expenses in the period in which changes
    to estimates are known. Casualty claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
    amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
    The activity in the reserve follows

(in millions):

(21.5

)

Balance at end of year

$

$

117.4

The casualty claim reserve balance as of December 31, 2007,
    is based on an updated study of casualty reserves for data
    through November 30, 2007 and a roll-forward and review of
    December’s experience. The activity for the twelve months
    ended December 31, 2007 primarily relates to net
    settlements. The increase in payments from prior year reflects
    one large casualty claim paid in the first quarter of 2007, the
    reserves for FELA, third party, and occupational illness claims.

Reflecting potential uncertainty surrounding the outcome of
    casualty claims, it is reasonably possible based on assessments
    that future costs to settle casualty claims may range from
    approximately $84 million to $99 million. While the
    final outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
    certainty, management believes that the $90.0 million
    recorded is the best estimate of the Company’s future
    obligations for the settlement of casualty claims at
    December 31, 2007. The most sensitive assumptions for
    personal injury accruals are the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

expected average cost per claim and the projected frequency
    rates for the number of claims that will ultimately result in
    payment. A 5% increase or decrease in either the expected
    average cost per claim or the frequency rate for claims with
    payments would result in an approximate $4.5 million
    increase or decrease in the Company’s recorded personal
    injury reserves.

Management believes that previous reserve estimates for prior
    claims were reasonable based on current information available.
    The Company is continuing its practice of accruing monthly for
    estimated claim costs, including any changes, recommended by
    studies performed and evaluation of recent known trends; based
    on this practice, management believes all accruals are
    appropriately reflected.

Antitrust Lawsuit.

As of December 31,
    2007, 28 putative class actions have been filed against The
    Kansas City Southern Railway Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the Company (“KCSR”), along with the other
    Class I U.S. railroads (and, in some cases, the
    Association of American Railroads), in various Federal district
    courts alleging that the railroads conspired to fix fuel
    surcharges in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. On
    November 6, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
    Litigation (“JPML”) ordered that these putative class
    action cases be consolidated for pretrial handling before the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where
    the matters remain pending. In addition, the New Jersey Attorney
    General has initiated an investigation of rail fuel surcharges
    and has sought information regarding those surcharges from KCSR
    and other railroads. KCSR is cooperating with the New Jersey
    Attorney General’s request for information while preserving
    all of its legal defenses. KCSR believes that the price fixing
    allegations against it have no merit, believes it has strong
    defenses and intends to vigorously contest these lawsuits
    through trial and appeal if necessary. While the final outcome
    of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company
    believes that these matters will not have a material adverse
    effect on any of its consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or business.

Disputes Relating to Payments for the Use of Trackage and
    Haulage Rights and Interline Services.

KCSM and
    Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”) both
    initiated administrative proceedings seeking a determination by
    the Mexican

Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes

(“Ministry of Communications and Transportation”
    or “SCT”) of the rates that the companies should pay
    each other in connection with the use of trackage and haulage
    rights and interline and terminal services. The SCT, in March of
    2002, issued rulings setting the rates for trackage and haulage
    rights. In August of 2002, the SCT issued a ruling setting the
    rates for interline and terminal services. KCSM and Ferromex
    appealed both rulings. Following the trial and appellate court
    decisions, the Mexican Supreme Court in February of 2006, in a
    ruling from the bench, sustained KCSM’s appeal of the
    SCT’s trackage and haulage rights ruling, vacating the
    ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent
    with the Court’s opinion. KCSM has not yet received the
    written opinion of the Mexican Supreme Court relating to the
    interline and terminal services appeal. In October 2006, KCSM
    was served with a claim raised by Ferromex in which Ferromex
    asked for information concerning the interline traffic between
    KCSM and Ferromex from January 2002 through December 2004. The

th

Civil
    Court issued an order directing KCSM to allow Ferromex to review
    certain account logs. KCSM appealed such order to the

st

Civil
    District Court and is awaiting a decision. KCSM expects this
    litigation to continue over the next few years. KCSM believes
    that, based on its assessment of the facts in this case, there
    will be no material impact to its financial statements.

Disputes Relating to the Scope of the Mandatory Trackage
    Rights.

KCSM and Ferromex are parties to various
    civil cases involving disputes over the application and proper
    interpretation of the mandatory trackage rights. In August 2002,
    the SCT issued rulings determining Ferromex’s trackage
    rights in Monterrey, Nuevo León. KCSM and Ferromex both
    appealed the SCT’s rulings. At the Mexican Administrate
    Federal Court level, KCSM obtained what it believed were
    favorable rulings in April 2005. Ferromex appealed these rulings
    and the case was returned to the Mexican Administrative Federal
    Court. The Administrative Federal Court issued a ruling on
    June 11, 2007, which was served on KCSM on August 8,
    2007. In the ruling, the Mexican Administrative Federal Court
    reversed the earlier favorable ruling and decided that Ferromex
    could use certain



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

auxiliary tracks awarded to KCSM in its concession. KCSM
    appealed this ruling at the beginning of September 2007, arguing
    that the Mexican Administrative Federal Court wrongly failed to
    consider the earlier favorable decision in making its revised
    ruling and also failed to consider the length and limits of the
    trackage rights included in KCSM’s Concession Title. The
    Company believes that based on its assessment of the facts in
    this case, there will be no material effect on KCS’ results
    of operations.

Acquisition of Locomotives.

In April 2007,
    KCSR and KCSM entered into definitive purchase agreements with
    EMD to acquire an aggregate of 70 locomotives for delivery in
    October 2007 through April 2008 at an aggregate cost of
    approximately $150 million. KCSR will acquire 30 of these
    locomotives and intends to finance the acquisitions through
    operating leases. None of the 30 locomotives have been received
    as of December 31, 2007. KCSM has acquired and purchased 35
    of the remaining 40 locomotives as of December 31, 2007.

In August 2007, KCSR and KCSM entered into definitive purchase
    agreements with General Electric Company (“GE”) to
    acquire an aggregate of 80 locomotives with delivery beginning
    in September of 2007 continuing through August 2008 at an
    aggregate cost of approximately $175 million, with 30
    delivered to KCSR and the remaining 50 delivered to KCSM. In
    September 2007, KCSR received all 30 locomotives and has
    financed the locomotives through an operating lease. KCSM has
    received and purchased 20 of the 50 locomotives as of
    December 31, 2007.

PCRC Guarantees and Indemnities.

The Company
    is a guarantor for an equipment loan to PCRC of approximately
    $0.3 million and has issued four irrevocable standby
    letters of credit totaling approximately $3.0 million to
    fulfill the Company’s fifty percent guarantee of additional
    equipment loans. As discussed in Note 3, the Company agreed
    to indemnify Mi-Jack for 50% of any claims made on a
    $9.6 million letter of credit obtained by Mi-Jack to
    partially fund a debt service reserve account and to fund a
    liquidity account, each of which was established by PCRC in
    connection with the issuance of the Notes. Additionally, KCS has
    pledged its shares of PCRC as security for PCRC’s
    7.0% Senior Secured Notes due November 2026.

Note 12.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company does not engage in the trading of derivative
    financial instruments except where the Company’s objective
    is to manage fuel price risk and foreign currency fluctuations.
    In general, the Company enters into derivative transactions in
    limited situations based on management’s assessment of
    current market conditions and perceived risks. However,
    management intends to respond to evolving business and market
    conditions and in doing so, may enter into such transactions
    more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company was not a party to any fuel
    swap agreements. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was a
    party to fuel swap agreements for 1.3 million gallons. Fuel
    hedging transactions consisting of fuel swaps as well as forward
    purchase commitments resulted in a decrease in fuel expense of
    $0.3 million, $0.7 million, and $2.4 million in
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The purpose of the
    foreign exchange contracts of KCSM is to limit exposure arising
    from exchange rate fluctuations in its Mexican peso-denominated
    financial assets and liabilities. Management determines the
    nature and quantity of any hedging transactions based upon net
    asset exposure and market conditions. As of December 31,
    2007, the Company did not have any outstanding call option
    contracts. As of December 31, 2006, KCSM had one peso call
    option outstanding in the notational amount of $1.7 million
    based on an exchange rate per dollar of 14.50 Mexican pesos. The
    option expired on May 30, 2007.

Foreign Currency Balances.

At
    December 31, 2007, KCSM had financial assets and
    liabilities denominated in Mexican pesos of Ps1,921 million
    and Ps595 million, respectively. At December 31, 2006,
    KCSM had financial assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican
    pesos of Ps2,304 million and Ps651 million,
    respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the exchange
    rate was 10.90 pesos per dollar and 10.82 pesos per dollar,
    respectively.

Segment
    Reporting

The accompanying segment reporting information

(in millions)

has been prepared and presented pursuant to Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures
    about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
    KCS operates under two reportable business segments, which are
    currently defined geographically as U.S. and Mexico. As the KCS
    rail network and other processes continue to coordinate as a
    network system, KCS will continue to evaluate its segment
    reporting. Appropriate eliminations of revenue and
    reclassifications of operating revenues and expenses have been
    recorded in deriving consolidated data. The U.S. segment
    consists primarily of KCSR and Tex-Mex. The Mexico segment
    consists of KCSM and Arrendadora.

The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the fiscal year for
    which this annual report on

Form 10-K

is filed. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the current
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in reports filed or
    submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and include
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is
    accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting that occurred during the last

    report) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

(c) Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The report of management on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) is included as “Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” in
    Item 8.

KPMG LLP, the independent public accounting firm that audited
    the Company’s financial statements contained herein, has
    issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.

The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
