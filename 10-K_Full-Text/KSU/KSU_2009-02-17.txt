Business

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding
    company with domestic and international rail operations in North
    America that are strategically focused on the growing
    north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and
    industrial markets in the central United States with major
    industrial cities in Mexico. As used herein, “KCS” or
    the “Company” may refer to Kansas City Southern or, as
    the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of Kansas City
    Southern. KCS and its subsidiaries had approximately
    6,400 employees on December 31, 2008. The Kansas City
    Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), which was founded
    in 1887, is a U.S. Class I railroad. KCSR serves a
    ten-state region in the midwest and southeast regions of the
    United States and has the shortest north/south rail route
    between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the
    Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern
    de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”). KCS previously
    owned this stock through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grupo
    KCSM, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as
    Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or
    Grupo TFM. Effective May 8, 2007, Grupo KCSM was merged
    into KCSM. Through its

50-year

Concession from the Mexican government (the
    “Concession”), which will expire in 2047 unless
    extended, KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican
    railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic
    portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway between
    Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s
    principal industrial cities and three of its major seaports.
    KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the
    United States and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo,
    Mexico, the largest rail freight interchange point between the
    United States and Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM has the
    right to control and operate the southern half of the rail
    bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River
    between the United States and Mexico.

The Company wholly owns, directly and indirectly through its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”)
    which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex owns a

157-mile

rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of
    Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR
    with KCSM. Tex-Mex connects with KCSM at the United
    States/Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and connects to KCSR
    through trackage rights at Beaumont, Texas. Through its
    ownership of Mexrail, the Company owns the northern half of the
    rail bridge at Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal
    international gateway through which more than half of all rail
    and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico crosses
    the border. The Company also controls the southern half of this
    bridge through its ownership of KCSM.

The KCS coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex)
    comprises approximately 6,000 miles of main and branch
    lines extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the
    United States south into Mexico and connects with other
    Class I railroads, providing shippers with an effective
    alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to
    Mexico and the southeast and southwest United States through
    less congested interchange hubs.

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), a joint venture
    company owned equally by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc.
    (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession from the
    Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal
    Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international container shipping companies with a railway
    transportation option in lieu of the Panama Canal. The
    concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of
    25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional
    25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south
    railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic
    and Pacific Oceans. PCRC’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Panarail Tourism Company (“Panarail”), operates and
    promotes commuter and tourist passenger service over the Panama
    Canal Railway.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy-three
    percent owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR
    rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport,
    Louisiana, which is the portion of the KCSR rail line between
    Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian
    Speedway.”



Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) through its
    wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad
    Company, owns the remaining twenty-seven percent of MSLLC.
    Ultimately KCS will own seventy percent and NS will own thirty
    percent of MSLLC upon the contribution of additional capital by
    NS to MSLLC or its subsidiaries;

•

PABTEX I, L.P., a wholly-owned and consolidated owner of a
    bulk materials handling facility with deep-water access to the
    Gulf of Mexico at Port Arthur, Texas that stores and transfers
    petroleum coke from rail cars to ships, primarily for export;

•

Trans-Serve, Inc. (doing business as Superior Tie and Timber), a
    wholly-owned and consolidated operator of a railroad wood tie
    treatment facility;

•

Transfin Insurance, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated
    captive insurance company, providing property, general liability
    and certain other insurance coverage to KCS and its subsidiaries
    and affiliates;

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that leases locomotives and other equipment; and

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

MARKETS SERVED

2008 Revenues

Business Mix

Chemical and petroleum.

This sector consists
    of the chemicals, petroleum and plastics channels and includes
    products such as petroleum, petroleum coke, rubber, plastics and
    miscellaneous chemicals. KCS transports these products to
    markets in the southeast and northeast United States and
    throughout Mexico through interchanges with other rail carriers.
    The products within the chemicals and plastics channels are used
    in the automotive, housing and packaging industries as well as
    in the production

of other chemicals and plastic products. KCS hauls petroleum
    products across its network and as petroleum refineries have
    continued to increase their refining capacity, they have
    coordinated with KCS to develop additional long-term storage
    opportunities which complement a fluid freight railroad
    operation.

Industrial and consumer products.

KCS’
    rail lines run through the heart of the southeast United States
    timber-producing region. The Company believes that products
    within the forest products channel made from trees in this
    region are generally less expensive than those from other
    regions due to lower production costs. As a result, southern
    yellow pine products from the southeast are increasingly being
    used at the expense of western producers that have experienced
    capacity reductions because of environmental and public policy
    considerations. KCS serves paper mills directly and indirectly
    through its various short-line connections.

This sector also includes the metal and scrap channel comprised
    of metals and ores such as iron, steel, zinc and copper. The
    majority of metals, minerals and ores mined, and steel produced
    in Mexico are consumed within Mexico. The volume of Mexican
    steel exports fluctuates based on global market prices.
    Higher-end finished products such as steel coils used by Mexican
    manufacturers in automobiles, household appliances and other
    consumer goods are imported to the United States through Nuevo
    Laredo and through the seaports served by KCS’ rail network.

Agriculture and minerals.

The agriculture and
    minerals sector consists primarily of the grain and food
    products channels. Shipper demand for agriculture products is
    affected by competition among sources of grain and grain
    products, as well as price fluctuations in international markets
    for key commodities. In the United States, KCS’ rail lines
    receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for
    delivery to feed mills serving the poultry industry. KCS
    currently serves feed mills along its rail lines throughout the
    midwest and southeast United States and through its marketing
    agreements, KCS has access to sources of corn and other



grain in the Midwest. United States export grain shipments and
    Mexico import grain shipments include primarily corn, wheat, and
    soybeans transported to Mexico via Laredo and to the Gulf of
    Mexico for overseas destinations. Over the long term, export
    grain shipments to Mexico are expected to increase as a result
    of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports and KCS’
    coordinated rail network is well positioned to meet these
    increases in demand. The food products channel consists mainly
    of soybean meal, grain meal, oils, canned goods, and sugar.
    Shipments in the remaining channels consist of a variety of
    products including ores, minerals, clay and glass used across
    North America.

Intermodal.

The intermodal freight business
    consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck
    trailers on behalf of steamship lines, motor carriers, and
    intermodal marketing companies with rail carriers serving as
    long-distance haulers. KCS serves and supports the U.S. and
    Mexican markets, as well as cross border traffic between the
    U.S. and Mexico. In light of the importance of trade
    between Asia and the U.S., the Company believes the port of
    Lázaro Cárdenas continues to be a strategically
    beneficial location for ocean carriers and big box retailers.
    The Asia/U.S. commerce is handled through the port of
    Lázaro Cárdenas in conjunction with cross border
    movement on the single coordinated rail network. Intermodal
    shippers around the world are taking notice of the
    Company’s dedicated premium intermodal service from
    Lázaro Cárdenas to Meridian, Mississippi with
    continuing service to eastern destinations on other railroads.
    Lázaro Cárdenas is providing shippers with a
    cost-effective and efficient alternative to other North American
    west coast ports. The Company also provides premium service to
    customers over its line from Dallas through the “Meridian
    Speedway” — the most direct and least-congested
    transcontinental line in the U.S.

Automotive.

KCS provides rail transportation
    to every facet of the automotive industry supply chain,
    including automotive manufacturers, assembly plants and
    distribution centers throughout North America. Several
    U.S. automakers have moved assembly plants into central
    Mexico to take advantage of access to lower costs which has
    driven a shift in production and distribution patterns from the
    U.S. to Mexico. In addition, KCS transports finished
    vehicles imported from Asia through a distribution facility at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas. As the automotive
    industry shifts production and distribution patterns, KCS is
    poised to serve as a key partner with the automakers, with the
    technology and rail network to quickly adapt to the automotive
    industry’s evolving transportation requirements.

Coal.

KCS hauls unit trains of coal (trains
    transporting a single commodity from one source to one
    destination) for eight electric generating plants in the central
    United States. The coal originates from the Powder River Basin
    in Wyoming and is interchanged to KCS at Kansas City, MO. Coal
    mined in the midwest United States is transported in

non-unit

trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills, steel mills,
    and cement companies. Petroleum coke is also included in the
    coal sector, which KCS transports from refineries in the United
    States to cement companies in Mexico as well as to vessels for
    international distribution through the PABTEX export terminal
    located in Port Arthur, Texas.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The Company’s United States operations are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations generally
    applicable to all businesses. Rail operations are also subject
    to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation
    Board (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of
    Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad
    Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and
    state regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over
    disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and
    services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications
    for line extensions and construction, and consolidation or
    merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers.
    DOT and OSHA each has jurisdiction under several federal
    statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
    operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials.
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, the President of the United
    States signed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law,
    which, among other things, revises hours of service rules for
    train and certain other railroad employees, mandates
    implementation of positive train control (a collision avoidance
    technology that can override locomotive controls and stop a
    train before an accident) at certain locations (including
    wherever toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard
    movements occur or where passenger operations occur) by the end
    of 2015, addresses safety at rail crossings, increases the
    number of safety related employees of the Federal Railroad
    Administration, and increases fines



that may be levied against railroads for safety violations.
    State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with
    respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise regulated by
    federal law.

KCS’ subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state
    and local environmental regulations. These laws cover discharges
    to water, air emissions, toxic substances, and the generation,
    handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and
    hazardous materials. These regulations have the effect of
    increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail
    operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail
    operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and
    other hazardous materials.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican
    operations is overseen by the Secretary of Communications and
    Transportation (“SCT”). The SCT establishes
    regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and is
    responsible for resolving disputes between railways and between
    railways and customers. In addition, KCSM must register its
    maximum rates with the SCT and make regular reports to the SCT
    on investment and traffic volumes. See Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

“Description of the Business —

The KCSM
    Concession

.”

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the
    imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of
    operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or
    the termination of the Concession. KCS believes that all
    facilities which it operates are in substantial compliance with
    applicable environmental laws, regulations and agency
    agreements. There are currently no material legal or
    administrative proceedings pending against the Company with
    respect to any environmental matters and management does not
    believe that continued compliance with environmental laws will
    have any material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition. KCS cannot predict the effect, if any, that
    unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional
    or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have
    on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial condition.

COMPETITION

The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are
    much larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources. Since 1994, there has been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. As a result, the
    railroad industry is now dominated by a few very large carriers.
    The larger western railroads (BNSF Railway Company and Union
    Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are significant
    competitors of KCS because of their substantial resources and
    competitive routes. The ongoing impact of past and future rail
    consolidation is uncertain. However, KCS believes that its
    investments and strategic alliances continue to competitively
    position the Company to attract additional rail traffic
    throughout its rail network.

In November 2005, Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Ferromex”) acquired control of and merged with
    Ferrosur S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”), creating
    Mexico’s largest railway. These merged operations are much
    larger than KCSM, and they serve most of the major ports and
    cities in Mexico and together own fifty percent of FTVM, which
    serves industries located within Mexico City. The merger between
    Ferromex and Ferrosur has been declared illegal by the

Comisión Federal de Competencia

(Mexican Antitrust
    Commission, or “COFECO”). Both Ferromex and Ferrosur
    have challenged this ruling.

The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge
    lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain
    routes in KCS’ operating areas. In the past, truck carriers
    have generally eroded the railroad industry’s share of
    total transportation revenues. Intermodal traffic and certain
    other traffic face highly price sensitive competition,
    particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers,
    including KCS,



have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal
    marketplace and working with motor carriers to provide
    end-to-end transportation of products.

While deregulation of U.S. freight rates has enhanced the
    ability of railroads to compete with each other and with
    alternative modes of transportation, this increased competition
    has generally resulted in downward pressure on freight rates.
    Competition with other railroads and other modes of
    transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the
    quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality
    of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities.

EMPLOYEES
    AND LABOR RELATIONS

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
    to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures (which
    include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of
    presidential intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations
    with the various unions generally take place over an extended
    period of time and the Company rarely experiences work stoppages
    during negotiations. Wages, health and welfare benefits, work
    rules and other issues have traditionally been addressed during
    these negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carrier’s Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees had been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated on November 1, 2004, which
    concluded in the fourth quarter of 2008. Long term settlement
    agreements were reached during 2007 and 2008 covering all of
    KCSR’s unionized work force through January 1, 2010.
    There were no settlements that had a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997, between KCSM and the Sindicato
    de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana
    (Mexican Railroad Union), for a term of 50 years, for the
    purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties and
    improving conditions for the union employees. Approximately 80%
    of KCSM employees are covered by this labor agreement. The
    compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to
    renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms are subject
    to negotiation every two years. Compensation terms and other
    benefits have been renegotiated and KCSM finalized these terms
    with the union during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the
    exception of the KCSM retirement benefit which is still under
    negotiations. The union labor negotiation with the Mexican
    Railroad Union has not historically resulted in any strike,
    boycott, or other disruption in KCSM’s business operations
    and there were no settlements that had a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
    Data — Note 1 “Description of the
    Business” and Note 16 “Geographic
    Information” for more information on the description and
    general development of the Company’s business and financial
    information about geographic areas.

RAIL
    SECURITY

The Company and its rail subsidiaries have made a concentrated,
    multi-disciplinary effort since the terrorist attacks on the
    United States on September 11, 2001, to continue securing
    the Company’s assets and personnel against the risk of
    terrorism and other homeland security incidents. Many of the
    specific measures the Company utilizes for these efforts are
    required to be kept confidential through arrangements with
    government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security
    (“DHS”), or through jointly-developed and implemented
    strategies and plans with connecting carriers. To protect the
    confidentiality and sensitivity of the efforts the Company has
    made to safeguard against terrorism and other security
    incidents, the following paragraphs will provide only a general
    overview of some of these efforts. KCSR utilizes a security plan
    based on an industry-wide security plan developed by Association
    of American Railroads (“AAR”) members which focuses on
    comprehensive risk assessments in five areas —
    hazardous materials; train operations; critical



physical assets; military traffic; and information technology
    and communications. The security plan is kept confidential, with
    access to the plan tightly limited to members of management with
    direct security and anti-terrorism implementation
    responsibilities. KCSR participates with other AAR members in
    periodic drills under the industry plan to test and refine its
    various provisions.

KCSR’s security activities range from periodically mailing
    each employee a security awareness brochure (which is also
    posted under the “Employees” tab on the Company’s
    internet website, www.kcsouthern.com) to its ongoing development
    and implementation of security plans for rail facilities in
    areas labeled by the DHS as High Threat Urban Areas
    (“HTUAs”). KCSR’s other activities to bolster
    security against terrorism include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

•

Conferring regularly with other railroads’ security
    personnel and with industry experts on security issues;

•

Analyzing routing alternatives and other strategies to reduce
    the distances that certain chemicals which might be toxic if
    inhaled are transported;

•

Initiating a series of over 20 voluntary action items agreed to
    between AAR and DHS as enhancing security in the rail
    industry; and

•

Including periodic security training as part of the scheduled
    training for operating employees and managers.

In addition, in 2008 the Company created a new leadership role
    titled “Director of Homeland Security” to oversee the
    ongoing and increasingly complex security efforts of the Company
    in both the United States and Mexico. The Company identified and
    retained an individual to fill the position who has an extensive
    law enforcement background, including being formerly employed as
    an analyst with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
    (“FBI”) for 12 years. This member of management
    remains a member of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force
    and is a valuable asset to the Company in implementing and
    developing anti-terrorism and other security initiatives.

During 2008, KCSR worked toward implementation of DHS’s
    Transport Worker Identification Card program for those employees
    requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities,
    and toward implementation of a contractor background check
    program for contractor employees having access to certain
    Company facilities. KCS expects this program to be fully
    implemented during 2009.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Related to an Investment in KCS’ Common Stock

The
    price of KCS’ common stock may fluctuate significantly,
    which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock
    when they want to or at prices they find
    attractive.

The price of KCS’ common stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange (“NYSE”), listed under the ticker symbol
    “KSU”, constantly changes. The Company expects that
    the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can fluctuate as a result of a
    variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCS’ control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

quarterly variations in operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management,
    securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts, ratings
    agencies and investors;

•

developments generally affecting the railroad industry;

•

announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant
    contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint
    ventures or capital commitments;

•

the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings
    against KCS;

•

KCS’ dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of
    dividends;

•

future sales of KCS’ equity or equity-linked securities;

•

the issuance of common stock in payment of dividends on
    preferred stock or upon conversion of preferred stock; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions including
    the availability of short- and long-term financing.

In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has
    experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to
    the operating performance of a particular company. These broad
    market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS’
    ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock is currently
    restricted, and KCS does not anticipate paying cash dividends on
    its common stock in the foreseeable future.

KCS has agreed, and may agree in the future, to restrictions on
    its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock. In
    addition, to maintain its credit ratings, the Company may be
    limited in its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock
    so that it can maintain an appropriate level of debt. During the
    first quarter of 2000, the Board of Directors suspended common
    stock dividends. KCS does not anticipate making any cash
    dividend payments to its common stockholders in the foreseeable
    future.

Holders
    of the Series D Preferred Stock may have special voting
    rights if KCS fails to pay dividends on that preferred stock
    over a stated number of quarters.

If dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears
    for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number of days in
    the aggregate, whether or not consecutive), holders of the
    Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two of
    the authorized number of directors at the next annual
    stockholders’ meeting at which directors are elected and at
    each subsequent stockholders’ meeting until such time as
    all accumulated dividends are paid on the Series D
    Preferred Stock or set aside for payment. In addition, so long
    as dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock remain unpaid
    and for a period thereafter, KCS will not be eligible to
    register



future offerings of securities on

Form S-3

or to avail itself of the other benefits available to companies
    that qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” under
    SEC rules, which could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    access capital markets and increase the cost of accessing
    capital markets.

Sales
    of substantial amounts of KCS’ common stock in the public
    market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the
    common stock.

As of December 31, 2008, there were 9,306,390 shares
    of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan,
    the 2008 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 2,076,919 shares of common
    stock held by executive officers and directors outside those
    plans, and 6,999,826 shares of common stock reserved for
    issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of
    convertible preferred stock. Sales of common stock by employees
    upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and
    directors subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act, and sales of common stock that may be issued
    upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the
    perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the
    market price of KCS’ common stock.

KCS
    has provisions in its charter, bylaws and Rights Agreement that
    could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a
    controlling interest in KCS and that could deprive an investor
    of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or
    prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties, including
    provisions providing for a classified board and supermajority
    stockholder approval requirements in order to increase the size
    of the board of directors, abolish cumulative voting, abolish
    the classification of the Board, or effect certain merger,
    consolidation or sale transactions. The bylaws provide that a
    stockholder must give the Company advance written notice of its
    intent to nominate a director or raise a matter at an annual
    meeting. In addition, the Company has adopted a Rights Agreement
    which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the
    ability of third parties to acquire control of KCS without prior
    approval of the Board of Directors. These provisions may deprive
    KCS’ stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at
    a premium over prevailing market prices.

The
    failure of a bank to fund a request (or any portion of such
    request) by KCS to borrow money under one of its existing
    revolving credit facilities could reduce KCS’ ability to
    fund capital expenditures or otherwise properly fund its
    operations.

The Company’s subsidiaries have existing revolving credit
    facilities with several banking institutions. If any of the
    banking institutions that are a party to such credit facilities
    fails to fund a request (or any portion of such request) by any
    such subsidiary to borrow money under one of these existing
    credit facilities, KCS’ ability to fund capital
    expenditures, fund its operations and pay debt service could be
    reduced, each of which could result in a decline in the value of
    a stockholder’s investment in the Company.

The
    failure of any bank in which the Company deposits funds could
    reduce the amount of cash the Company has available to pay
    distributions and make additional investments.

Given the recent developments in the subprime mortgage and other
    financial markets, financial institutions have additional
    capital risks. The Company has diversified cash and cash
    equivalents among several banking institutions in an attempt to
    minimize exposure to any one of these entities. However, the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or “FDIC,” only
    insures amounts up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank.
    KCS currently has cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
    deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of
    federally insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in
    which KCS has deposited funds ultimately fails, the Company may
    lose its deposits to the extent they are in excess of $250,000.
    The loss of the Company’s deposits could reduce the amount
    of cash the Company has available to distribute or invest and
    could result in a decline in the value of each
    stockholder’s investment in the Company.



Risks
    Related to KCS’ Business

KCS
    competes against other railroads and other transportation
    providers.

The Company’s domestic and international operations are
    subject to competition from other railroads, particularly the
    Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) and BNSF Railway
    Company (“BNSF”) in the United States and Ferromex in
    Mexico, as well as from truck carriers and from barge lines and
    other maritime shippers. Many of KCS’ rail competitors are
    much larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources than KCS, which may enable rail competitors to reduce
    rates and make KCS’ freight services less competitive.
    KCS’ ability to respond to competitive pressures by
    matching rate reductions and decreasing rates without adversely
    affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on,
    among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs.
    KCS’ failure to respond to competitive pressures, and
    particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operation and financial condition.

In recent years, there has also been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. The resulting merged
    railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to
    block other railroads’ access to efficient gateways and
    routing options that are currently and have been historically
    available. There can be no assurance that further consolidation
    in the railroad industry, whether in the United States or
    Mexico, will not have an adverse effect on operations.

Trucking, maritime, and barge competitors, while able to provide
    rate and service competition to the railroad industry, are able
    to use public rights-of-way, require substantially smaller
    capital investment and maintenance expenditures than railroads
    and allow for more frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing
    competitive pressures, any reduction in margins due to
    competitive pressures, future improvements that increase the
    quality of alternative modes of transportation in the locations
    in which the Company operates, or legislation or regulations
    that provide motor carriers with additional advantages, such as
    increased size of vehicles and reduced weight restrictions,
    could result in downward pressure on freight rates, which in
    turn could have a material adverse effect on results of
    operations, financial condition and liquidity.

A central part of KCS’ growth strategy is based upon the
    conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance
    the Company will have the ability to convert traffic from truck
    to rail transport or that the customers already converted will
    be retained. If the railroad industry in general, and the
    Mexican operations in particular, are unable to preserve their
    competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry,
    projected revenue growth from the Mexican operations could be
    adversely affected. Additionally, the revenue growth
    attributable to the Mexican operations could be affected by,
    among other factors, an expansion in the availability, or an
    improvement in the quality, of the trucking services offered by
    Mexican carriers resulting from regulatory and administrative
    interpretations and implementation of certain provisions of the
    North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), and
    KCS’ inability to grow its existing customer base and
    capture additional cargo transport market share because of
    competition from the shipping industry and other railroads.

The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to competition
    from, among others, Ferromex and Ferrosur. Through KCSM’s
    Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM is required to
    grant certain trackage rights to these railroads, the exercise
    of which results in the loss to KCSM of the capacity of using a
    portion of its tracks at all times, and allows the
    Company’s competitors to compete with KCSM over its rails
    lines for traffic between Mexico City and the United States, as
    well as gain more efficient access to certain Mexico City
    industries. In particular, the rail lines operated by Ferromex
    are in close proximity to KCSM’s operations, running from
    Guadalajara and Mexico City to four United States border
    crossings west of the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo crossing, and
    providing an alternative to KCSM’s routes for the transport
    of freight from those cities to the United States border.
    Ferromex additionally directly competes with KCSM in some areas
    of its service territory, including Tampico, Saltillo,
    Monterrey, and Mexico City. Ferrosur competes directly with KCSM
    for traffic to and from southeastern Mexico. Ferrosur, like
    KCSM, also services Mexico City and Puebla.

In November 2005, Grupo México, the controlling shareholder
    of Ferromex, acquired all of the shares of Ferrosur. The merger
    between Ferromex and Ferrosur has been declared illegal by the
    Mexican Antitrust



Commission, a ruling that has been challenged by both Ferromex
    and Ferrosur. On January 29, 2009 KCSM received notice
    of the Mexican Antitrust Commission’s decision holding that
    Ferromex and Ferrosur had engaged in monopolistic practices by
    combining their operations. Under Mexican law, Ferromex and
    Ferrosur have thirty business days to appeal this decision. If
    Ferromex and Ferrosur are successful in this appeal and are
    permitted to combine their operations, giving Grupo México
    control over a nationwide railway system in Mexico and ownership
    of 50% of the shares of FTVM, KCSM’s competitive position
    may be materially harmed.

KCS’
    business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on
    agreements with other railroads and third parties.

Operation of KCS’ rail network and its plans for growth and
    expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads
    and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic
    alliances, as well as interchange, trackage rights, haulage
    rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third
    parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage
    the Company does not own. KCS’ ability to provide
    comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large
    part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with other
    railroads and third parties. The termination of, or the failure
    to renew, these agreements could adversely affect KCS’
    business, financial condition and results of operations. KCS is
    also dependent in part upon the financial health and efficient
    performance of other railroads. For example, some of KCSR’s
    traffic moves over the UP’s lines via trackage rights, a
    significant portion of KCSR’s grain shipments originate
    with another rail carrier pursuant to marketing agreements with
    that carrier, and the UP is KCS’ largest partner in the
    interchange of total rail traffic. There can be no assurance
    that KCS will not be materially adversely affected by
    operational or financial difficulties of other railroads.

KCSM’s
    operations are subject to certain trackage rights, haulage
    rights and interline service agreements with other Mexican rail
    carriers, some of which are in dispute.

Through KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM
    is required to grant short and long-distance trackage rights to
    Ferromex, Ferrosur, and FTVM. Applicable law stipulates that
    Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM similarly are required to grant to
    KCSM rights to use portions of their tracks. Although all of
    these trackage rights have been granted under the Concession, no
    railroad has actually operated under the long-distance trackage
    rights because the rates that may be charged for the right to
    use the tracks has not been agreed upon between KCSM and the
    parties to whom those rights are granted in accordance with the
    Mexican Railroad Services Law and applicable regulations. If
    KCSM cannot reach an agreement on rates with rail carriers
    entitled to trackage rights on KCSM’s rail lines, the SCT
    is entitled to set the rates in accordance with Mexican law and
    regulations, which rates may not adequately compensate KCSM.
    KCSM is currently involved in judicial, civil and commercial
    litigation and administrative proceedings with Ferromex
    regarding the rates payable to each other for trackage rights,
    interline services and haulage rights. Certain of these disputes
    continue under litigation, which KCSM expects to continue over
    the next few years. KCSM and Ferromex are also parties to
    various ongoing civil and administrative cases involving
    disputes over the application and proper interpretation of the
    mandatory trackage rights. Any resolution of such procedures
    adverse to KCSM could have a negative impact on its
    business and operations.

KCS’
    debt capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage of total
    debt plus equity) is 52.2%. KCS’ leverage could adversely
    affect its ability to fulfill obligations under various debt
    instruments and operate its business.

KCS’ level of debt could make it more difficult for it to
    borrow money in the future, may reduce the amount of money
    available to finance operations and other business activities,
    exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates,
    makes it more vulnerable to general economic downturns and
    adverse industry conditions, and could reduce flexibility in
    planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic
    conditions. KCS’ failure to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants in its debt instruments, which,
    among other things, require KCS to maintain specified financial
    ratios and limit its ability to incur debt and sell assets,
    could result in an event of default that, if not cured or
    waived, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not
    have enough cash to service its debt,



meet other obligations and fund other liquidity needs, KCS may
    be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from
    lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling
    assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing
    debt, or seeking additional equity capital. KCS cannot assure
    that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially
    reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of existing
    or future debt agreements may restrict the Company from adopting
    some of these alternatives.

The indebtedness of KCSM exposes it to risks of exchange rate
    fluctuations because any devaluation of the peso would cause the
    cost of KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase and
    could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico,
    compared to Mexican competitors that have less debt and greater
    operating and financial flexibility than KCSM does.

The
    recent downturn in the credit markets has increased the cost of
    borrowing and has made financing difficult to obtain, each of
    which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations and business.

Recent events in the financial markets have had an adverse
    impact on the credit markets and, as a result, credit has become
    more expensive and difficult to obtain. Some lenders are
    imposing more stringent restrictions on the terms of credit and
    there may be a general reduction in the amount of credit
    available in the markets in which KCS conducts business. The
    negative impact of tightening credit markets and the recent
    adverse changes in the credit markets generally may have a
    material adverse effect on KCS’ business and results of
    operations resulting from, but not limited to, an inability to
    finance capital expansion on favorable terms, if at all,
    increased financing costs or financial terms with increasingly
    restrictive covenants.

KCS’
    business is capital intensive.

The Company’s business is capital intensive and requires
    substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things,
    additions and improvements to roadway, structures and
    technology, acquisitions, and maintenance and repair of
    equipment and the rail system. KCS’ failure to make
    necessary capital expenditures to maintain its operations could
    impair its ability to serve existing customers or accommodate
    increases in traffic volumes.

KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund capital
    expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, equipment
    leases, and debt financing. KCS may not be able to generate
    sufficient cash flows from its operations or obtain sufficient
    funds from external sources to fund capital expenditure
    requirements. Even if financing is available, it may not be
    obtainable on acceptable terms and within the limitations
    contained in the indentures and other agreements relating to
    KCS’ existing debt. In light of current economic
    conditions, KCS has taken measures to reduce planned capital
    spending and other expenditures in 2009, and may make further
    reductions to its 2009 capital spending plan to achieve positive
    free cash flow if economic conditions do not improve.

KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM
    fails to make such capital investments, KCSM’s business
    plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk,
    requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no
    assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by
    the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business
    plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not
    grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with
    the capital investment commitments in its business plan could
    result in sanctions imposed by the SCT, and could result in
    revocation of the Concession if sanctions are imposed on five
    distinct occasions. The Company cannot assure that the Mexican
    government would grant any such permission or waiver. If such
    permission or waiver is not obtained in any instance and KCSM is
    sanctioned, its Concession might be at risk of revocation, which
    would materially adversely affect KCS’ financial condition
    and results of operations. See “KCSM’s Mexican
    Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain
    circumstances” below.

KCS’
    business may be adversely affected by changes in general
    economic, weather or other conditions.

KCS’ operations may be adversely affected by changes in the
    economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that
    produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The
    relative strength or weakness



of the United States and Mexican economies affect the businesses
    served by KCS. Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global
    economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the
    financial and credit markets, including the availability of
    short and long-term debt financing, may affect KCS, as well as
    the producers and consumers of the commodities that KCS
    transports and may have a material adverse effect on KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In
    particular, KCS’ financial performance depends, in part, on
    conditions in the automotive industry. Automobile manufacturers
    are among KCSM’s most significant customers, together
    representing approximately 12% of its total revenues in 2008.
    Automobile manufacturers have experienced declining market
    shares in North America and have announced significant
    restructuring actions in an effort to improve profitability
    including temporarily stopping production in December 2008
    and early 2009. If KCS’ automobile manufacturing customers
    cannot fund their operations, or if other major customers reach
    a similar level of financial distress, KCS may incur significant
    write offs of accounts receivable or incur impairment charges.
    In addition, cost-cutting initiatives adopted by automotive
    customers may result in increased downward pressure on the rates
    that KCS may charge. Pricing pressures may further intensify as
    automobile manufacturers continue to pursue restructuring and
    cost-cutting initiatives. KCSM’s automotive revenues
    decreased by approximately 4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and decreased by approximately 31% for
    the three months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the
    same periods in 2007. A prolonged downturn in the North American
    automotive industry resulting in decreased demand or reduced
    rates for the transport of automotive products could have a
    negative impact on KCS’ business, financial condition and
    operating results.

PCRC is directly affected by the world economy and trans-Pacific
    trade flows. In addition, KCS’ investments in Mexico and
    Panama expose the Company to risks associated with operating in
    Mexico and Panama, including, among others, cultural
    differences, varying labor, regulatory and operating practices,
    political risk and differences between the United States,
    Mexican and Panamanian economies. Historically, a stronger
    economy has resulted in improved results for KCS’ rail
    transportation operations. Conversely, when the economy has
    slowed, results have been less favorable. If an economic
    slowdown or recession occurs in key markets, the volume of rail
    shipments is likely to be reduced, which could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business and financial condition.

The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally
    tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although
    transportation markets are affected by general economic
    conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each
    particular market segment that may influence operating results.
    Some of KCS’ customers do business in industries that are
    highly cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive, housing
    and agriculture industries. Any downturn in these industries
    could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also,
    some of the products transported have had a historical pattern
    of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the
    general economic environment and by industry capacity and
    demand. For example, global steel and petrochemical prices have
    decreased in the past, and reduced demand for automotive
    vehicles and related shipments may result in decreased prices.
    KCS cannot assure that prices and demand for these products will
    not decline in the future, adversely affecting those industries
    and, in turn, the Company’s financial condition or results.

The Company’s operations may also be affected by natural
    disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in
    and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, and its
    facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and
    other extreme weather conditions that adversely affect KCS’
    shipping, agricultural, chemical and other customers. Many of
    the goods and commodities transported by KCS experience cyclical
    demand. KCS’ results of operations can be expected to
    reflect this cyclical demand because of the significant fixed
    costs inherent in railroad operations. Significant reductions in
    the volume of rail shipments due to economic, weather, or other
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on KCS’
    business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
    flows.

KCS is
    exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties
    and their failure to meet their financial obligations could
    adversely affect KCS’ business.

KCS’ business is subject to credit risk. There is a risk
    that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its
    obligations when due. Customers and counterparties that owe the
    Company money may default on their



obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity,
    operational failure or other reasons. Although the Company has
    procedures for reviewing its receivables and credit exposures to
    specific customers and counterparties to address present credit
    concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances
    that are difficult to detect or foresee. Some of the
    Company’s risk management methods depend upon the
    evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other
    matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by
    the Company. That information may not, in all cases, be
    accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. In
    addition, concerns about, or a default by, one customer or
    counterparty could lead to significant liquidity problems,
    losses or defaults by other customers or counterparties, which
    in turn could adversely affect the Company. The Company may be
    materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant
    default by its customers and counterparties.

KCS’
    business is subject to regulation by international, federal,
    state and local regulatory agencies, including environmental,
    health, and safety laws and regulations that could require KCS
    to incur material costs or liabilities relating to
    environmental, health, or safety compliance or remediation.
    KCS’ failure to comply with these regulations could have a
    material adverse effect on its operations.

KCS is subject to governmental regulation by international,
    federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to its
    railroad operations, including the Department of Transportation
    and the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and
    the Secretary of Communications and Transportation in Mexico, as
    well as a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and
    other matters. Government regulation of the railroad industry is
    a significant determinant of the competitiveness and
    profitability of railroads. As part of the Rail Safety
    Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, railroad carriers
    must implement positive train control (a collision avoidance
    technology that can override locomotive controls and stop a
    train before an accident) at certain locations (including
    wherever toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard
    movements occur or where passenger operations occur) by the end
    of 2015, which could add to operating costs, increase the number
    of employees the Company employs and require KCS to invest
    significant amounts of money into new safety technology.
    KCS’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    liquidity and operations, including limitations on operating
    activities until compliance with applicable requirements is
    achieved. These government agencies may change the legislative
    or regulatory framework within which the Company operates
    without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on its
    business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally,
    some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain
    various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure
    to maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations
    could adversely affect KCS’ business.

From time to time, certain KCS facilities have not been in
    compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and
    regulations and there can be no assurance that KCS will always
    be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.
    Environmental liability under federal and state law in the
    United States can also extend to previously owned or operated
    properties, leased properties and properties owned by third
    parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by
    the Company. Environmental liabilities may also arise from
    claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties.
    Given the nature of its business, the Company incurs, and
    expects to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs,
    including, in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance
    with requirements governing chemical and hazardous material
    shipping operations, refueling operations and repair facilities.
    KCS presently has environmental investigation and remediation
    obligations at certain sites, and will likely incur such
    obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities
    accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s
    best estimate of the probable future obligation for the
    remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded
    liability is the best estimate of all probable costs,

clean-up

costs cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and may
    exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving
    environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the
    extent of other parties’ participation, developments in
    environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective
    action that may ultimately be required. New laws and
    regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements,
    accidental spills, releases or violations or the discovery of
    previously unknown contamination could require KCS to incur
    costs or subject KCS to liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business, results of operations,
    financial condition, and cash flows.



The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican
    federal and state laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment, including standards for, among
    other things, water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise
    pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling
    of hazardous and solid waste. Under applicable Mexican law and
    regulations, administrative and criminal proceedings may be
    brought and economic sanctions imposed against companies that
    violate environmental laws, and non-complying facilities may be
    temporarily or permanently closed. KCSM is also subject to the
    laws of various jurisdictions and international conferences with
    respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and
    to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments
    of each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities
    are located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the
    Mexican government also impose environmental compliance
    obligations on KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if
    any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of
    additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations
    would have on KCSM’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial condition. Failure to comply with any environmental
    laws or regulations may result in the termination of KCSM’s
    Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect
    profitability.

KCS,
    as a common carrier by rail, is required by United States and
    Mexican laws to transport hazardous materials, which could
    expose KCS to significant costs and claims.

Under United States Federal statutes and Mexican applicable
    laws, KCS’s common carrier responsibility requires it to
    transport hazardous materials. Any rail accident or other
    incident or accident on KCS’s network, facilities, or at
    the facilities of KCS’s customers involving the release of
    hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard (or TIH)
    materials, could involve significant costs and claims for
    personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties
    and remediation, which could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’s results of operations, financial condition, and
    liquidity.

KCS’
    business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and disruptions in
    fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the cost of fuel that
    is not adequately covered by fuel surcharges, or severe
    disruption of fuel supplies, would have a material adverse
    effect on KCS’ business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and
    these costs represent a significant portion of its
    transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel
    may have a material adverse effect on operating results. Fuel
    expense increased from 20% of consolidated operating costs
    during 2007 to 22% of consolidated operating costs during 2008.
    KCS has been able to pass the majority of these fuel cost
    increases on to customers in the form of fuel surcharges applied
    either in the form of an increase in the freight rate or direct
    customer billings. If KCS is unable to recapture its costs of
    fuel from its customers, operating results could be materially
    adversely affected. In addition, a severe disruption of fuel
    supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a
    disruption of oil imports, weather events, war, or otherwise,
    and the resulting impact on fuel prices could materially
    adversely affect KCS’ operating results, financial
    condition, and cash flows.

KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel
    requirements for its Mexican operations almost exclusively
    through purchases at market prices from PEMEX Refinanción
    (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico, a
    government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the
    distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to
    a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration. Either
    party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written
    notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is
    terminated and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from
    alternate sources on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations
    could be materially adversely affected.

Market
    fluctuations could adversely impact KCS’s operating results
    as it hedges certain transactions.

From time to time, KCS may use various financial instruments to
    reduce its exposure to various market risks including interest
    rates and fuel prices. While these financial instruments reduce
    our exposure to changes in market risks, the use of such
    instruments may ultimately limit the Company’s ability to
    benefit from lower fuel prices or interest rates due to amounts
    fixed at the time of entering into the hedge agreement.



The
    loss of key personnel could negatively affect
    business.

KCS’ success substantially depends on its ability to
    attract and retain key members of the senior management team and
    the principals of its foreign subsidiaries. Recruiting,
    motivating, and retaining qualified management personnel,
    particularly those with expertise in the railroad industry, are
    vital to operations and success. There is substantial
    competition for qualified management personnel and there can be
    no assurance that KCS will always be able to attract or retain
    qualified personnel. Employment agreements with senior
    management are terminable at any time by either party. If KCS
    loses one or more of these key executives or principals, its
    ability to successfully implement its business plans and the
    value of its common stock could be materially adversely affected.

A
    majority of KCS’ employees belong to labor unions. Strikes
    or work stoppages could adversely affect
    operations.

The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with
    various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of KCSR’s and
    KCSM’s employees were covered by labor contracts subject to
    collective bargaining. The Company may be subject to, among
    other things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a
    result of disputes under these collective bargaining agreements
    and labor contracts or KCS’ potential inability to
    negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United
    States, because such agreements are generally negotiated on an
    industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions
    of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond
    KCS’ control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and
    conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a
    material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows. If the unionized workers in the United
    States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or
    other slowdown, if other employees were to become unionized, or
    if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
    renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of
    its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the
    U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of
    United States railway workers to strike, there is no law in
    Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway
    workers in that country to strike.

KCS
    faces possible catastrophic loss and liability and its insurance
    may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages to
    others.

The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk
    of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision, and property
    loss. In the course of KCS’ operations, spills or other
    environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business
    interruption due to political developments, as well as labor
    disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result
    in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs.
    Collisions, environmental mishaps, or other accidents can cause
    serious bodily injury, death, and extensive property damage,
    particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated
    areas. Additionally, KCS’ operations may be affected from
    time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes,
    volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of
    a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ operations and financial condition. The Company
    maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice
    against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of
    its business and business interruption due to natural disaster.
    However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on
    coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against.
    This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCS’ damages
    or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be
    available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, KCS is
    subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become
    insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in
    the future. Even with insurance, if any catastrophic
    interruption of service occurs, KCS may not be able to restore
    service without a significant interruption to operations which
    could have an adverse effect on KCS’ financial condition.

KCS’
    business may be affected by future acts of terrorism or
    war.

Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s
    chemical transportation activities, any government response
    thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
    These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise
    capital or its future business



opportunities. KCS’ rail lines and facilities could be
    direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which
    could cause significant business interruption and result in
    increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In
    addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the
    terrorism coverage currently maintained by KCS could increase
    dramatically or certain coverage may not be available in the
    future.

KCSM’s
    Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating
    its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business and financial condition.

KCSM operates under the Concession granted by the Mexican
    government, which is renewable for up to 50 years, subject
    to certain conditions. The Concession gives KCSM exclusive
    rights to provide freight transportation services over its rail
    lines for 30 years of the

50-year

Concession, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights
    granted to other concessionaires. The SCT, which is principally
    responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, has
    broad powers to monitor KCSM’s compliance with the
    Concession and it can require KCSM to supply it with any
    technical, administrative and financial information it requests.
    Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment
    commitments established in its business plan, which forms an
    integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every
    five years. The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans
    confidentially. The SCT also monitors KCSM’s compliance
    with efficiency and safety standards established in the
    Concession. The SCT reviews, and may amend, these standards
    every five years.

The Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide the
    Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM
    under the Concession, including the right to take over the
    management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary
    cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the
    past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to
    other privatized industries, including the telecommunications
    industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In
    addition, under Article 47 of the Mexican Railroad Services
    Law and its regulations, the SCT, in consultation with the
    Mexican Antitrust Commission, reserves the right to set service
    rates if it determines that effective competition does not exist
    in the Mexican railroad industry. The Mexican Antitrust
    Commission, however, has not published guidelines regarding the
    factors that constitute a lack of competition. It is therefore
    unclear under what particular circumstances the Mexican
    Antitrust Commission would deem a lack of competition to exist.
    If the SCT intervenes and sets service rates, the rates it
    sets may be too low to allow KCSM to operate profitably.

Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail
    lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated
    structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the
    Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain
    assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. All
    other property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it
    for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will also have a right of first refusal with respect
    to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after revocation of the Concession.

The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of
    KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger
    to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may
    restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in such
    manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but
    only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican
    law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it
    effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public
    interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause
    other than international war, the Mexican Railroad Services Law
    and regulations provide that the Mexican government will
    indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to
    damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may
    not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not
    be timely made.

The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is sanctioned on three
    distinct occasions for unjustly interrupting the operation of
    its rail lines or for charging tariffs higher than the tariffs
    it has registered with the SCT. In addition, the SCT may revoke
    the Concession if, among other things, KCSM is sanctioned on
    five



distinct occasions because KCSM restricts the ability of other
    Mexican rail operators to use its rail lines; KCSM fails to make
    payments for damages caused during the performance of services;
    KCSM fails to comply with any term or condition of the Mexican
    Railroad Services Law and regulations or the Concession;
    KCSM fails to make the capital investments required under
    its five-year business plan filed with the SCT; or KCSM fails to
    maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage
    as specified in the Mexican Railroad Services Law and
    regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke
    automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or
    creates any lien on the Concession, or if there is a change in
    control of KCSM, without the SCT’s approval. The SCT may
    also terminate the Concession as a result of KCSM’s
    surrender of its rights under the Concession, or for reasons of
    public interest or upon KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy.
    Revocation or termination of the Concession would prevent KCSM
    from operating its railroad and would materially adversely
    affect the Mexican operations and the ability to make payments
    on KCSM’s debt. If the Concession is terminated or revoked
    by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no compensation
    and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures
    covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by
    it, would revert to the Mexican government.

In April 2006, the SCT initiated proceedings against KCSM,
    claiming that KCSM had failed to make certain minimum capital
    investments projected for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year
    business plan filed with the SCT prior to its April 2005
    acquisition by KCS (collectively, the “Capital Investment
    Proceedings”). KCSM believes it made capital expenditures
    exceeding the required amounts. KCSM responded to the SCT by
    providing evidence in support of its investments and explaining
    why it believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May 2007, KCSM
    was served with an SCT resolution regarding the Capital
    Investment Proceeding for 2004, in which the SCT determined that
    KCSM had indeed failed to make the minimum capital investments
    required for such year, but imposed no sanction as such failure
    was KCSM’s first breach of the relevant legal provisions.
    In June 2007, KCSM was served with an SCT resolution regarding
    the Capital Investment Proceeding for 2005, in which the SCT
    determined that KCSM had indeed failed to make the minimum
    capital investments required for such year, and imposed a fine
    in the amount of Ps.46,800. KCSM has filed actions before the
    Mexican Administrative Federal Court challenging both the 2004
    and 2005 investment plan resolutions issued by the SCT, and will
    have the right to challenge any adverse ruling.

KCSM believes that even if sanctions are ultimately imposed as a
    consequence of the Capital Investment Proceedings, there will be
    no material adverse effect on its results of operations or
    financial condition. However, each of these potential sanctions
    is considered a “generic” sanction under Mexican law
    (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not specifically referred to
    in specific subsections of the Mexican railway law). If these
    potential sanctions are conclusively ruled adversely against
    KCSM and sanctions are imposed, and if the SCT imposes other
    sanctions related to KCSM’s capital investments or other
    “generic” sanctions on three additional occasions over
    the remaining term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject to
    possible future SCT action seeking revocation of its Concession.
    Such revocation would materially adversely affect the results of
    operations and financial condition of KCSM.

KCS’
    ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to
    economic and political risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise,
    significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly,
    Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and
    state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on
    Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSM’s
    Mexican operations in particular. KCS cannot predict the impact
    that the political landscape, including the recently implemented
    multiparty rule, will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore,
    KCSM’s financial condition, results of operations and
    prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation,
    interest rates, regulation, taxation, social instability and
    other political, social and economic developments in or
    affecting Mexico.

KCSM uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and
    remeasures its monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    Mexican pesos into its functional currency. In 2008, the Mexican
    peso declined by about 24%, to Ps.13.5 at December 31, 2008
    compared to Ps.10.9 at December 31, 2007. The decrease in
    the peso accounted for the $21.0 million foreign currency
    loss on the Company’s results of operations for the year



ended December 31, 2008. Further weakening of the peso
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business,
    financial condition, and results of operation.

The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment
    deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. Although
    Mexico has imposed foreign exchange controls in the past, there
    are currently no exchange controls in Mexico. Pursuant to the
    provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of
    payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the
    future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange
    controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by
    United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange
    control policy could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    obtain dollars or to convert pesos into dollars for purposes of
    making interest and principal payments due on indebtedness, to
    the extent KCS may have to effect those conversions, and could
    adversely affect the Company’s investment in KCSM. This
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business and
    financial condition.

Mexican national politicians are currently focused on certain
    regional, political and social tensions, and reforms regarding
    fiscal and labor policies, gas, electricity, social security,
    and oil have not been and may not be approved. The social and
    political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican
    economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business, financial condition, and results of
    operation.

Securities of companies in emerging market countries tend to be
    influenced by economic and market conditions in other emerging
    market countries. Some emerging market countries, including
    Argentina and Brazil, have experienced significant economic
    downturns and market volatility in the past. These events have
    had an adverse effect on the economic conditions and securities
    markets of other emerging market countries, including Mexico.

Downturns
    in the United States economy or in trade between the United
    States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar
    exchange rate would likely have adverse effects on KCS’
    business and results of operations.

The level and timing of KCS’ Mexican business activity is
    heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican
    trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican
    operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets
    for the products KCSM transports, the relative position of
    Mexico and the United States in these markets at any given
    time, and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the
    United States or Mexican economy or in trade between the United
    States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on KCS’
    business results of operations and the Company’s ability to
    meet debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has invested
    significant amounts in developing its intermodal operations at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, in part to provide Asian
    importers with an alternative to the west coast ports of the
    United States, and the level of intermodal traffic depends, to
    an extent, on the volume of Asian shipments routed through
    Lázaro Cárdenas. Reduction in trading volumes between
    KCS and its Asian customers, which may be caused by factors
    beyond KCS’ control, including increased government
    regulations in light of recent concerns regarding the safety and
    quality of Asian-manufactured products, may adversely affect
    KCS’ business and results of operations.

Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates could lead
    to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and
    exports. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the value of the
    Mexican peso declined significantly against the
    U.S. dollar. See “KCS’ ownership of KCSM and
    operations in Mexico subject it to economic and political
    risks” above. Although a decrease in the level of exports
    of some of the commodities that KCSM transports to the United
    States may be offset by a subsequent increase in imports of
    other commodities KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any
    offsetting increase might not occur on a timely basis, if at
    all. Future developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond
    the Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight
    volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and
    commodities KCSM carries.

Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of
    KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely
    affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness.
    Severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may result in
    disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may
    limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of
    interest and



principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness. Although the
    Mexican government currently does not restrict, and for many
    years has not restricted, the right or ability of Mexican or
    foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of
    Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute
    restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability
    to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other
    currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the
    U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments.
    Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the
    U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar
    prices for KCS’ securities. Currency fluctuations are
    likely to continue to have an effect on KCS’ financial
    condition in future periods.

Mexico
    may experience high levels of inflation in the future which
    could adversely affect KCS’ results of
    operations.

Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation and may
    experience high inflation in the future. During most of the
    1980s and during the mid and late 1990s, Mexico experienced
    periods of high levels of inflation. The annual rates of
    inflation for the last three years, as measured by changes in
    the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by Banco de
    Mexico, were 6.5% in 2008, 3.8% in 2007 and 4.0% in 2006. A
    substantial increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have
    the effect of increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could
    adversely affect its results of operations and financial
    condition. High levels of inflation may also affect the balance
    of trade between Mexico and the United States, and other
    countries, which could adversely affect KCSM’s results of
    operations.

Risk
    Factors Relating to Ongoing Litigation

KCS is party to various legal proceedings and administrative
    actions arising in the ordinary course of business including
    those specifically mentioned below:

KCSR
    may be renamed as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit
    that may divert management’s attention from the
    Company’s business, cause the Company to incur substantial
    expenses, and in the event of an adverse result expose the
    Company to significant damages and penalties.

As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

KCSR was included along with several other major
    U.S. railroads in 29 putative class actions alleging that
    the individual railroads conspired to fix fuel surcharges in
    violation of U.S. antitrust laws. On November 27,
    2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered
    that these putative class action cases be consolidated for
    pretrial handling before the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia, where the matters remain pending (the
    “Multidistrict Litigation”). All of the plaintiffs in
    the Multidistrict Litigation filed a consolidated amended
    complaint on April 15, 2008. KCSR was not named as a
    defendant in that consolidated amended complaint pursuant to an
    agreement with the Multidistrict Litigation plaintiffs to toll
    the statute of limitations, and the Multidistrict Litigation
    does not include KCSR as a party.

If KCSR is renamed as defendant to this litigation, KCSR intends
    to vigorously defend these claims. While the Company believes
    these price fixing allegations have no merit, no assurance can
    be given regarding the outcomes of these lawsuits. These and
    related matters have required, and will continue to require, the
    Company to incur substantial expenses for legal and other
    professional services. If KCSR is renamed as a party to this
    litigation and found liable in these proceedings, it could be
    required to pay damages (possibly including treble damages) and
    penalties and might face additional remedies that could harm its
    financial condition and operating results.

KCSM
    is involved in several disputes related to providing service to
    a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. auto manufacturer, which if
    adversely resolved could have a negative impact on its business
    and operations.

In March 2008, a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. auto
    manufacturer (the “Auto Manufacturer”) filed an
    arbitration suit against KCSM under a contract entered into in
    1999 for services to the Auto Manufacturer’s plants in
    Mexico, which, as amended, had a stated termination date of
    January 31, 2008. The Auto



Manufacturer claims that the contract was implicitly extended
    and continued in effect beyond its stated termination date, and
    that KCSM is therefore required to continue abiding by its terms
    including but not limited to, the rates contemplated in such
    contract. KCSM claims that the contract did in fact expire on
    its stated termination date of January 31, 2008, and that
    services rendered thereafter are thus subject to the general
    terms and conditions (including rates) applicable in the absence
    of a specific contract, pursuant to Mexican law. Accordingly,
    KCSM filed a counterclaim against the Auto Manufacturer to,
    among other things, recover the applicable rate difference. The
    Auto Manufacturer is also seeking a declaration by the
    arbitrator that the rates being assessed by KCSM are
    discriminatory, even though the rates being charged are within
    the legal rate limits set by Mexican law for such freight
    transportation. KCSM believes that the facts of this dispute
    provide it with strong legal arguments and intends to vigorously
    defend its claims in this proceeding. As a result, management
    believes the final resolution of these claims will not have any
    material impact on KCSM’s results of operations.

In May 2008, the SCT initiated a proceeding against KCSM, at the
    Auto Manufacturer’s request, alleging that KCSM
    impermissibly bundled international rail services and engaged in
    discriminatory pricing practices with respect to rail services
    provided by KCSM to the Auto Manufacturer. If the SCT were to
    determine that KCSM did engage in such actions, the SCT could
    impose sanctions on KCSM. On July 23, 2008, the
    SCT delivered notice to KCSM of new proceedings against
    KCSM, claiming, among other things, that KCSM refused to grant
    Ferromex access to certain trackage over which Ferromex alleges
    it has trackage rights in Coahuila on six different occasions
    and thus denied Ferromex the ability to provide service to the
    Auto Manufacturer at this location.

KCSM does not believe that these SCT proceedings will have a
    material adverse effect on its results of operations or
    financial condition. However, if KCSM is ultimately sanctioned
    in connection with the bundling and discriminatory pricing
    practices alleged by the Auto Manufacturer, any such sanction
    would be considered a “generic” sanction under Mexican
    law (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not specifically
    referred to in specific subsections of the Mexican railway law).
    If challenges against any such sanction are conclusively ruled
    adversely to KCSM and a sanction is effectively imposed, and if
    the SCT imposes other “generic” sanctions on four
    additional occasions over the remaining term of the Concession,
    KCSM could be subject to possible future SCT action seeking
    revocation of its Concession. Likewise, if each of the alleged
    six refusals to allow Ferromex to serve the Auto Manufacturer in
    Coahuila were to be finally decided to warrant a separate
    sanction, KCSM could be subject to a future SCT action seeking
    revocation of its Concession. Revocation of the Concession would
    materially adversely affect KCSM’s results of operations
    and financial condition

Properties

Track
    Configuration

KCSR operates over a railroad system consisting of approximately
    3,200 miles of main and branch lines in ten states
    extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United
    States south into Mexico. Approximately 600 miles of
    KCSR’s system consists of trackage rights that permit KCSR
    to operate its trains with its crews over other railroad’s
    tracks.

Under its Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM has the
    right to operate approximately 2,700 miles of main and
    branch lines, but does not own the land, roadway, or associated
    structures and has approximately 700 miles of trackage
    rights. The Concession requires KCSM to make investments as
    described in a business plan filed every five years with the
    Mexican government. KCSM may defer capital expenditures with
    respect to its five-year business plan with the permission of
    the SCT. However, should the SCT not grant this permission,
    KCSM’s failure to comply with the commitments in its
    business plan could result in fines and ultimately the Mexican
    government revoking the Concession. See Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors — KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to
    revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would
    prevent KCSM from



operating its railroad and would have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s business and financial condition.”

Market
    Information.

The Company’s Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the ticker symbol “KSU”. Information as
    to the high and low sales price of the Company’s common and
    preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007 is set forth in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

and is incorporated by reference herein.

Dividend
    Policy.

Common Stock.

KCS has not declared any cash
    dividends on its common stock during the last five fiscal years
    and it does not anticipate making any cash dividend payments to
    common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Pursuant to
    KCSR’s credit agreement, KCS is prohibited from the payment
    of cash dividends on its common stock.

Preferred Stock.

Kansas City Southern is
    restricted from paying dividends on its Series D Preferred
    Stock when its coverage ratio (as defined in the indentures for
    KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes, 8.0% Senior Notes, and 13.0% Senior Notes) is
    less than 2.0:1. It is the Company’s intention to pay
    timely dividends on all preferred stock in either cash or stock
    when dividend payments are not restricted under the covenants of
    its various debt agreements and the Company has adequate levels
    of liquidity. In the event that dividends on the Series D
    Preferred Stock are in arrears for six consecutive quarters (or
    an equivalent number of days in the aggregate, whether or not
    consecutive), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, as
    applicable, will be entitled to elect two of the authorized
    number of directors at the next annual stockholders’
    meeting, and at each subsequent stockholders’ meeting until
    such time as all accumulated dividends are paid on the
    Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, or set aside for
    payment.

Holders.

There were 4,772 record holders of KCS common stock on
    February 5, 2009; however, the number of actual holders of
    KCS common stock is greater due to the practice of brokerage
    firms registering many shares for clients in the brokerage
    firm’s name.

Securities
    Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
    Plans.

See Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of
    Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
    Matters” for information about securities authorized for
    issuance under KCS’ equity compensation plans.



Performance
    Graph.

The following graph shows the changes in value over the five
    years ended December 31, 2008, of an assumed investment of
    $100 in: (i) KCS’ common stock; (ii) the stocks
    that comprise the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index(1); and
    (iii) the stocks that comprise the S&P 500 Index(2).
    The table following the graph shows the value of those
    investments on December 31 for each of the years indicated. The
    values for the assumed investments depicted on the graph and in
    the table have been calculated assuming that any cash dividends
    are reinvested.

OTHER
    FINANCIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSED

KCS reports its financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”). The Company’s earnings releases,
    presentations, and

8-K

filings
    use certain non-GAAP measures. These measures should be
    considered in addition to, but not as a substitute or preferable
    to, other information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures used
    to review and in certain cases manage the Company’s
    business may provide its users of the financial information with
    additional meaningful comparison when reviewing the
    Company’s results.

KCS management at times uses non-GAAP information in its
    planning and forecasting processes and to further analyze its
    own financial trends and operational performance, as well as
    making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a
    similar basis. The Company also uses some of these measures
    internally as part of its incentive compensation plans for
    management employees. Management believes investors and users of
    the Company’s financial information should consider all of
    the above factors when evaluating KCS’ results and believes
    these can be particularly useful in assessing comparability of
    the Company’s performance for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Non-GAAP financial information previously disclosed by the
    Company used in earnings releases, presentations, or other
    materials can be found on its website in the investor relations
    section of content. Some of KCS’ non-GAAP measures may
    differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if
    similar terms are used to identify such measures.



Item 7.

Management’s

Segment
    Information.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company aligned its segments
    into one reportable segment to reflect the strategic focus on
    its single coordinated network. Prior to January 1, 2008,
    the Company reported two segments. Prior period segment
    information has been recast to conform to the current year
    presentation.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

    Financial Overview.

During 2008, KCS continued to realize operational improvement
    across its entire network with a continued management focus on
    execution and realizing the full value of the coordinated
    network. The Company achieved record revenues of
    $1,852.1 million in 2008, which was a 6% increase over 2007
    revenues despite a 2% decrease in volume due to the slowing
    economy, particularly related to the building materials,
    appliances, and automobile industries. A continued strong
    pricing environment, new business opportunities, and increases
    in fuel surcharges were key drivers of the revenue growth. New
    business originating at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas
    was significant and continues to allow KCS to position its
    network to increase length of haul and cross border traffic.

Operating expenses were $1,461.9 million, an increase of 6%
    over prior year, primarily driven by a 20% increase in fuel
    expense. Excluding the impact of fuel, operating expenses were
    up only 2% as a result of efficiencies from the coordinated
    network and a tighter operating discipline.

Operating income for 2008 was $390.2 million compared with
    $362.4 million last year, an 8% improvement. The operating
    ratio improved from 79.2% in 2007 to 78.9% in 2008. In addition
    to the higher fuel costs, adverse winter weather conditions in
    the first quarter and two hurricanes in the third quarter
    affected the Company’s operating performance. Given these
    challenges, and including those posed by global economic
    factors, it is notable that KCS was able to achieve a 6% revenue
    increase for the year, 8% increase in operating income, and a
    slight improvement to the operating ratio.

KCS recorded foreign exchange losses of $21.0 million
    during 2008 compared with a loss of $0.9 million in 2007.
    This loss is attributable to the strengthening U.S. dollar
    against the Mexican peso as the Mexican peso reached a record
    low compared to the U.S. dollar during 2008. At
    December 31, 2008, the Mexican peso was Ps.13.5 per
    U.S. dollar compared to Ps.10.9 per U.S. dollar at
    December 31, 2007, a decline in the peso not seen for over
    a decade.

Capital expenditures are a significant use of cash for KCS and
    were $576.5 million for 2008, a 40% increase over 2007. The
    increase reflects work on and completion of strategic projects
    that continue to help KCS realize the full value of its
    coordinated network.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, revenues increased
    $109.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to
    targeted rate increases, increased fuel surcharge, and new
    business opportunities partially offset by an overall decrease
    in carload volumes. A large portion of the volume decrease in
    2008 was realized in the fourth quarter resulting from the
    global economic slowdown. The following discussion provides an
    analysis of revenues by commodity group.

Revenues by commodity

group for 2008

Chemical and
    petroleum.

Revenues increased $27.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to targeted rate
    increases, fuel surcharge increases, and increased traffic
    volumes from new business primarily in the Plastics channel.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues
    increased $7.5 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 primarily due to higher demand in the Metals and scrap
    channel in coil and pipe products as well as new business within
    the channel, targeted rate increases, and fuel surcharge
    increases. These increases were partially offset by decreases in
    volume due to the declining housing market which impacted the
    Forest products channel and declines in beer export volume from
    Mexico reflected in the Other channel due to a large beer
    producer relocating to an area not served by the KCS network in
    the first quarter of 2008.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased
    $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    driven by targeted rate increases, fuel surcharge increases and
    increased length of haul of cross border traffic from customers
    moving their business from various competitors onto the KCS
    network. The Grain channel accounted for the majority of the
    revenue increase even with a later than forecasted harvest
    decreasing volume. This volume decrease was partially offset by
    increased traffic in the Ores and minerals channel, particularly
    in rock and sand products, due to the strong energy sector.

Intermodal.

Revenues increased
    $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    driven by targeted rate increases and fuel surcharge increases.
    Volumes of imports and exports of intermodal containerized
    business originating and terminating at the port of Lázaro
    Cárdenas increased and were offset by decreases in
    automotive related traffic (parts distribution) as well as
    certain haulage business.

Automotive.

Revenues decreased
    $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Decreases were driven by the overall downturn in the automotive
    industry as higher cost of fuel and tightening credit markets
    have automobile manufacturers re-tooling factories to build more
    fuel efficient vehicles as well as developing programs to incent
    the purchase of new cars. The overall decrease was partially
    offset by targeted rate increases and new longer haul traffic in
    the first half of 2008.

Coal.

Revenue increased $10.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, due to an increase in
    fuel surcharge participation, increased length of haul, rate
    increases, and improved system velocity on coal trains in the
    second half of 2008. The increase was partially offset by lower
    volumes during the first half of 2008 due to higher stockpile
    levels, utility customer maintenance outages, and adverse
    weather in the Midwest affecting deliveries.



Operating
    expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, operating expenses
    increased $81.5 million. The following summarizes the
    Company’s operating expenses

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits decreased $19.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. Increases due to
    annual wage and salary rate increases and severance obligations
    were offset by lower share-based compensation expense as a
    result of forfeitures, decreases in incentive compensation and
    an increase in capitalized overhead rates based on new and
    updated studies.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    increased $14.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to an
    increase in locomotive maintenance expense in Mexico, equipment
    and track structure maintenance expenses, corporate expenses and
    switching costs.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007, primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices,
    partially offset by lower consumption in certain parts of the
    network and increased fuel efficiency driven primarily by older
    locomotives being replaced with new locomotives through a
    strategic initiative in 2007 and 2008.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased
    $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007 due to an increase in locomotive lease expense
    offset by lower car hire expenses.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization increased $9.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to a
    larger asset base reflecting a continued commitment to
    investment in Mexico.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expenses increased $3.7 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 primarily due to
    the lower expense in 2007 from a favorable reinsurance
    litigation settlement received in the second quarter of 2007 and
    damages caused by the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2008,
    partially offset by decreases in personal injury and derailment
    expenses.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    increased $19.1 million for year ended December 31,
    2008, compared to 2007, due to increased materials and supplies
    used for the maintenance of freight cars and locomotives and
    lower sales and use tax in the first quarter of 2007 as a result
    of a favorable tax ruling.

Non-Operating
    Expenses.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower
    interest rates related to debt refinancing as well as lower
    accrued interest for various tax related matters as a result of
    certain settlements in the second quarter of 2008.

Debt Retirement Costs.

Debt retirement costs
    decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In May
    2008, KCSR redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due October 1, 2008 and expensed $5.6 million
    for cash tender offer expenses and unamortized debt issuance
    costs. In June of 2007, KCSM redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012 and entered into a new bank credit



agreement. The charge of $16.7 million for the call premium
    and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated
    with the extinguished debt was partially offset by the
    $9.8 million write off of the unamortized purchase
    accounting fair value effect related to the


/


% Senior
    Notes.

Foreign Exchange.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the foreign exchange loss was
    $21.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively,
    primarily due to fluctuations in the value of the
    U.S. dollar versus Mexican peso exchange rates and a
    cumulative post-acquisition loss of $2.9 million in the
    fourth quarter, which was an out of period adjustment related to
    certain unsettled transactions recorded prior to 2004.

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $18.0 million and
    $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Significant components of this change
    were as follows:

•

Equity in earnings from the operations of PCRC was
    $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2007. The
    increase is primarily due to increased freight revenue driven by
    higher volume from new and existing customers.

•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $5.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
    $4.8 million for the same period in 2007. The increase is
    primarily attributed to increased lease income as well as a
    reduction in interest and administrative expenses.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $4.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
    $2.9 million for the same period in 2007. The increase
    primarily reflects reduced maintenance expense in 2008 and a
    non-recurring prior year loss recorded in 2007.

Other Income.

Other income decreased
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower
    interest and dividend income, and fewer gains on sales of land
    in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007.

Income Tax Expense.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s income tax expense
    was $64.5 million, a change of $2.6 million as
    compared to an expense of $67.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The effective tax rate was 25.9% and
    30.3% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The reduction in the year-over-year effective rate
    reflects changes in foreign exchange rates partially offset by a
    tax asset valuation allowance recorded in Mexico during 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, revenues increased
    $83.1 million compared to the prior year due to targeted
    rate increases partially offset by a decrease in carload volumes
    primarily in the industrial and consumer products sector. The
    following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by
    commodity group.

Revenues by commodity

group for 2007

Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased
    $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    due to targeted rate increases and increased traffic volumes,
    primarily related to soda ash in the chemicals channel and the
    plastics channel, partially offset by a decrease in the
    petroleum channel.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues
    increased $4.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007, due to certain rate increases primarily in the forest
    products channel, partially offset by decreases in volume due to
    the declining housing market which negatively impacted the
    forest products channel.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased
    $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    due to rate increases, an increase in unit train velocity over
    certain corridors increasing capacity, and increased cross
    border business due to higher shipments of grain to Mexico. The
    increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in
    volumes. For the later part of the year, carload volume was
    adversely affected by wetter than normal weather in the southern
    United States slowing shipments and reducing beneficial customer
    inventories.

Intermodal.

Revenues increased
    $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as a
    result of rate increases and continued increases in traffic at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, which were partially
    offset by a reduction in volume related to certain haulage
    business.

Automotive.

Revenues increased
    $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    driven by the continued development and expansion of the
    automotive network in Mexico and increased production of
    U.S. automotives.

Coal.

Revenue increased $18.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, as a result of increased
    rates related to new and updated contracts and overall increases
    in car volumes to electric generating stations driven by strong
    demand.

Operating
    Expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, operating expenses
    increased $25.0 million. The following summarizes the
    Company’s operating expenses

(in millions).

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits increased $0.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to
    annual wage and salary merit increases, new collective
    bargaining agreements effective in the third quarter, and higher
    healthcare costs as compared to the prior year. Increases were
    partially offset by a decrease in the Mexico statutory profit
    sharing expense, increased overhead capitalization due to new
    and updated studies, and a favorable decrease in estimated labor
    costs following certain labor contract negotiations in the first
    half of 2007.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    decreased $20.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a
    reclassification of certain customer switching and transloading
    costs as revenue deductions, partially offset by an increased
    locomotive maintenance program, additional outsourcing of
    related maintenance, and increased cost and use of facilities
    jointly used by the Company and other railroads.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared with 2006, primarily due to increases in the average
    price per gallon of fuel.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased
    $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to 2006, primarily due to a reclassification of
    customer car hire billed at the border, which was reclassified
    to revenues in 2007. These increases were partially offset by
    lower short-term locomotive lease expense due to a reduced
    reliance on short-term leased locomotives driven by improved
    locomotive availability, as well as lower rates on the use of
    certain other short-term leased locomotives.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization increased $5.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006,
    primarily due to a higher capital base, partially offset by
    final adjustments related to the depreciation rate study
    completed in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expenses increased $17.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. The number of
    derailment incidents declined in 2007 compared with the 2006
    period; however, derailment costs were higher due to an increase
    in the severity of certain derailment incidents.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    increased $1.8 million for year ended December 31,
    2007, compared to 2006, due to increased materials and supplies
    used for the maintenance of locomotives and freight cars and
    increased costs related to legal obligations for the removal of
    certain assets at the end of their useful lives, partially
    offset by lower sales and use tax as a result of a favorable
    diesel fuel sales tax ruling in the first quarter of 2007, lower
    state franchise tax expense, and reduced allowances for freight
    receivables primarily due to favorable loss experience and lower
    receivables.

Non-Operating
    Expenses.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    compared to the same period in 2006. Reduced interest expense
    reflects the refinancing of KCSM’s higher rate debt (see
    debt retirement costs for more information), as well as the
    reversal of accrued estimated interest expense related to KCSM
    post-acquisition contingencies settled with TMM in the third
    quarter of 2007.

Debt Retirement Costs.

Debt retirement costs
    increased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007, compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. In June
    of 2007, KCSM redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012 and entered into a new bank credit agreement. As
    a result of these transactions, there was a net
    $6.9 million write-off of debt retirement costs. Included
    in the debt retirement costs was a charge of $16.7 million
    for the call premium on the senior notes, which was partially
    offset by a $9.8 million reduction of unamortized purchase
    accounting effects associated with the


/


% Senior
    Notes. During 2006, KCSR entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement and wrote off $2.2 million of unamortized
    debt issuance costs and KCSM refinanced its


/


% Senior
    Notes and wrote off $2.6 million of unamortized debt
    issuance costs.



Foreign Exchange.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the foreign exchange loss was
    $0.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, due to
    fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus Mexican
    peso exchange rates.

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $11.4 million and
    $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Significant components of this change were
    as follows:

•

Equity in earnings from the operations of PCRC was
    $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Loss in earnings was $1.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to
    increased revenue driven by increasing volume growth.

•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $4.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to
    $5.4 million for the same period in 2006. The decrease
    primarily reflects a reduction in lease income attributed to
    fewer assets being leased than the prior year period.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $2.9 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Other Income.

Other income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 was $12.0 million, which consists
    primarily of miscellaneous interest and dividend income as well
    as gains on sales of land. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, other income was $18.7 million, which consisted of
    miscellaneous interest income, dividend income, royalty income,
    and gains on sales of land and certain other long-term assets
    that were not associated with KCS’ railroad operations.

Income Tax Expense.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, KCS’ income tax expense was
    $67.1 million, a change of $21.7 million as compared
    to an expense of $45.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate increased from
    29.4% to 30.3% for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2007, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is
    attributable to a variation in the ratio of U.S. to foreign
    (lower taxed) earnings.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

KCS’ primary uses of cash are to support operations;
    maintain and improve its railroad and information systems
    infrastructure; pay debt service and preferred stock dividends;
    acquire new and maintain existing locomotives, rolling stock,
    and other equipment used in the operations of KCS; and meet
    other obligations. See “Cash Flow Information and
    Contractual Obligations” below.

As of December 31, 2008, KCS has a debt capitalization
    ratio (total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity) of
    52.2%. Its primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated
    from operations, borrowings under its revolving credit
    facilities and access to debt and equity capital markets.
    Although KCS has had more than adequate access to the capital
    markets, as a non-investment grade company, the financial terms
    under which funding is obtained often contain restrictive
    covenants. The covenants constrain financial flexibility by
    restricting or prohibiting certain actions, including the
    ability to incur additional debt for any purpose other than
    refinancing existing debt, create or suffer to exist additional
    liens, make prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends on
    common stock, make capital investments, engage in transactions
    with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell
    certain assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations or in
    sale-leaseback transactions. On December 31, 2008, total
    available liquidity (the unrestricted cash balance plus
    revolving credit facility availability) was approximately
    $336 million, of which about $200.0 million will be
    used to repurchase the


/


% Senior
    Notes in the first quarter of 2009.

KCSM is subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture
    governing KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes. Most of the restrictive covenants of the indenture were
    eliminated on January 29, 2009 when a new supplemental
    indenture became effective as part of the tender offer and
    consent solicitation for the


/


% Senior
    Notes.

The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as
    of February 13, 2009.



The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash
    and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to capital
    markets, and other available financing resources will be
    sufficient to fund anticipated operating, capital and debt
    service requirements and other commitments through 2009.
    However, KCS’ operating cash flow and financing
    alternatives can be unexpectedly impacted by various factors,
    some of which are outside of its control. For example, if KCS
    was to experience a substantial reduction in revenues or a
    substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities,
    its operating cash flows could be significantly reduced.
    Additionally, the Company is subject to economic factors
    surrounding capital markets and its ability to obtain financing
    under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions. Recent
    volatility in capital markets and the tightening of market
    liquidity could impact KCS’ access to capital. Further,
    KCS’ cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating
    agencies, which assign debt ratings based on certain credit
    measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.

As of December 31, 2008, Standard & Poor’s
    Rating Services (“S&P”) rated the senior secured
    debt as BB, the senior unsecured debt as BB-, and the preferred
    stock as CCC+. S&P also maintained a corporate rating on
    KCS of B+ and gave KCS a stable outlook. Moody’s Investor
    Service (“Moody’s”) rated the senior secured debt
    as Ba2, the senior unsecured debt of KCSR as B2, the senior
    unsecured debt of KCSM as B1, and the preferred stock as B3.
    Moody’s also maintained a corporate rating of B1 and its
    outlook remains stable.

Long
    Term Debt and Credit Facility Activity.

KCSR
    Debt.

On May 8, 2008, pursuant to an offer to purchase, KCSR
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $200.0 million of


/


% Senior
    Notes. KCSR received consents in connection with the tender
    offer and consent solicitation from holders of over 99% of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and purchased the tendered notes in accordance with the
    terms of the tender offer with proceeds received from the
    issuance of $275.0 million 8.0% of Senior Notes due
    June 1, 2015 (the “8.0% Senior Notes”).

On May 30, 2008, KCSR issued the 8.0% Senior Notes,
    which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 8.0%
    and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KCS and certain
    subsidiaries of KCS who guarantee KCSR’s credit facilities
    (the “Note Guarantors”). The 8.0% Senior Notes
    and the note guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with
    KCSR’s, KCS’, and the Note Guarantors’ existing
    and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. A portion of
    the proceeds from the issuance of the 8.0% Senior Notes was
    used to pay $200.0 million of the principal amount of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and the applicable premium and expenses associated with
    the redemption. The remaining proceeds from the issuance were
    used to reduce borrowings under the KCSR revolving credit
    facility and for general corporate purposes. The
    8.0% Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part prior
    to June 1, 2012 by paying the greater of either 101% of the
    principal amount or a “make whole” premium and in
    whole or in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed
    as percentages of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest: 2012 — 104%, 2013 — 102%,
    2014 — 100%. In addition, KCSR may redeem up to 35% of
    the notes using the proceeds of one or more equity offerings
    completed before June 1, 2011.

On December 18, 2008, KCSR issued $190.0 million of
    13.0% Senior Notes due December 15, 2013 (the
    “13.0% Senior Notes”), which bear interest
    semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 13.0% and were issued at
    a discount to par value, resulting in a $22.0 million
    discount and yield to maturity of 16.5% and are fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by KCS and the Note Guarantors. The
    13.0% Senior Notes and the note guarantees rank pari passu
    in right of payment with KCSR’s, KCS’, and the Note
    Guarantors’ existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated
    obligations. In January 2009, KCS used the net proceeds from the
    offering, along with other borrowings, to repurchase the


/


% Senior
    Notes tendered under an offer to purchase. The 13.0% Senior
    Notes are redeemable at KCSR’s option on or after
    December 15, 2011 by paying the greater of either 101% of
    the principal amount or a “make whole” premium and in
    whole or in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed
    as percentages of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest: 2011 — 113%, 2012 — 106.5%. In
    addition, KCSR may redeem up to 35% of the notes using the
    proceeds of one or more equity offerings completed before
    December 15, 2010.



On January 14, 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase, KCSR
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $200.0 million KCSR


/


% Senior
    Notes due June 15, 2009. As of January 28, 2009, (the
    consent deadline) KCSR received consents in connection with the
    tender offer and consent solicitation from holders of over 88%
    of the


/


% Senior
    Notes. On January 29, 2009, KCSR purchased the tendered
    notes in accordance with the terms of the tender offer with
    proceeds received in 2008 from the issuance of the
    13.0% Senior Notes and other borrowings.

KCSM
    Debt.

On February 26, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing
    agreement with Export Development Canada (“EDC”) for
    an aggregate amount of $72.8 million. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance 85% of the purchase price of forty new
    SD70ACe locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM in late 2007
    and early 2008. KCSM granted EDC a security interest in the
    locomotives to secure the loan. The financing agreement requires
    KCSM to make thirty equal semi-annual principal payments of
    approximately $2.4 million plus interest at an annual rate
    of 5.737%, with the final payment due and payable on
    February 28, 2023.

On September 24, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing
    agreement with DVB Bank AG (“DVB”). KCSM received the
    loan principal amount under the financing agreement of
    $52.2 million on September 26, 2008. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance approximately 80% of the purchase price of
    twenty-nine ES44AC locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM
    in June 2008. KCSM granted DVB a security interest in the
    locomotives to secure the loan. The financing agreement requires
    KCSM to make sixty equal quarterly principal payments plus
    interest at an annual rate of 6.195%, with the final payment due
    and payable on September 29, 2023.

During 2008, the consolidated cash position increased
    $174.4 million due to improved operating performance, net
    proceeds from the issuance of the 8.0% Senior Notes and the
    13.0% Senior Notes, and loan proceeds received from
    financing locomotives, which were partially offset by a higher
    level of capital expenditures and redemption of the


/


% Senior
    Notes. During 2007, the consolidated cash position decreased
    $23.5 million due to capital expenditures and the payment
    of preferred stock dividends in arrears, partially offset by
    increased operating income. Included in the 2007 capital
    expenditure amount is approximately $118.0 million for
    locomotives purchased through December 2007, of which the
    Company financed approximately $72.8 million in the first
    quarter of 2008.

KCS’ cash flow from operations has historically been
    positive and sufficient to fund operations, roadway capital
    expenditures, other capital improvements and debt service.
    External sources of cash (principally bank debt, public debt,
    preferred stock and leases) have been used to refinance existing
    indebtedness and to fund acquisitions, new investments and
    equipment additions.

Net operating cash flows for 2008 increased $74.2 million
    to $455.7 million compared to $381.5 million in 2007.
    The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
    to increased net income, distributions from unconsolidated
    affiliates and continuous improvements in the collection of
    accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in other
    working capital items resulting mainly from the timing of
    certain payments and receipts. Net operating cash flows for 2007
    increased $114.0 million to $381.5 million compared to
    $267.5 million in 2006. The increase in operating cash
    flows was primarily attributable to better operating performance
    and changes in working capital balances reflecting significant
    improvement in the collection of receivables and the timing of
    payments and other receipts.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash
    outflows were $580.7 million and $380.5 million during
    2008 and 2007, respectively. This $200.2 million increase
    was due to a higher level of capital expenditures. Net investing
    cash outflows for 2007 increased $214.5 million as compared
    to 2006, which was related to increased capital expenditures,
    decreased property sales proceeds and proceeds from loans to
    equity affiliates.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows
    were derived from the issuance of long-term debt, including
    borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, and proceeds
    from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
    Financing cash outflows were used for the repayment of debt, the
    payment of dividends on KCS’ preferred stock and the
    payment of debt costs. Financing cash flows for 2008, 2007, and
    2006 were as follows:

•

Financing cash inflows for 2008 were $299.4 million,
    resulting primarily from the issuance of debt and the financing
    of locomotives purchased, partially offset by the redemption of
    debt. During 2008, KCSR issued $275.0 million of
    8.0% Senior Notes and used a portion of the proceeds from
    the issuance to pay $200.0 million principal amount of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and the applicable premium and expenses associated with
    the redemption. Also during 2008, KCSR issued
    $190.0 million principal amount of 13.0% Senior Notes
    at a discount and used the net proceeds and other borrowings to
    repurchase a portion of the


/


% Senior
    Notes on January 29, 2009. KCSM received
    $125.0 million from financing a portion of its locomotives
    purchased in late 2007 and the first half of 2008.

•

Financing cash outflows for 2007 were $24.5 million,
    resulting primarily from the costs associated with refinancing
    debt and preferred stock dividend payments. During 2007, KCSM
    issued $165.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and used the proceeds, together with a
    $30.0 million new term loan, to redeem the KCSM


/


% Senior
    Notes and pay the associated premium and expenses. KCSR entered
    into an amendment to the 2006 Credit Agreement for a new
    $75.0 million term loan facility and used the proceeds to
    reduce amounts outstanding under KCSR’s revolving credit
    facility under the 2006



Credit Agreement. KCSM entered into a new credit agreement for a
    $30.0 million term loan facility and a revolving credit
    facility of up to $81.0 million. KCSM used the proceeds to
    repay all amounts outstanding under the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement, to refinance a portion of the


/


% Senior
    Notes, to pay costs associated with these refinancings and to
    pay the remaining amounts outstanding in respect of the
    KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes.

•

Financing cash outflows for 2006 were $53.6 million,
    resulting primarily from the repayment of short and long term
    debt, including amounts related to the KCSM acquisition, and the
    costs associated with refinancing debt. During 2006, KCSR
    entered into a new $371.1 million amended and restated
    credit agreement and used the proceeds to repay all amounts
    outstanding under the previous credit agreement. KCS also
    borrowed a net amount of $27.5 million under the Tex-Mex
    RRIF loan, repaid a net amount of $2.0 million under the
    KCSR revolving credit facility and repaid other amounts. KCSM
    issued $175.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and used the proceeds to purchase
    $146.0 million of its


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and repay $29.0 million under its term loan
    facility. KCSM also used cash on hand to repay all amounts
    outstanding under its revolving credit facility.

•

Proceeds from the sale of KCS common stock pursuant to employee
    stock plans were $8.6 million, $0.7 million, and
    $8.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

•

Payment of preferred stock cash dividends were
    $15.2 million, $23.3 million and $4.3 million in
    2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Dividends of approximately
    $0.2 million were paid each year on the 4.0% noncumulative
    preferred stock; approximately $4.2 million,
    $15.0 million and $2.1 million of dividends were paid
    in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, on the Series C
    Preferred Stock; and approximately $10.8 million,
    $8.1 million, and $2.0 million of dividends were paid
    in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, on the Series D
    Preferred Stock. All cumulative dividends in arrears were paid
    February 15, 2007.

Contractual Obligations.

The following table
    outlines the material obligations under long-term debt,
    operating leases, and other contractual commitments on
    December 31, 2008

(in millions)

. Typically, payments
    for operating leases, other contractual obligations and interest
    on long-term debt are funded through operating cash flows.
    Principal payment obligations on long-term debt are typically
    refinanced by issuing new long-term debt. If operating cash
    flows are not sufficient, funds received from other sources,
    including borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from
    property and other asset dispositions might also be available.
    These obligations are customary transactions similar to those
    entered into by others in the transportation industry. The
    Company anticipates refinancing certain parts of the long-term
    debt prior to maturity.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

The Company is party to five utilization leases covering 1,169
    railcars where car hire revenue as defined in the lease
    agreements is shared between the lessor and the Company. The
    leases expire at various times through 2015. Amounts that may be
    due to lessors under these utilization leases vary from month to
    month based on car hire rental with the minimum monthly cost to
    the Company being zero. Accordingly, the utilization leases have
    been excluded from contractual obligations above.

The SCT requires KCSM to submit a five year capital expenditures
    plan every five years. The next five year plan will be submitted
    in 2012 for the years 2013 — 2017. KCSM expects to
    continue capital spending at current levels in future years and
    will continue to have capital expenditure obligations more than
    five years from now.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements.

As further described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

KCSR holds a fifty percent interest in Southern Capital.
    Southern Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition
    and leasing of equipment including locomotives, railcars and
    other equipment. On June 25, 2002, Southern Capital
    partially refinanced the outstanding balance of certain debt
    through the issuance of 5.7% pass through trust certificates
    secured by all of the locomotives and rolling stock owned by
    Southern Capital and rental payments payable by KCSR under the
    operating leases of the equipment owned by Southern Capital. As
    Southern Capital is a fifty percent owned joint venture
    accounted for under the equity method, this debt is not
    reflected in KCS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets which are
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

KCSR holds a fifty percent interest in PCRC. PCRC, as described
    in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

was awarded a concession to reconstruct and operate the Panama
    Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad that provides international container shipping
    companies with a railway transportation option across the
    Isthmus of Panama.

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of
    $100 million of 7.0% Senior Secured Notes due November
    2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior obligations
    of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. KCSR has pledged its
    shares of PCRC as security for the Notes. The Notes are
    otherwise non-recourse to KCS. The Company has agreed, along
    with Mi-Jack Products, Inc, (“Mi-Jack”), the other 50%
    owner of PCRC, to each fund one-half of any debt service reserve
    or liquidity reserve shortfall by PCRC, (reserves which were
    established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the
    Notes). As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s portion
    of this reserve shortfall was $4.7 million. The Company has
    issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of
    $4.3 million and has made a loan of $0.4 million to
    PCRC for deposit into the debt service reserve account. The
    Company is also a guarantor for approximately $0.1 million
    of an equipment loan and has issued six irrevocable standby
    letters of credit totaling approximately $4.4 million to
    fulfill the Company’s fifty percent guarantee of additional
    equipment loans at PCRC.



Capital
    Expenditures.

KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund capital
    expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, equipment
    leases, and debt financing.

The following table summarizes cash capital expenditures by type
    for the consolidated operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively

    estimated at approximately $350 million.

Infrastructure
    and equipment expenses.

KCS, like other railroads, is required to maintain as well as
    generally self-fund all aspects of its infrastructure and
    equipment. Portions of roadway and equipment costs are
    capitalized and other portions are expensed (as components of
    materials and other and purchased services), as appropriate.
    Maintenance and capital improvement programs are in conformity
    with U.S. GAAP as well as with the standards recognized
    within the rail industry and related regulatory agencies. KCS
    expects to continue funding roadway and equipment expenditures
    from operating cash flows, equipment leases, and debt financing.

KCS has one current shelf registration statement on file with
    the SEC (the “Universal Shelf” —
    Registration

No. 333-155601).

The Universal Shelf was filed on November 21, 2008 in
    accordance with the securities offering reform rules of the SEC
    that allow “well-known seasoned issuers” to register
    an unspecified amount of different types of securities on an
    immediately effective

Form S-3

registration statement. The Universal Shelf will expire on
    November 20, 2011. On December 18, 2008, the
    Company’s subsidiary KCSR completed the sale and issuance
    of $190.0 million in aggregate principal amount
    13.0% Senior Notes due 2013 that were registered by means
    of the Universal Shelf. There remains an unspecified amount of
    securities available under the Universal Shelf.



CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’ accounting and financial reporting policies are in
    conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Management believes that the following
    accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
    understanding of KCS’ historical and future performance.
    Management has discussed the development and selection of the
    following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
    of KCS’ Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has
    reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of the
    Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates.

Capitalization
    and Depreciation of Property and Equipment.

The Company’s capitalization policy and guidelines relate
    to investments in long-lived assets (i.e., provides an economic
    benefit for more than one year). The purpose of the
    capitalization policy and guidelines is to provide guidance as
    to what costs should be capitalized (i.e., recorded to an asset
    account when the expenditure is made and charged to future
    accounting periods through depreciation or amortization
    expense). The Company’s capitalization policies and
    guidelines establish primary units of property consistent with
    what is prescribed for each asset category by the Uniform System
    of Accounts as approved by the STB, and establishes minimum
    capitalization guidelines for each asset category.

KCS capitalizes all costs necessary to make a unit of property
    ready for its intended use which includes labor, material costs,
    incremental indirect project overhead costs, and interest
    incurred during construction. Capitalized costs include
    additions, replacements and betterments of property and
    equipment. Assets are depreciated using the mass asset group
    method of accounting, consistent with generally accepted
    accounting principles, industry standards and rules established
    by the STB.

KCS also capitalizes the cost of certain work that increases the
    utility (i.e., extends the service life, increases the capacity,
    improves efficiency, etc.) of a unit of property. For example,
    rail grinding and track surfacing are the key common practices
    related to track structure in the railroad industry that extend
    the useful life of the underlying assets and significantly
    improve the stability of the rail structure as well as the
    overall safety of rail operations.

The cost of property and equipment normally retired, less
    salvage value, is charged to depreciation expense over the
    estimated average service life of the operating assets using
    depreciation rates calculated during periodic depreciation rate
    studies. The STB approves the depreciation rates used by KCSR in
    the U.S. (excluding the amortization of computer software) but
    not for the Company’s Mexico business.

These studies take into consideration the historical retirement
    experience of homogeneous assets within a certain category of
    group assets (e.g., ties, rail, box cars, covered hoppers,
    etc.), the current condition of assets, past and current
    maintenance practices, potential changes in technology and
    maintenance, estimated salvage value, and industry regulations.
    For all other consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is derived
    based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value
    using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
    of the assets.

Depreciation for property and equipment is based upon estimates
    of the useful average service lives of assets as well as their
    net salvage value at the end of their useful average service
    lives. Estimation of the useful average service lives of assets
    that are long-lived as well as their salvage value requires
    significant management judgment. Accordingly, management
    believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation
    expense are critical.

In addition to the adjustment to rates as a result of the
    depreciation studies, certain other events could occur that
    would materially affect the Company’s estimates and
    assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in
    operations or technology could substantially alter
    management’s assumptions regarding KCS’ ability to
    realize the return of its investment in operating assets and,
    therefore, affect the amount of depreciation expense in both
    current and future periods.



Because depreciation expense is a function of statistical
    studies made of property, plant and equipment, subsequent
    studies could result in different estimates of useful lives and
    net salvage values. If future depreciation studies yield results
    indicating that the assets have shorter lives as a result of
    obsolescence, physical condition, changes in technology or
    changes in net salvage values, the estimate of depreciation
    expense could increase. Likewise, if future studies indicate
    that assets have longer average service lives, the estimate of
    depreciation expense could decrease.

Depreciation Rate Studies.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, KCSR engaged a civil engineering
    firm to assist management in evaluating depreciation rates for
    property and equipment. The study centered on evaluating
    historical replacement patterns to assess future lives and
    indicated that KCSR was depreciating its property on average
    over shorter periods than the assets were actually used. The
    effect of this change in estimate was recorded prospectively in
    depreciation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
    KCSM adopted the mass asset group depreciation method consistent
    with KCSR. In order to assist management with the change to the
    group method, KCSM engaged a civil engineering firm to conduct a
    study of depreciation rates for property and equipment. The
    study centered on evaluating historical replacement patterns to
    assess future lives and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its
    property over shorter periods than the assets were actually
    used. As a result, changes to depreciation were adjusted
    prospectively through depreciation expense. Unlike KCSR, KCSM
    depreciation rates are not subject to the approval of the STB
    and the changes to the depreciation rates, as a result of the
    study, were applied in 2005. Concession rights and related
    assets and improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
    determined concession life or the useful lives as determined by
    the KCSM depreciation study.

Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was $170.1 million. A 1% change in
    the average life of all group assets would result in a
    $1.1 million change to the Company’s depreciation
    expense.

Incremental Indirect Project Overhead
    Costs.

Incremental indirect project costs related
    to the construction of capital assets are captured and allocated
    to projects through overhead rates. KCS uses a full absorption
    costing methodology that is in line with SFAS 67,
    “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real
    Estate Projects,” to calculate overhead rates to capture
    indirect incremental project costs. These incremental costs are
    variable such that if there was a reduction in capital, there
    would generally be a reduction in these costs (e.g., fewer
    capital projects would generally result in fewer number of
    employees as well as other related incremental costs). Annually,
    KCS performs a study of the self construction process and all
    supporting activities to update its overhead rates.

Capitalized Interest.

In accordance with
    SFAS No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest
    Costs,” KCS capitalizes interest incurred in connection
    with the construction of capital projects that provide increased
    capacity to its rail infrastructure.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

FASB
    Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional
    Asset Retirement Obligations,” was issued in 2005, which
    interpreted the application of SFAS No. 143,
    “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which
    requires the recognition of a liability for legal obligations to
    perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and
    (or) method of the settlement are conditional on a future event.
    KCS has recognized asset retirement obligations for contractual
    obligations related to leased rail cars,



fuel storage tanks, and the tie treatment facility. The Company
    evaluates changes in laws and contractual obligations that may
    arise to determine any impact on potential future obligations.
    As of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded
    liabilities of $4.2 million related to asset retirement
    obligations.

Provision
    for Environmental Remediation.

As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

the Company’s operations are subject to extensive federal,
    state and local environmental laws and regulations in the
    U.S. and Mexico. KCS conducts studies, as well as site
    surveys, to determine the extent of environmental remediation
    necessary to clean up a site. These studies incorporate the
    analysis of internal and external environmental engineering
    staff and consultation with internal and external legal counsel.
    From these studies and surveys, a range of estimates of the
    costs involved is derived. These cost estimates are based on
    forecasts of the total future direct costs related to
    environmental remediation and change periodically as additional
    or better information becomes available as to the extent of site
    remediation required, if any. KCS accrues for the cost of
    remediation where the obligation is probable and such costs can
    be reasonably estimated.

Cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies
    related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
    and anticipated cost. Certain changes could occur that would
    materially affect management’s estimates and assumptions
    related to costs for environmental remediation. If KCS becomes
    subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at
    known sites, discovers additional contamination, discovers
    previously unknown sites, or becomes subject to related personal
    or property damage, KCS could incur additional costs that could
    be significant in connection with its environmental remediation.
    Accordingly, management believes that estimates related to the
    accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to
    KCS’ results of operations.

Environmental remediation expense was $6.1 million and
    $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    and 2007, respectively and was included in casualties and
    insurance expense on the consolidated statements of income.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2008, KCS had a liability
    for environmental remediation of $6.4 million. KCS’
    environmental liabilities are not discounted. This amount was
    derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5
    “Accounting for Contingencies”
    (“SFAS 5”). For purposes of earnings sensitivity
    analysis, if the December 31, 2008 environmental reserve
    was adjusted (increased or decreased) by 10%, environmental
    expense would change by $0.6 million.

Provision
    for Casualty Claims.

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
    personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
    crossing collisions and derailments, as well as claims related
    to personal property damage and other casualties is a
    substantial expense to KCS. Claims are estimated and recorded
    for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not
    reported (“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent with general
    practices within the railroad industry, the estimated liability
    for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined on an
    undiscounted basis. In estimating the liability for casualty
    claims, KCS bases the estimate on an updated study of casualty
    reserves, which calculates an estimate using historical
    experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous
    assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an
    estimate of future claim costs.

Personal injury and other casualty claims are subject to a
    significant degree of uncertainty, especially estimates related
    to incurred but not reported personal injuries for which a party
    has yet to assert a claim. In deriving an estimate of the
    provision for casualty claims, management must make assumptions
    related to substantially uncertain matters (injury severity,
    claimant age and legal jurisdiction). Changes in the assumptions
    used for actuarial studies could have a material effect on the
    estimate of the provision for casualty claims. The most
    sensitive assumptions for personal injury accruals are the
    expected average cost per claim and the projected frequency
    rates for the number of claims that will ultimately result in
    payment. Management believes that the accounting estimate
    related to the liability for personal injuries and other
    casualty claims is



critical to KCS’ results of operations. See also
    Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Based on the methods described above and information available
    as of December 31, 2008, the liability for personal injury
    casualty claims was $90.7 million. A 5% increase or
    decrease in either the expected average cost per claim or the
    frequency rate for claims with payments would result in an
    approximate $4.5 million increase or decrease in the
    Company’s recorded personal injury reserves.

For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, casualty
    expense equaled $55.8 million and $55.0 million,
    respectively, and was included in casualties and insurance
    expense in the consolidated statements of income.

Provision
    for Income Taxes.

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of the
    Company. For financial reporting purposes, management determines
    the current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of
    accounting for income taxes as specified in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” The provision for income taxes is the sum of
    income taxes both currently payable and deferred into the
    future. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability
    related to the Company’s U.S., state and Mexican income tax
    returns for the current year and anticipated tax payments
    resulting from income tax audits while the net deferred tax
    expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of
    deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance
    sheet. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based upon the changes in differences between the
    basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
    and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as
    measured using the enacted tax rates that management estimates
    will be in effect when these differences reverse. The tax
    provision for Mexico has additional complications such as the
    impacts of inflation as well as the exchange rate, both of which
    can have a significant impact on the calculation. In addition to
    estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of
    tax differences, management must also make certain assumptions
    regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary. If
    the differences are temporary, management must estimate the
    timing of their reversal, and whether taxable operating income
    in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any
    gross deferred tax assets of the Company. Accordingly,
    management believes that the estimates related to the provision
    for income taxes are critical to the Company’s results of
    operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, income tax expense
    totaled $64.5 million. For every 1% change in the 2008
    effective rate, income tax expense would have changed by
    $2.5 million. For an increase of 1% in the Mexican
    inflation rate the tax expense would decrease by approximately
    $3.1 million. If the exchange rate used at the end of 2008
    increased by $0.10 from $13.5 Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar
    to $13.6 pesos per dollar, the tax expense would have
    decreased by approximately $1.5 million.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are
    of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
    Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
    current and former employees for job related injuries and by
    third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS
    aggressively defends these matters and has established liability
    reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected
    costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any
    legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s
    management, other than those proceedings described in
    Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition.

Inflation.

U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles require the use of historical cost, which
    does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement
    cost of property. Due to the capital intensive nature of
    KCS’ business, the replacement cost of these assets would
    be significantly larger than the amounts reported under the
    historical cost basis.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Refer to
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

for information relative to recent accounting pronouncements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures Concerning Market

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
    inherent market risks, but these instruments have not been
    entered into for trading purposes. The following information,
    together with information included in Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 13 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that
    have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Floating-rate
    indebtedness totaled $443.9 million and $487.1 million
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Two credit
    agreements, each comprised of a revolving credit facility and
    term loan facilities, contain variable rate debt which accrues
    interest based on target interest indexes (London Interbank
    Offered Rate — “LIBOR” or an alternative
    base rate) plus an applicable spread, as set forth in each
    credit agreement. The Company has an aggregate notional amount
    of $250.0 million of interest rate hedges at
    December 31, 2008, which effectively convert interest
    payments from variable rates to fixed rates. Given the balance
    of $193.9 million at December 31, 2008 of variable
    rate debt net of interest rate hedges, KCS is sensitive to
    fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical
    100 basis points increase in each of the respective target
    interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of
    $1.9 million on an annualized basis for the net
    floating-rate instruments issued by the Company as of
    December 31, 2008.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of debt was approximately
    $1,911.5 million and $1,771.8 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared with a
    carrying value of $2,086.1 million and
    $1,755.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Commodity Price Sensitivity.

As described in
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Other
    Matters — Derivative Instruments” of this

Form 10-K,

KCS periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment
    and swap transactions. At December 31, 2008, KCS did not
    have any outstanding fuel swap agreements. The Company also
    holds fuel inventories for use in operations. These inventories
    are not material to KCS’ overall financial position. Fuel
    costs are expected to mirror market conditions in 2009, however,
    fuel cost are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors
    outside the Company’s control. KCS also cushions the impact
    of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from
    customers. Assuming annual consumption of 130 million
    gallons, a 10 cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would
    cause a $13.0 million change in operating expenses.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity.

KCSM uses the
    dollar as its functional currency. Earnings from KCSM included
    in the Company’s results of operations reflect revaluation
    gains and losses that KCSM records in the process of translating
    certain transactions from pesos to dollars. Therefore, the
    Company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso.
    KCSM evaluates the use of foreign currency instruments to hedge
    KCS’ dollar investment in KCSM as market conditions and
    exchange rates fluctuate. For example, a hypothetical 10%
    increase in the U.S. dollar to the Mexican peso exchange
    rate on net peso denominated monetary assets of Ps.728.1 million
    would result in a translation loss of approximately
    $4.9 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would
    result in a translation gain of approximately $6.0 million.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

KCS’ internal control over financial reporting was designed
    to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the framework established by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

(commonly referred to as the COSO framework).
    Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria
    outlined in the COSO framework.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm, as stated in their attestation report, which immediately
    follows this report.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited Kansas City Southern’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Kansas City Southern maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Kansas City Southern as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our
    report dated February 13, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Kansas City Southern’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 13, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

As discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes

, effective January 1, 2007.

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.  Description
    of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
    “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was initially
    organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. In
    2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas City
    Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal operations in
    rail transportation.

The Company is engaged primarily in the freight rail
    transportation business operating through a single coordinated
    rail network under one reportable business segment. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company realigned its segments into
    one reportable segment to reflect the strategic focus on the
    single coordinated network. Prior to January 1, 2008, the
    Company reported two segments. All prior period segment
    information has been recast to conform to the current year
    presentation.

The Company generates revenues and cash flows by providing its
    customers with freight delivery services both within its
    regions, and throughout North America through connections with
    other Class I rail carriers. KCS’ customers conduct
    business in a number of different industries, including
    electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum products,
    paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral products,
    automotive products and intermodal transportation.

The primary subsidiaries of the Company consist of the following:

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a
    wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary;

•

Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”), a wholly-owned consolidated
    subsidiary; which wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”);

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy-three
    percent owned consolidated affiliate. On December 1, 2005,
    KCS and KCSR entered into a transaction agreement with Norfolk
    Southern Corporation (“NS”) and its wholly-owned
    subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company
    (“AGS”), providing for the formation of a limited
    liability company between the parties relating to the ownership
    and improvement of the KCSR rail line between Meridian,
    Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of
    the KCSR rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as
    the “Meridian Speedway”;

•

Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“KCSM”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary which operates
    under the rights granted by the Concession acquired from the
    Mexican government in 1997 (the “Concession”) as
    described below;

•

Arrendadora KCSM, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Arrendadora”),
    a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, with KCSM holding
    ninety-eight percent ownership and KCSM Holdings LLC, a 100%
    owned KCSM subsidiary, owning the remaining two percent. It is
    responsible for leasing to KCSM the locomotives and freight cars
    acquired through the privatization of KCSM and subsequently sold
    to Arrendadora by KCSM.

Combined with equity investments in:

•

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), a fifty percent
    owned unconsolidated affiliate which owns all of the common
    stock of Panarail Tourism Company (“Panarail”);

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that owns and leases locomotives and other equipment.

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

KCS completed its acquisition of control of Grupo KCSM, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as Grupo
    Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or Grupo
    TFM on April 1, 2005, and Grupo KCSM became a consolidated
    subsidiary of KCS. On September 12, 2005, the Company and
    its subsidiaries, Grupo KCSM and KCSM, the Mexican holding
    company Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”), entered into a
    settlement agreement with the Mexican government resolving the
    controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
    government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
    the purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM owned by the
    Mexican government (the “Vat/Put Settlement”). As a
    result of this settlement, KCS wholly owns Grupo KCSM and KCSM.
    Grupo KCSM was merged with KCSM effective May 8, 2007.

The KCSM Concession.

KCSM holds a Concession
    from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusive through
    2027, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to
    other concessionaires) which is renewable under certain
    conditions for additional periods of up to 50 years. The
    Concession is to provide freight transportation services over
    rail lines which are a primary commercial corridor of the
    Mexican railroad system. These lines include the shortest, most
    direct rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas and
    serve most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and
    three of its major shipping ports. KCSM has the right to use,
    but does not own, all track and buildings that are necessary for
    the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is obligated to maintain
    the right of way, track structure, buildings and related
    maintenance facilities to the operational standards specified in
    the concession agreement and to return the assets in that
    condition at the end of the Concession period. KCSM is required
    to pay the Mexican government a concession duty equal to 0.5% of
    gross revenues during the first 15 years of the Concession
    period and 1.25% of such revenues during the remainder of the
    period.

Under the Concession and Mexican law, the Company may freely set
    rates unless the Mexican government determines that there is no
    effective competition in Mexico’s rail industry. KCSM is
    required to register its rates with the Mexican government and
    to provide railroad services to all users on a fair and
    non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and
    safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican
    government. In the event that rates charged are higher than the
    registered rates, KCSM must reimburse customers with interest,
    and risk the revocation of the Concession.

Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations and the Concession
    establish several circumstances under which the Concession will
    terminate: revocation by the Mexican government, statutory
    appropriation, or KCSM’s voluntary surrender of its rights
    or liquidation or bankruptcy. The Concession requires the
    undertaking of capital projects, including those described in a
    business plan filed every five years with the Mexican
    government. KCSM filed its third business plan with the Mexican
    government in December 2007 in which KCSM committed to certain
    minimal investment and capital improvement goals, which may be
    waived by the Mexican government upon application for relief for
    good cause. Mexico may also revoke KCSM’s exclusivity after
    2017 if it determines that there is insufficient competition.

The Concession is subject to early termination or revocation
    under certain circumstances. In the event that the Concession is
    revoked by the Mexican government, KCSM will receive no
    compensation. Rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the
    Concession, as well as all improvements made by KCSM or third
    parties, will revert to the Mexican government. All other
    property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause KCSM to lease all service-related assets to it for a
    term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will have a right of first refusal with respect to
    certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after any revocation of the Concession. The Mexican
    government may also temporarily seize the rail lines and assets
    used in operating the rail lines in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbances, or imminent
    danger to the domestic peace or economy for the duration of any
    of the foregoing events; provided,



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

however, that Mexican law requires that the Mexican government
    pay KCSM compensation equal to damages caused and losses
    suffered if it effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of
    the public interest. These payments may not be sufficient to
    compensate the Company for its losses and may not be timely made.

Employees and Labor Relations.

Labor relations
    in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the Railway Labor Act’s
    procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and
    the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted.
    Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take
    place over an extended period of time and the Company rarely
    experiences work stoppages during negotiations. Wages, health
    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have
    traditionally been addressed during these negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carrier’s Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees had been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated on November 1, 2004, which
    concluded in the fourth quarter of 2008. Long term settlement
    agreements were reached during 2007 and 2008 covering all of of
    KCSR’s unionized work force through January 1, 2010.
    There were no settlements that had a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997, between KCSM and the Sindicato
    de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana
    (Mexican Railroad Union), for a term of 50 years, for the
    purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties and
    improving conditions for the union employees. Approximately 80%
    of KCSM employees are covered by this labor agreement. The
    compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to
    renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms are subject
    to negotiation every two years. Compensation terms and other
    benefits have been renegotiated and KCSM finalized these terms
    with the union during the fourth quarter of 2008 with the
    exception of the KCSM retirement benefit which is still under
    negotiations. The union labor negotiation with the Mexican
    Railroad Union has not historically resulted in any strike,
    boycott, or other disruption in KCSM’s business operations
    and there were no settlements that had a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements are presented using the
    accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
    majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
    year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
    which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
    influence, but not a controlling interest. The Company evaluates
    less than majority owned investments for consolidation pursuant
    to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003). The Company
    does not have any less than majority owned investments requiring
    consolidation.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
    of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business
    combination. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the goodwill
    balance was $10.6 million which is included in other assets
    in the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
    goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
    not amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for
    impairment. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent
    that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ fair value.
    Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The
    Company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill as
    of September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and concluded
    there were no impairments. SFAS 142 requires testing for
    impairment between annual tests if an event or circumstances
    change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of
    a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Due to the decline
    in the Company’s stock price in the current global economic
    environment, the Company performed an updated formal impairment
    review as of December 31, 2008 and concluded that the fair
    value exceeded the carrying amount and therefore there was no
    impairment to goodwill.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial
    reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include those related to the recoverability and
    useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation,
    environmental remediation, casualty claims, and the valuation of
    share-based compensation and deferred tax assets. Changes in
    facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Currency Translation.

For tax purposes, KCSM
    and its subsidiaries are required to maintain their books and
    records in Mexican pesos. For financial reporting purposes, KCSM
    and its subsidiaries maintain records in U.S. dollars,
    which is the functional currency. The dollar is the currency
    that reflects the economic substance of the underlying events
    and circumstances relevant to the entity (i.e., historical cost
    convention). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    pesos are translated into dollars using current exchange rates.
    The difference between the exchange rate on the date of the
    transaction and the exchange rate on the settlement date, or
    balance sheet date if not settled, is included in the income
    statement as foreign exchange gain or loss.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    freight revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a
    commodity movement as a shipment moves from origin to
    destination, with the related expense recognized as incurred.
    Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the product is
    shipped, as services are performed or contractual obligations
    fulfilled.

Cash Equivalents.

Short term liquid
    investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
    when purchased are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable
    are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined
    by historical experience and adjusted for economic uncertainties
    or known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance when a
    customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has been transferred
    to a collection agent or submitted for legal action, or when a
    customer is significantly past due and all available means of
    collection have been exhausted. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $8.7 million
    and $9.7 million, respectively. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, accounts receivable allowance
    recovery was $0.5 million and $2.3 million,
    respectively.

Restricted Funds.

Restricted funds primarily
    represent contributions received from NS for MSLLC which are
    restricted for use by KCS. These funds are restricted until they
    are used by MSLLC for capital improvements on the Meridian
    Speedway.

Materials and Supplies.

Materials and supplies
    consisting of diesel fuel, items to be used in the maintenance
    of rolling stock and items to be used in the maintenance or
    construction of road property are valued at the lower of average
    cost or market.

Derivative Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended,
    requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet as
    either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives are recorded



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

either through current earnings or as other comprehensive
    income, depending on hedge designation. Gains and losses on
    derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are
    reported in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into
    earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the
    variability of the cash flow of the hedged item. The ineffective
    portion of all hedge transactions is recognized in current
    period earnings.

Concession Rights and Related Assets.

Costs
    incurred by the Company to acquire the Concession rights and
    related assets were capitalized and are amortized over the
    lesser of the Concession agreement term or the estimated useful
    lives of the related assets and rights acquired.

Property and Depreciation.

Property is stated
    at cost less accumulated depreciation. KCS capitalizes costs
    relating to additions and replacements of property and equipment
    including interest on major capacity projects during their
    construction, and certain incremental indirect overhead costs
    related to construction and improvement projects using the full
    absorption costing method. Depreciation for property and
    equipment is derived using the mass asset group method. Under
    the group method, numerous homogeneous assets (units) are
    grouped into a single depreciable category and the category is
    depreciated over the average service life of the aggregate
    units. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as
    incurred.

The cost of track structure, other roadway property, and
    equipment normally retired, less salvage value, is charged to
    accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The
    cost of property abnormally retired, together with accumulated
    depreciation thereon, is eliminated from the property accounts
    and the related gains or losses are reflected in net income.

KCS continuously evaluates the use of it’s investment in
    land. As a result, KCS frequently buys and sells land to support
    its strategic objectives. Land is a non-depreciable asset, and
    the Company’s practice is to record any gains or losses on
    land sales below operating income through other income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

The Company
    reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
    may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and
    if the carrying amount of an asset is evaluated and found not to
    be recoverable (carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash
    flows from use and disposition), then an impairment loss must be
    recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of the
    carrying amount over the asset (or asset group’s) fair
    value. Due to the current global economic environment, the
    Company tested its long lived assets for impairment as of
    December 31, 2008 and no impairments were identified.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157 “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) for financial
    assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis.
    SFAS 157 defines the fair value as the exchange price that
    would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability
    (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for
    the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. The Company determines the
    fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value
    hierarchy established in SFAS 157 which requires an entity
    to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy is
    broken down into three levels based upon the observability of
    inputs. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize
    quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
    assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
    access. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than
    quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability, and include situations where there is little, if any,
    market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases,
    the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
    levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in
    the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement
    in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
    its entirety. The



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular
    input to the fair value in its entirety requires judgment and
    considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107
    “Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments” requires the disclosure of the estimated fair
    value of financial instruments. The Company’s short term
    financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying value of
    the short term financial instruments approximates the fair value
    due to their short term nature. These financial instruments have
    no stated maturities or the financial instruments have short
    term maturities that approximate market.

The fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated using
    quoted market prices when available. When quoted market prices
    are not available, fair value is estimated based on current
    market interest rates for debt with similar maturities. The fair
    value of the Company’s debt was $1,911.5 million and
    $1,771.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The financial statement carrying value was
    $2,086.1 million and $1,775.9 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company records
    liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to
    past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future
    expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to
    their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation
    costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
    receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance
    activities related to current operations are expensed as
    incurred.

Casualty Claims.

Casualty claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
    amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
    The Company’s casualty liability reserve is based on
    actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted basis. The
    reserve is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims
    incurred but not yet reported. While the ultimate amount of
    claims incurred is dependent on various factors, it is
    management’s opinion that the recorded liability is a
    reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims. Adjustments to
    the liability will be reflected as operating expenses in the
    period in which the adjustments are known. Legal fees related to
    casualty claims are recorded in operating expense in the period
    incurred.

KCSM Union Retirement Benefit and Other Postretirement
    Benefits.

The Company provides certain medical,
    life and other postretirement benefits to certain active
    employees and retirees. The Company uses actuaries to assist
    management in estimating liabilities and expenses for KCSM union
    retirement benefits and other post retirement benefits.
    Estimated amounts are based on current and historical
    information, current information and estimates regarding future
    events and circumstances. Significant assumptions used in the
    valuation of union retirement benefit and other postretirement
    liabilities include the discount rate, rate of increase in
    compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate.

KCSM Employees’ Statutory Profit
    Sharing.

KCSM is subject to employee statutory
    profit sharing requirements under Mexican law and calculates
    profit sharing liability as 10% of KCSM net taxable income,
    adjusted as prescribed by the Mexican income tax law. Deferred
    employees’ statutory profit sharing is accounted for in a
    manner similar to income taxes under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes”.

Share-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts
    for all share-based compensation in accordance with the fair
    value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123R (Revised) “Share-Based
    Payments” (“SFAS 123R”). Under this method,
    compensation expense is measured at grant date based on the then
    fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite
    service period in which the award is earned. The Company elected
    to adopt SFAS 123R on a modified prospective basis
    requiring that all new awards and modified awards after the
    effective date and any unvested awards at the effective date be
    recognized as compensation cost ratably over the option vesting
    period. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at
    the time of the grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods should actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company issues treasury stock to settle share-based awards.
    The Company does not intend to repurchase any shares in 2009 to
    provide shares to issue as share-based awards; however,
    management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the
    level of shares outstanding.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of
    transactions reported in different periods for financial
    reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method
    gives consideration to the future tax consequences of the
    deferred income tax items and immediately recognizes changes in
    income tax laws upon enactment. In addition, the Company has not
    provided U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed
    operating earnings of its foreign investments since the earnings
    will be invested indefinitely or the earnings will be remitted
    in a tax-free transaction.

The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset, net of a
    valuation allowance for net operating loss carryovers. The
    Company projects sufficient future taxable income to realize the
    deferred tax asset recorded less the valuation allowance. These
    projections take into consideration assumptions about inflation
    rates, currency fluctuations, future income and future capital
    expenditures. If assumptions or actual conditions change, the
    deferred tax asset, net of the valuation allowance, will be
    adjusted to properly reflect the expected tax benefit.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per common
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
    the potential dilution that could occur if convertible
    securities were converted into common stock or stock based
    awards were exercised or earned. The following table reconciles
    the weighted average shares used for the basic earnings per
    share computation to the shares used for the diluted earnings
    per share computation at December 31

    Accounting Pronouncements.

SFAS 157.

In September 2006, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”)
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”),
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements. Effective
    January 1, 2008, KCS adopted SFAS 157 prospectively
    for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on
    a recurring basis. For more information on the fair value of the
    Company’s financial assets and liabilities, see
    Note 6 — “Fair Value Measurements”. In
    February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

SFAS No. 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(“FSP 157-2”)

which delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). These
    nonfinancial items include assets and liabilities such as
    reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment
    test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    a business combination. The Company will adopt SFAS 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities beginning
    January 1, 2009. The Company does not anticipate that the
    adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities will have a material impact on its
    results of operations and financial condition.

SFAS 160.

In December of 2007, the FASB
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160
    requires all entities to report noncontrolling interests,
    previously referred to as minority interests, as a separate
    component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of
    permanent equity and applies to the accounting for
    noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling
    interest holders in consolidated financial statements.
    SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively to all
    noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the
    effective date except that comparative period information must
    be recast to classify noncontrolling interests in equity,
    attribute net income and other comprehensive income to
    noncontrolling interests, and provide other disclosures required
    by SFAS 160. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company
    beginning on January 1, 2009. The Company does not
    anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a
    material impact on its results of operations.

SFAS 161.

In March 2008, the FASB issued
    Statement No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities — an amendment to
    SFAS No. 133 (“SFAS No. 161”).
    SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of
    SFAS 133 to clarify how and why companies use derivative
    instruments. In addition, FAS 161 requires more disclosures
    regarding how companies account for derivative instruments and
    the impact derivatives have on a company’s financial
    statements. This statement is effective



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

for the Company beginning on January 1, 2009. The adoption
    of SFAS 161 will not impact the Company’s results of
    operations and financial condition.

Panama
    Canal Railway Company.

PCRC, a joint venture company owned equally by KCS and Mi-Jack
    Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession
    from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the
    Panama Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international container shipping companies with a railway
    transportation option in lieu of the Panama Canal. The
    concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of
    25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional
    25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south
    railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic
    and Pacific Oceans. PCRC’s Panarail subsidiary operates and
    promotes commuter and tourist passenger service over the Panama
    Canal Railway.

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of
    $100.0 million of 7.0% Senior Secured Notes due
    November 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior
    obligations of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. In
    addition, the Company has pledged its shares of PCRC as security
    for the Notes. The Notes are otherwise non-recourse to the
    Company. The Company has agreed, along with Mi-Jack to each fund
    one-half of any debt service reserve or liquidity reserve
    shortfall by PCRC, (reserves which were established by PCRC in
    connection with the issuance of the Notes). As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s portion of this
    reserve shortfall was $4.7 million. The Company has issued
    a standby letter of credit in the amount of $4.3 million
    and has made a loan to PCRC of $0.4 million for deposit
    into the debt service reserve account.

A portion of the proceeds of the Notes was used by PCRC to repay
    the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the senior
    debt held by the International Finance Corporation
    (“IFC”), which was formerly guaranteed by the partners
    of PCRC. The repayment resulted in the release of the
    Company’s $13.4 million of guaranties of this debt. In
    addition, the Company received cash payments from PCRC totaling
    $26.3 million to repay the principal and accrued interest
    of the subordinated loans and advances made to PCRC by the
    Company. The remainder of the proceeds was used to repay
    principal and accrued interest on subordinated loans and
    advances made to PCRC by Mi-Jack, to fund a portion of the debt
    service reserve account, to fund a capital expenditure account,
    and to pay fees and expenses associated with the offering.

The Company is also a guarantor for approximately
    $0.1 million of an equipment loan and has issued six
    irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling approximately
    $4.4 million to fulfill the Company’s fifty percent
    guarantee of additional equipment loans at PCRC.

In December 2007, KCSM and PCRC entered into a loan agreement
    (the “Loan”), pursuant to which KCSM loaned PCRC
    $4.2 million. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    $3.4 million and $3.8 million is

    City Southern

    Statements — (Continued)

included in investments and $0.5 million and
    $0.4 million is included in other current assets,
    respectively. The term of the Loan is eight years and bears
    interest at a rate per annum equal to four hundred basis points
    over the British Bankers Association

90-day

LIBOR
    Rate applicable for the quarter. PCRC will pay the principal
    amount in thirty-two equal quarterly payments together with any
    and all corresponding interest, on the last day of March, June,
    September, and December of each year, with the payments ending
    in 2015. The parties agreed that the maturity of the Loan may be
    extended with the prior written agreement of the parties.

In December 2007, KCSM and PCRC entered into a locomotive
    purchase agreement, pursuant to which KCSM agreed to sell PCRC
    five used SD60 locomotives for $4.2 million. PCRC made an
    advance payment of $4.2 million in December 2007. All of
    the locomotives were delivered to PCRC by March 2008.

In 2008, the Company received cash dividends of
    $8.0 million from PCRC. In 2007 and 2006, PCRC did not
    declare nor pay dividends.

Southern
    Capital.

In 1996, the Company and GATX Capital Corporation
    (“GATX”) completed a transaction for the formation and
    financing of a joint venture, Southern Capital. Southern
    Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition of
    locomotives, rolling stock and other equipment and the leasing
    thereof. The Company holds a fifty percent interest in Southern
    Capital, which it accounts for using the equity method of
    accounting.

KCSR paid Southern Capital $23.0 million,
    $18.6 million, and $26.5 million in 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively, under operating leases. In connection with
    the formation of Southern Capital, the Company received cash
    that exceeded the net book value of assets contributed to the
    joint venture by about $44 million. Accordingly, the excess
    fair value over book value is being recognized as a reduction in
    certain lease rental expenses over the terms of such leases
    equal to $0.5 million, $0.2 million, and
    $2.7 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. In
    2007, Southern Capital paid a dividend in the form of
    locomotives. The Company received 42 locomotives at a fair value
    of $10.3 million. In 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company
    received cash dividends of $3.8 million, $4.0 million,
    and $4.5 million, respectively, from Southern Capital.

In 2007, Southern Capital recorded a gain of $11.3 million
    related to a locomotive capital dividend. No such gains were
    recorded in 2008 or 2006. For purposes of recording its share of
    Southern Capital earnings, the Company has recorded its share of
    the gain as a reduction to the cost basis of the equipment
    acquired. As a result, the Company will recognize its equity in
    the gain over the remaining depreciable life of the locomotives
    as a reduction of depreciation expense.

Ferrocarril
    y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico Valley
    Railway and Terminal or “FTVM”).

FTVM provides railroad services as well as ancillary services,
    including those related to interconnection, switching and
    haulage services in the greater Mexico City area. KCSM holds 25%
    of the share capital of FTVM. The other shareholders of FTVM,
    each holding a 25% interest, are Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferromex”), Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferrosur”) and the Mexican government.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
    use portions of its track to Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM, and
    these companies are required to grant KCSM the rights to use
    portions of their tracks.

In 2008, the Company received cash dividends of
    $7.2 million from FTVM. In 2007 and 2006, FTVM did not
    declare nor pay dividends.

Other
    Investments

During 2007, the Company invested in a financial institution
    cash management fund for which withdrawals have been restricted
    by the fund manager based on the changing liquidity of the
    underlying investments and to maintain the net book value and
    minimize potential losses to all of its investors. As a result,
    the Company has the ability and intent to hold the underlying
    securities of the fund until maturity. As of December 31,
    2008, the fair value of the investment is $12.4 million
    which was included in investments on the consolidated balance
    sheet. The Company performed an assessment and recorded an
    impairment allowance related to the investment of
    $0.8 million based on various factors including the credit
    status of each issuer for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The Company has received par value for all maturities of the
    underlying investments that have matured to date. As of
    December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the investment was
    $37.8 million of which $11.5 million was included in
    restricted funds and $26.3 million was included in
    investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Scheduled
    maturities of the remaining investments, net of allowances at
    December 31, 2008, are as follows: $10.8 million
    mature in one year, $0.1 million mature between one year
    and five years, $0.7 million mature between five years and
    ten years, and $0.8 million mature after ten years.

The Company owns 16.6% of the Kansas City Terminal Railway
    Company, which owns and operates 80 miles of track and
    operates an additional eight miles of track under trackage
    rights in greater Kansas City, Missouri. This investment is
    accounted for under the cost method of accounting and had a
    balance of $3.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Acquisitions

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141 “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141”), the Company allocates the purchase
    price of its acquisitions to the tangible and intangible assets
    and liabilities of the acquired entity based on their fair
    values. The excess of the purchase price over the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

fair value is recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to
    acquired assets and incurred liabilities are based on valuations
    prepared by independent third party appraisal firms, published
    market prices and management estimates.

Acquisition
    of Controlling Interest in Grupo KCSM.

April 1, 2005 — Acquisition
    Agreement.

In furtherance of the Company’s
    strategy for expansion into Mexico, on December 15, 2004,
    the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Acquisition
    Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with Grupo
    TMM, S.A.B. (“TMM”, formerly Grupo TMM, S.A.), and
    other parties under which KCS acquired full control of KCSM
    through the purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo KCSM. At
    the time, Grupo KCSM held an 80% interest in KCSM and all of the
    shares of stock with full voting rights of KCSM. The remaining
    20% economic interest in KCSM was owned by the Mexican
    government in the form of shares with limited voting rights.

On September 12, 2005, KCS and its subsidiaries, KCSM and
    Grupo KCSM, along with TMM, entered into a settlement agreement
    with the Mexican government, resolving controversies and
    disputes between the companies and the Mexican government
    concerning the VAT Claim and Put. In accordance with the
    Acquisition Agreement under which KCS acquired its controlling
    interest in KCSM, a payment of additional purchase price of
    $99.5 million became payable to TMM as a result of the
    final resolution of the VAT Claim and Put. This amount was paid
    by KCS and recorded as an increase in the equity of KCSM.

The VAT/Put Settlement had two separate impacts —
    first, the resolution of a pre-acquisition contingency related
    to the April 1, 2005 transaction and second, KCSM’s
    acquisition of the minority interest held by the Mexican
    government.

Settlement
    Agreement with TMM

On September 24, 2007, KCS entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the “Agreement”) with TMM,
    TMM Logistics, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of TMM, and VEX
    Asesores Corporativos, S.A. de C.V. (formerly José F.
    Serrano International Business, S.A. de C.V.) (the
    “Consulting Firm”), resolving certain claims and
    disputes over liabilities established as part of KCS’
    acquisition of KCSM (successor by merger to Grupo KCSM).
    Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, KCS agreed to pay TMM
    $54.1 million in cash to retire two notes totaling
    $86.6 million which were negotiated in 2005 at the closing
    of KCS’ acquisition of KCSM to cover certain post-closing
    contingencies and tax liabilities. The parties also agreed to
    terminate the consulting agreement between KCS and the
    Consulting Firm and make the final annual payment of
    $3.0 million, payable on settlement. The settlement amount
    of $57.1 million was paid by KCS to TMM on October 1,
    2007.

Investments with Level 1 and/or Level 2 inputs are
    classified as a Level 3 investment in their entirety if it
    has at least one significant Level 3 input.

The Company determines the fair values of its derivative
    financial instrument positions based upon pricing models using
    inputs observed from actively quoted markets. Pricing models
    take into consideration the contract terms as well as other
    inputs, including forward interest rate curves. As prescribed by
    SFAS 157, the Company recognizes the fair value of its
    derivative financial instruments as a Level 2 valuation.

The Company determines the fair value of its investment in a
    financial institution cash management fund based upon the value
    of the underlying investments. Underlying investments are valued
    using quoted market prices, if available. If quoted market
    prices are not available due to an inactive market, adjustments
    using unobservable inputs are required to determine the fair
    value. Because of these unobservable inputs, the Company
    recognizes the fair value of its investment as a Level 3
    valuation. The following table presents additional information
    about this investment in which the Company has utilized
    Level 3 inputs to determine fair value.

KCSR
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    April 28, 2006, KCS, KCSR and the other subsidiary
    guarantors named therein entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement (the “2006 Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of $371.1 million with The Bank of Nova
    Scotia and other lenders named in the 2006 Credit Agreement.
    Proceeds from the 2006 Credit Agreement were used to refinance
    all amounts outstanding under KCSR’s previous credit
    agreement. The 2006 Credit Agreement initially consisted of a
    $125.0 million revolving credit facility with a letter of
    credit sublimit of $25.0 million and swing line advances of
    up to $15.0 million, and a $246.1 million term loan
    facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”). On May 31,
    2007, KCSR entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 Credit
    Agreement which provided for a new $75.0 million term loan
    facility (the “Term Loan C Facility”) under the 2006
    Credit Agreement. Proceeds from advances under the Term Loan C
    Facility were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the
    revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears
    interest at either LIBOR, or an alternate base rate, plus a
    spread based on the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in
    the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Term Loan B Facility bears
    interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points or the alternative
    base rate plus 75 basis points. The Term Loan C Facility
    bears interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points or the
    alternative base rate plus 50 basis points. The 2006 Credit
    Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit certain
    actions, including, but not limited to, KCS’ ability to
    incur debt, create or suffer to exist liens, make prepayment of
    particular debt, pay dividends, make investments, engage in
    transactions with stockholders and affiliates, issue capital
    stock, sell certain assets, and engage in mergers and
    consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions. In addition,
    KCS must meet certain consolidated interest coverage and
    leverage ratios. Failure to maintain compliance with the
    covenants could constitute a default which could accelerate the
    payment of any outstanding amounts under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. Borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement are
    secured by substantially all of the Company’s domestic
    assets and are guaranteed by the majority of its domestic
    subsidiaries.

The final maturity date for the revolving credit facility is
    April 28, 2011 and the final maturity date for the Term
    Loan B Facility and the Term Loan C Facility is April 28,
    2013. The 2006 Credit Agreement, however, provides for an
    earlier termination date which is 90 days prior to the
    final maturity date of the outstanding KCSR


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009 (the
    “7


/


% Senior
    Notes”) unless the 2006 Credit Agreement facilities are
    rated at least Ba3 by Moody’s Investor Service
    (“Moody’s”) and BB+ by Standard &
    Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) in each case,
    with at least stable outlooks, or prior to such date, the


/


% Senior
    Notes have been refinanced in full, or an amount sufficient to
    indefeasibly repay such


/


% Senior
    Notes has been deposited with the applicable note trustee. The
    final maturity date of the


/


% Senior
    Notes is currently June 15, 2009. Based upon the
    aforementioned termination provision, the rating criterion of
    S&P has not been met, resulting in a maturity date of
    March 17, 2009. The Company repurchased $176.6 million
    of the


/


% Senior
    Notes on January 29, 2009 and intends to purchase or
    defease the balance of the notes prior to March 17, 2009.
    The Company’s obligations outstanding under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement are classified as current debt. As of
    December 31, 2008, advances under the revolving credit
    facility totaled $100.0 million and the Term Loan B and
    Term Loan C facility balances were $240.0 million and
    $73.9 million, respectively. Revolver availability as of
    December 31, 2008 was $25.0 million.

On January 31, 2007, KCS provided written notice to the
    lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement of certain
    representation and other defaults under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement arising from the potential defaults which existed
    under the KCSR indentures governing the KCSR


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2008 (the
    “9


/


% Senior
    Notes”) and


/


% Senior
    Notes as described in the second paragraph under Senior Notes
    below. These defaults limited KCSR’s access to the
    revolving credit facility. In its notice of default, the Company
    also requested that the lenders waive these defaults. On
    February 5, 2007, the Company received a waiver of such
    defaults from all of the lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement.

Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2008
    KCSR had outstanding $200.0 million of


/


% Senior
    Notes issued in June of 2002 and due June 15, 2009,
    $275.0 million of 8.0% Senior Notes (the
    “8.0% Senior Notes”)



Kansas

issued in May of 2008 and due June 1, 2015, and
    $190.0 million of 13.0% Senior Notes (the
    “13.0% Senior Notes”) issued in December of 2008
    and due December 28, 2013. These senior unsecured notes
    bear interest at a fixed annual rate which is paid
    semi-annually. These senior notes are general unsecured
    obligations of KCSR but are guaranteed by KCS and certain of its
    domestic subsidiaries.

On January 29, 2007, the Company commenced a consent
    solicitation to amend the indentures under which the


/


% Senior
    Notes and


/


% Senior
    Notes were issued. The Company identified certain
    inconsistencies in the language of the indentures which
    prevented KCS from obtaining a coverage ratio of at least
    2.00:1. The purpose of the consent solicitation was to
    (i) resolve an inconsistency in the inclusion of certain
    expenses, but not the income, of restricted subsidiaries in the
    calculation of the consolidated coverage ratio under the
    indentures, (ii) amend the definition of refinancing
    indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain related premiums,
    interest, fees and expenses in permitted refinancing
    indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any defaults
    arising from certain actions taken in the absence of such
    proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    obtained the requisite consents from the holders of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and


/


% Senior
    Notes to amend their respective indentures as described above
    and executed supplemental indentures containing such amendments
    and waivers.

On May 8, 2008, pursuant to an offer to purchase, KCSR
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $200.0 million


/


% Senior
    Notes. KCSR received consents in connection with the tender
    offer and consent solicitation from holders of over 99% of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and purchased the tendered notes in accordance with the
    terms of the tender offer with proceeds received from the
    issuance of $275.0 million of 8.0% Senior Notes.

On May 30, 2008, KCSR issued the 8.0% Senior Notes due
    June 1, 2015, which bear interest semiannually at a fixed
    annual rate of 8.0% and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    by KCS and certain subsidiaries of KCS who guarantee KCSR’s
    2006 Credit Agreement (the “Note Guarantors”). The
    8.0% Senior Notes and the note guarantees rank pari passu
    in right of payment with KCSR’s, KCS’, and the Note
    Guarantors’ existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated
    obligations. A portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the
    8.0% Senior Notes was used to pay $198.7 million of
    the principal amount of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and the applicable premium and expenses associated with
    the redemption and the remaining $1.3 million principal
    amount upon maturity. The remaining proceeds from the issuance
    were used to reduce borrowings under the KCSR revolving credit
    facility and for general corporate purposes. The
    8.0% Senior Notes are redeemable in whole or in part prior
    to June 1, 2012 by paying the greater of either 101% of the
    principal amount or a “make whole” premium and in
    whole or in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed
    as a percentage of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest: 2012 — 104%, 2013 — 102%,
    2014 — 100%. In addition, KCSR may redeem up to 35% of
    the notes using the proceeds of one or more equity offerings
    completed before June 1, 2011.

On December 18, 2008, KCSR issued the 13.0% Senior
    Notes due December 15, 2013, which bear interest
    semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 13.0% were issued at a
    discount to par value, resulting in a $22.0 million
    discount and a yield to maturity of 16.5% and are fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed by KCS and the Note Guarantors. The
    13.0% Senior Notes and the note guarantees rank pari passu
    in right of payment with KCSR’s, KCS’, and the Note
    Guarantors’ existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated
    obligations. KCS used the net proceeds from the offering, along
    with other borrowings, to repurchase the


/


% Senior
    Notes tendered under an offer to purchase. The notes are
    redeemable at KCSR’s option in whole or in part prior to
    December 15, 2011 by paying the greater of either 101% of
    the principal amount or a “make whole” premium and in
    whole or in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed
    as percentages of principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest: 2011 — 113%, 2012 — 106.5%. In
    addition, KCSR may redeem up to 35% of the notes using the
    proceeds of one or more equity offerings completed before
    December 15, 2010.

On January 14, 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase, KCSR
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $200.0 million KCSR

Tex-Mex
    Debt.

RRIF Loan Agreement.

On June 28, 2005,
    Tex-Mex entered into an agreement with the Federal Railroad
    Administration (“FRA”) to borrow $50.0 million to
    be used for infrastructure improvements which are expected to
    increase efficiency and capacity in order to accommodate growing
    freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA corridor. The note
    bears interest at 4.29% annually and the principal balance
    amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of July 13, 2030.
    The loan was made under the Railroad Rehabilitation and
    Improvement Financing (“RRIF”) Program administered by
    the FRA. The loan is guaranteed by Mexrail, which has issued a
    Pledge Agreement in favor of the lender equal to the gross
    revenues earned by Mexrail on per-car fees on traffic crossing
    the International Rail Bridge in Laredo, Texas.

On February 16, 2007, Tex-Mex and the FRA entered into
    Amendment No. 1 and Waiver No. 1 to the loan
    agreement, the purpose of which was to eliminate the obligation
    of Tex-Mex to provide audited annual financial statements to the
    FRA and to waive Tex-Mex’s failure to do so since entering
    into the loan agreement. To induce the FRA to agree to such
    amendment and waiver, the Company has agreed to provide the FRA
    with its audited annual financial statements and unaudited
    quarterly statements and has also agreed to guaranty the
    scheduled principal payment installments due to the FRA from
    Tex-Mex under the loan agreement on a rolling five-year basis.

KCSM
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan.

On
    June 14, 2007, KCSM entered into a new unsecured credit
    agreement (the “2007 KCSM Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of up to $111.0 million, consisting of a
    revolving credit facility of up to $81.0 million, and a
    term loan facility of $30.0 million with Bank of America,
    N.A., BBVA Bancomer, S.A., Institución de Banca
    Múltiple, and the other lenders named in the 2007 KCSM
    Credit Agreement. KCSM used the proceeds from the 2007 KCSM
    Credit Agreement to pay (a) all amounts outstanding under
    the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement, and to pay all fees and expenses
    related to the refinancing of the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement,
    (b) to pay all amounts outstanding in respect of
    KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2007, (c) to refinance a portion of KCSM’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012, (d) to pay all amounts outstanding under
    KCSM’s Bridge Loan Agreement dated April 30, 2007, and
    (e) for general corporate purposes. The maturity date for
    the revolving credit facility is December 30, 2011, and the
    maturity date for the term loan facility is June 29, 2012.
    Loans under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement bear interest at
    LIBOR plus a spread based on KCSM’s leverage ratio as
    defined under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement. The 2007 KCSM
    Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or prohibit
    certain actions that are customary for these types of
    agreements. In addition, KCSM must meet certain consolidated
    interest coverage ratios, consolidated leverage ratios, and
    fixed charge coverage ratios. KCSM was in compliance with the
    2007 KCSM Credit Agreement as of February 13, 2009 and has
    access to the revolving credit facility. At December 31,
    2008, there were no advances under the revolving credit facility
    with $81.0 million remaining available under the facility.

On December 19, 2007, KCSM entered into Amendment and
    Waiver No. 1 to the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement (“KCSM
    Amendment and Waiver No. 1”) to modify certain terms
    to permit the KCSM to finance the acquisition of new locomotives
    by incurring indebtedness on an accelerated basis as compared to
    the original terms contained in the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement.
    The KCSM Amendment and Waiver No. 1 also waived certain
    prospective defaults under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement as of
    the quarter ended December 31, 2007, as a result of the
    acquisition of the new locomotives in the fourth quarter of
    2007, in



Kansas

    Statements — (Continued)

order to permit the Company sufficient time to complete its
    financing of the new locomotives in the first quarter of 2008.

On December 19, 2008, KCSM entered into Amendment
    No. 2 (“KCSM Amendment No. 2”) to the
    2007 KCSM Credit Agreement. KCSM Amendment No. 2
    deletes the defined term “Additional Dividends” and
    modifies the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement to permit the Company to
    declare a Restricted Payment, as defined in the 2007 Credit
    Agreement, during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and
    pay such Restricted Payment in one or more fiscal quarters
    during the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2009.

On February 11, 2009, KCSM entered into Amendment
    No. 3 and Waiver No. 2 (“KCSM Amendment
    No. 3”) to the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement. KCSM
    Amendment No. 3 amended Section 7.4 of the
    2007 KCSM Credit Agreement to permit KCSM’s loan of
    $4.2 million to PCRC made on December 28, 2007. KCSM
    Amendment No. 3 also waived any Defaults (as defined in the

5.737% Locomotive Financing Agreement.

On
    February 26, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing agreement
    for an aggregate amount of $72.8 million. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance 85% of the purchase price of forty new
    SD70ACe locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM in late 2007
    and early 2008.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

KCSM granted the lender a security interest in the locomotives
    to secure the loan. The financing agreement requires KCSM to
    make thirty equal semi-annual principal payments of
    approximately $2.4 million plus interest at an annual rate
    of 5.737%, with the final payment due and payable on
    February 28, 2023.

6.195% Locomotive Financing Agreement.

On
    September 24, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing agreement
    with DVB Bank AG (“DVB”). KCSM received the loan
    principal amount under the financing agreement of
    $52.2 million on September 26, 2008. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance approximately 80% of the purchase price of
    twenty-nine ES44AC locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM
    in June 2008. KCSM granted DVB a security interest in the
    locomotives to secure the loan. The financing agreement requires
    KCSM to make sixty equal quarterly principal payments plus
    interest at an annual rate of 6.195%, with the final payment due
    and payable on September 29, 2023.

Both locomotive financing agreements contains representations,
    warranties and covenants typical of such equipment loan
    agreements. Events of default in the financing agreements
    include, but are not limited to, certain payment defaults,
    certain bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and the failure
    to perform any covenants or agreements contained in the
    financing agreement. Any event of default could trigger
    acceleration of KCSM’s payment obligations under the terms
    of the financing agreements.

Other
    Debt Provisions.

Other Agreements, Guarantees, Provisions and
    Restrictions.

The Company has debt agreements
    customary for these types of debt instruments and for borrowers
    with similar credit ratings containing restrictions on
    subsidiary indebtedness, advances and transfers of assets, and
    sale and leaseback transactions, as well as requiring compliance
    with various financial covenants. Because of certain financial
    covenants contained in the debt agreements, however, maximum
    utilization of the Company’s available lines of credit may
    be restricted.

Change in Control Provisions.

Certain loan
    agreements and debt instruments entered into or guaranteed by
    the Company and its subsidiaries provide for default in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    particular subsidiaries of the Company.

Leases
    and Debt Maturities.

The Company leases transportation equipment, as well as office
    and other operating facilities, under various capital and
    operating leases. Rental expenses under operating leases were
    $137.1 million, $129.4 million, and
    $136.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007, and 2006, respectively. Contingent rentals and sublease

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would

Income
    Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
    reported on the Company’s income tax return, and deferred
    tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by
    the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
    differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as
    appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
    considered likely to be realized.

Difference Attributable to Foreign
    Investments.

At December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s book basis exceeded the tax basis of its foreign
    investments by $755.0 million. The Company has not provided
    a deferred income tax liability for the income taxes, if any,
    which might become payable on the realization of this basis
    difference because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest
    in foreign investments the operating earnings which gave rise to
    the basis differential or remit the earnings in tax-free
    transactions as discussed below. Moreover, the Company has no
    other plans to realize this basis differential by a sale of its
    interests in foreign investments. If the earnings were to be
    remitted in a taxable transaction, as of December 31, 2008,
    the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company would incur gross federal income taxes of
    $264.3 million which would be partially offset by foreign
    tax credits.

Changes in Tax Law.

On October 1, 2007
    the Entrepreneurial Tax of Unique Rate (referred to by its
    Spanish acronym, IETU or “Flat Tax”) in Mexico was
    enacted. The Flat Tax law became effective on January 1,
    2008 and replaced the Asset Tax law. The Flat Tax applies to a
    different tax base than the regular income tax and will be paid
    if the Flat Tax exceeds the ordinary income tax computed under
    existing law.

Tax Carryovers.

In prior years, the Company
    has generated both U.S. federal and state net operating
    losses. The losses are carried forward 20 years for federal
    and from 5 to 20 years for state. Both the federal and
    state loss carryovers are analyzed each year to determine the
    likelihood of realization. The U.S. federal loss carryover
    at December 31, 2008 is $76.7 million and if not used,
    would begin to expire in 2021. In addition, the Company has
    $15.8 million of tax credits consisting primarily of
    $13.6 million of track maintenance credits which, if not
    used, will begin to expire in 2025, and $1.9 million of
    alternative minimum tax credits which do not have an expiration
    period.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and separate
    tax filings from as early as 1993. The loss carryovers may
    expire as early as December 31, 2009 and as late as
    December 31, 2028. The state loss carryover at
    December 31, 2008 is $443.8 million, indicating a tax
    benefit of $18.5 million, of which it is expected that
    $163.3 million, producing a tax benefit of
    $7.1 million, will be realized.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at December 31, 2008 are
    $896.2 million, of which $21.3 million will expire in
    2016 and the remaining $874.9 million will expire in 2046.
    A deferred tax asset was recorded in prior periods for the
    expected future tax benefit of these losses which will be
    carried forward to reduce only ordinary Mexican income tax
    payable in future years. With the addition of the Flat Tax, the
    losses are not projected to completely eliminate future tax
    liabilities. A valuation allowance of $11.5 million was
    recorded in 2008 to reflect the reduced expected tax benefit to
    be derived from these carryovers.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results
    of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to
    realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances,
    related to loss carryovers and tax credits.

Uncertain Tax Positions.

In June 2006, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation
    Number 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires the Company to
    recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax
    position only if the impact is more likely than not of being
    sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the
    position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods and disclosure. The provisions of FIN 48 were
    effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. In
    2007, the Company recognized a cumulative effect of the change
    in accounting principle of $1.3 million recorded as a
    decrease to opening retained earnings. A reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as
    follows (

The remaining $2.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits
    would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized and is
    not expected to change in the next twelve months.

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are
    included in income before taxes on the income statement. As a
    result of the IRS examination settlement, accrued interest and
    penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was reduced from
    $15.8 million to $0.1 million as of December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2008, respectively. For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a reduction
    of approximately $5.6 million in interest and penalty
    expense. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the Company recognized approximately $2.3 million and
    $4.0 million in interest and penalty expense, respectively.

The Company has effectively settled the audit of the
    U.S. consolidated federal income tax returns for the years
    1997 through 2002. A current income tax liability has been
    accrued for the anticipated outcome. The U.S. federal
    statute of limitations has closed for years prior to 1997 and
    for 2003. The statute of limitations for various states has
    closed for years prior to 2005. Tax returns filed in Mexico
    through 2002 are closed to examination by the taxing authorities
    in Mexico. The 2003 Mexico tax return is currently under
    examination. The Company believes that an adequate provision has
    been made for any adjustment (taxes and interest) that will be
    assessed for all open years.

Redemption of Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock.

On June 12, 2008,
    the Company called for redemption all of the outstanding shares
    of its 4.25% Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred
    Stock”) with a redemption date of July 15, 2008 (the
    “Redemption Date”). The holders of the
    outstanding shares had the option to redeem at a redemption
    price of $500 per share or convert each share into
    33.4728 shares of KCS common stock. Each share converted
    also received an appropriate number of common stock or other
    preferred stock purchase rights under KCS’ 2005 Rights
    Agreement. All 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred
    Stock were converted into 13,389,109 shares of common stock.

Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock.

On December 9, 2005, KCS completed
    the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its 5.125%
    Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per
    share (“Series D Preferred Stock”). Each share of
    Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into
    33.3333 shares of KCS common stock, subject to certain
    adjustments. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are
    cumulative and payable quarterly in any combination of cash and
    KCS common stock, as declared by the KCS Board of Directors, at
    the rate of 5.125% per annum of the liquidation preference of
    $1,000. The Series D Preferred Stock ranks senior to the
    common stock and to each class or series of KCS capital stock
    that has terms that provide that such class or series will rank
    junior to the Series D Preferred Stock. On or after
    February 20, 2011, KCS may convert all of the Series D
    Preferred Stock into common stock at the then prevailing
    conversion rate, but only if the closing sale price of the
    common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect
    equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference for 20
    trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, and
    if KCS has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the
    dividend payment date immediately preceding the forced
    conversion date.

Upon certain designated events (a “fundamental
    change”), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may,
    subject to legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or
    all of the shares, which KCS may pay in either cash, in shares
    of KCS stock or any combination thereof, at KCS’ option.
    Since KCS has the ability in this event to pay the redemption
    price in KCS common stock (which is not required to be
    registered), the Series D Preferred Stock is classified as
    permanent equity capital. The number of shares to be issued
    would be based upon the value of KCS common stock at that time
    but in no event will the number of shares issued on the
    occurrence of a fundamental change exceed 52.5 million
    shares.

Dividend Restrictions.

Following completion of
    the preparation of the 2005 financial statements of KCS, the
    Company determined that its Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as
    defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% senior
    notes and


/


% senior
    notes) was less than 2.0:1. As a result, pursuant to the terms
    of each KCSR indenture, the Company was unable to pay cash
    dividends on its Series C Preferred Stock and dividends in
    cash or shares of KCS common stock on its Series D
    Preferred Stock. The dividends accumulated until such ratio
    increased to at least 2.0:1. On January 12, 2007, KCS
    declared a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock and
    Series D Preferred Stock for all outstanding arrear
    dividends. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, KCS is current
    with respect to its Preferred Stock dividend payments.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

On September 27,
    2005, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the
    Company’s common stock to stockholders of record as of the
    close of business on October 12, 2005, replacing a previous
    Rights Agreement that expired on October 12, 2005. Each
    right entitles the stockholder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or
    in certain circumstances, common stock, other securities, cash
    or other assets), at a price of $100 per share (both shares and
    price are subject to adjustment periodically to prevent
    dilution). The rights are traded with the Company’s common
    stock.

The Rights Plan has certain anti-takeover provisions that may
    cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire the Company without the approval of the Board of
    Directors. The Rights Plan will not interfere with any offer for
    all of the outstanding common stock that has the approval of the
    Independent Directors. The rights will become exercisable after
    a non-approved person or group has acquired, or a tender offer
    is made for, 15% or more of the common stock of the Company (13%
    or more in the case of certain acquisitions by “Adverse
    Persons”). Right holders (other than the acquiring person
    or group) may then exercise their rights at the then current
    purchase price, and receive the number of shares of Preferred
    Stock (or in certain circumstances, common stock) having a
    market value of two times the purchase price of the rights.
    Additionally, if the Company is thereafter merged into another
    entity, or if more than 50% of the Company’s consolidated
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, holders of the
    rights may exercise their rights at the then current purchase
    price and receive common stock of the acquirer equal to two
    times the purchase price of the rights. KCS may redeem the
    rights for $0.0025 per right until a triggering acquisition. The
    rights expire October 11, 2010.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and
    certain of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with
    employees whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a
    change in control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock
    options become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
    automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
    specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
    trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
    entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts on December 31, 2008
    and 2007, were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at
    the time of any such change in control, the most significant
    factor of which would be the highest price paid for KCS common
    stock by a party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
    Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Note 10.

Share-Based
    Compensation

On October 7, 2008, the Company’s stockholders
    approved the Kansas City Southern 2008 Stock Option and
    Performance Award Plan (the “2008 Plan”). The 2008
    plan became effective on October 14, 2008 and replaces the
    Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and
    Performance Award Plan (the “1991 Plan”). The 2008
    Plan provides for the granting of up to 2.3 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock to eligible persons as
    defined in the 2008 Plan. Outstanding equity awards granted
    under the 1991 Plan and the 2008 Plan (the “Plans”)
    are to be governed by the terms and conditions of each
    individual plan and the related award agreements.

Stock Option Plan.

Options will be granted
    under the 2008 Plan at 100% of the closing market price of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant. Under the 1991,
    options were granted at 100% of the average market price of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant. Options generally
    have a 5 year cliff vesting period and are exercisable over
    the 10 year contractual term, except that options
    outstanding with limited rights (“LRs”) or limited
    stock appreciation rights (“LSARs”), become
    immediately exercisable upon certain defined circumstances
    constituting a change in control of the Company. The Plans
    include provisions for stock appreciation rights, LRs and LSARs.
    All outstanding options include LSARs, except for options
    granted to

non-employee Directors prior to 1999. The grant date fair value,
    less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to expense on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:

The Company has not paid dividends to common shareholders since
    January of 2000 and currently does not expect to pay dividends
    to common stockholders in the future. The expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock
    price over a term equal to the estimated life of the options.
    The risk-free interest rate is determined based on the
    U.S. Treasury rates approximating the expected life of the
    options granted, which represents the period of time the awards
    are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical
    experience of similar awards.

    Plan.

Nonvested Stock.

The Plans provide for the
    granting of nonvested stock awards to officers and other
    designated employees. The grant date fair value is based on the
    average market price of the stock (under the 1991 Plan) or the
    closing market price (under the 2008 Plan) on the date of the
    grant. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment
    terminates during the vesting period, which is generally five
    year cliff vesting for employees and one year for directors. The
    grant date fair value of nonvested shares, less estimated
    forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period.

    $2.5 million and $1.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, $13.4 million of unrecognized
    compensation costs related to nonvested stock is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted — average period of
    1.45 years. The fair value (at vest date) of shares vested
    during the year ended December 31, 2008, was
    $5.1 million.

Performance Based Awards.

During 2008 and
    2007, the Company granted performance based nonvested stock
    awards. The awards granted establish an annual target number of
    shares that generally vest at the end of a three year requisite
    service period following the grant date. In addition to the
    three year service condition,



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the number of nonvested shares to be received depends on the
    attainment of performance goals based on the following annual
    measures: operating ratio, earnings before interest, tax,
    depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and return on capital
    employed. The number of nonvested shares ultimately earned will
    range from zero to 200% of the annual target award.

The performance shares earned in 2008 and 2007 were 102,318 and
    122,983 which was approximately 62% and 120% of the annual
    target award granted for the 2008 and 2007 performance periods,
    respectively. For the 2009 performance period, participants in
    the aggregate can earn up to a maximum of 353,838 shares.

The Company expenses the grant date fair value of the awards
    which are probable of being earned based on forecasted annual
    performance goals over the three year performance period.
    Compensation expense on performance based awards was
    $1.5 million and $3.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total income tax
    benefit recognized in the income statement for performance based
    awards was $0.5 million and $1.1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, $1.3 million of unrecognized
    compensation cost related to performance based awards is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    0.6 years. The unrecognized compensation cost includes only
    the amount determined to be probable of being earned based upon
    the attainment of the annual performance goals. The fair value
    (at vest date) of shares vested for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 was $1.4 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), established in 1977,
    provides substantially all full-time employees of the Company,
    certain subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities, with
    the right to subscribe to an aggregate of 11.4 million
    shares of common stock. The ESPP is subject to annual approval
    by the Company’s Board of Directors. Employees may elect to
    withhold an amount from payroll on the offering date in exchange
    for rights to purchase a fixed number of designated shares of
    the Company’s common stock.

For offerings under the Twentieth, Nineteenth, and Eighteenth
    Offerings, the purchase prices for shares was equal to 90% of
    the average market price on either the exercise date or the
    offering date, whichever is lower. Under SFAS 123R, both
    the 10% discount in grant price and the 90% share option are
    valued to derive the award’s fair value. The awards vest
    and the expense is recognized ratably over one year.

Profit
    Sharing and Other Postretirement Benefits

Health and Welfare.

Certain
    U.S. employees that have met age and service requirements
    are eligible for life insurance coverage and medical benefits
    during retirement. The retiree medical plan is contributory and
    provides benefits to retirees, their covered dependents and
    beneficiaries. The plan provides for annual adjustments to
    retiree contributions, and also contains, depending on the
    coverage selected, certain deductibles, co-payments,
    co-insurance, and coordination with Medicare. Certain management
    employees also maintain their status under a collective
    bargaining agreement, which permits them access to
    post-retirement medical under the multi-employer plan described
    below. The life insurance plan is non-contributory and covers
    retirees only. The Company’s policy, in most cases, is to
    fund benefits payable under these plans as the obligations
    become due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds
    held in a life insurance company) exist with respect to life
    insurance benefits.

KCSM Union Retirement Benefit.

In the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Company and the union entered into
    additional negotiations related to this benefit. The current
    calculated benefit liability is based on a statutory calculation
    under Mexican law which considers various factors such as the
    employees’ salary at the time of retirement and the number
    of years of credited service. In addition, the benefit includes
    the funding of a defined contribution benefit where individual
    accounts for employees who contribute a fixed percentage of
    their pay is matched by a certain percentage of the amount
    voluntarily contributed by the employee. As of the date of this
    filing, the Company was still negotiating with the union
    regarding this benefit and although the details of this benefit
    continue to be discussed, based on current facts, management
    believes that the reserve established approximates the liability
    for this benefit. Management believes that it is more likely
    that the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

benefit liability will be reduced than the probability of a
    material increase in the liability associated with this post
    retirement benefit and has recorded its best estimate.

The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its
    retirement benefit obligations.

Assumptions

The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs
    are selected based on current and expected market conditions.
    Discount rates are selected based on low risk government bonds
    with cash flows approximating the timing of expected benefit
    payments. The Mexico bond market is utilized for the KCSM
    retirement obligation and the U.S. bond market is utilized
    for the U.S. health and welfare obligation. The expected
    rate of return on life insurance plan assets is determined using
    historical and forward looking returns for similar investments
    over the period that the benefits are expected to be paid.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit
    obligations were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The Company’s health care costs, excluding former Gateway

    in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) with a maximum
    annual increase of 5%. Accordingly, health care costs in excess
    of the CPI limit will be borne by the plan participants, and
    therefore assumptions regarding health care cost trends are not
    applicable. The following table presents the assumed health care

    benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care
    and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees and
    certain retirees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as
    incurred and were $3.4 million, $2.8 million, and
    $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The Company
    sponsors the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the
    “401(k) plan”), whereby participants can choose to
    make contributions in the form of salary deductions pursuant to
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
    matches 401(k) contributions up to a maximum of 5% of
    compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, the Company expensed $1.8 million,
    $1.6 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, related
    to the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

Note 12.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which,
    except as set forth below, are of an ordinary, routine nature
    and incidental to its operations. Included in these proceedings
    are various tort claims brought by current and former employees
    for job related injuries and by third parties for injuries
    related to railroad operations. KCS aggressively defends these
    matters and has established liability reserves, which management
    believes are adequate to cover expected costs. Although it is
    not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding, in
    the opinion of management, other than those proceedings
    described in detail below, such proceedings and actions should
    not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition and liquidity.
    However, a material adverse outcome in one or more of these
    proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the
    operating results of a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s
    U.S. operations are subject to extensive federal, state and
    local environmental laws and regulations. The major
    U.S. environmental laws to which the Company is subject
    include, among others, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA,”
    also known as the Superfund law), the Toxic Substances Control
    Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Hazardous
    Materials Transportation Act. CERCLA can impose joint and
    several liabilities for cleanup and investigation costs, without
    regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on current
    and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well as those
    who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous
    substances. The Company does not believe that compliance with
    the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will
    impair its competitive capability or result in any material
    additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs.
    The Company is, however, subject to environmental remediation
    costs as described below.

The Company’s Mexico operations are subject to Mexican
    federal and state laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment through the establishment of
    standards for water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise
    pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling
    of hazardous and solid waste. The Mexican government may bring
    administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic
    sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and
    temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
    railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
    chemicals industry, the Company transports hazardous materials
    and has a professional team available to respond to and handle
    environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
    materials. Additionally, the Company is a partner in the
    Responsible
    Care

®

program and, as a result, has initiated additional
    environmental, health and safety programs. The Company performs
    ongoing reviews and evaluations of the various environmental
    programs and issues within the Company’s operations, and,
    as necessary, takes actions intended to limit the Company’s
    exposure to potential liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
    industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
    Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
    investigation and cleanup of



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

contaminants, claims alleging personal injury, or property
    damage as the result of exposures to, or release of, hazardous
    substances. Although the Company is responsible for
    investigating and remediating contamination at several
    locations, based on currently available information, the Company
    does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
    collectively, to have a material impact on its financial
    position or cash flows. Should the Company become subject to
    more stringent cleanup requirements at these sites, discover
    additional contamination, or become subject to related personal
    or property damage claims, the Company could incur material
    costs in connection with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
    costs related to past activities when the Company’s
    obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
    operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
    liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
    undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
    may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
    Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
    management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or cash flows.

Environmental remediation expense was $6.1 million and
    $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively, and was included in Casualties and insurance
    expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally,
    as of December 31, 2008, KCS had a liability for
    environmental remediation of $6.4 million. This amount was
    derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    SFAS 5.

Casualty Claim Reserves.

The Company’s
    casualty and liability reserve is based on actuarial studies
    performed on an undiscounted basis. This reserve is based on
    personal injury claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred
    but not yet reported. While the ultimate amount of claims
    incurred is dependent on various factors, it is
    management’s opinion that the recorded liability is a
    reasonable estimate of aggregate future payments. Adjustments to
    the liability are reflected as operating expenses in the period
    in which changes to estimates are known. Casualty claims in
    excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to certain
    coverage amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of
    occurrence. The activity in the reserve follows

(in millions):

The casualty claim reserve balance as of December 31, 2008
    is based on an updated study of casualty reserves for data
    through November 30, 2008 and review of the last
    month’s experience. The activity for the twelve months
    ended December 31, 2008 primarily relates to the net
    settlements and the reserves for Federal Employers Liability Act
    (“FELA”), third-party, and occupational illness
    claims. The changes to the reserve in the current year compared
    to the prior year primarily reflect a large litigation
    settlement in 2007 and the current accruals related to the trend
    of loss experience since the date of the prior study.

Reflecting potential uncertainty surrounding the outcome of
    casualty claims, it is reasonably possible based on assessments
    that future costs to settle casualty claims may range from
    approximately $86 million to $95 million. While the
    final outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
    certainty, management believes that the $90.7 million
    recorded is the best estimate of the Company’s future
    obligations for the settlement of casualty claims at
    December 31, 2008. The most sensitive assumptions for
    personal injury accruals are the expected average cost per claim
    and the projected frequency rates for the number of claims that
    will ultimately result in payment. A 5% increase or decrease in
    either the expected average cost per claim or the frequency

    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

rate for claims with payments would result in an approximate
    $4.5 million increase or decrease in the Company’s
    recorded personal injury reserves.

Management believes that previous reserve estimates for prior
    claims were reasonable based on current information available.
    The Company is continuing its practice of accruing monthly for
    estimated claim costs, including any changes recommended by
    studies performed and evaluation of recent known trends; based
    on this practice, management believes all accruals are
    appropriately reflected.

Antitrust Lawsuit.

As of December 31,
    2008, 29 putative class actions were on file against KCSR, along
    with the other Class I U.S. railroads (and, in some
    cases, the Association of American Railroads), in various
    Federal district courts alleging that the railroads conspired to
    fix fuel surcharges in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. On
    November 6, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
    Litigation ordered that these putative class action cases be
    consolidated for pretrial handling before the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia, where the matters
    remain pending (“the Multidistrict Litigation”). All
    of the plaintiffs in the Multidistrict Litigation filed a
    Consolidated Amended Complaint on April 15, 2008. KCSR was
    not named as a defendant in that Consolidated Amended Complaint
    pursuant to an agreement with the Multidistrict Litigation
    plaintiffs to toll the statute of limitations, and the
    Multidistrict Litigation will not proceed with KCSR as a party.
    In any event, KCSR maintains there is no merit to the price
    fixing allegations asserted against the Company. If KCSR is
    named as a defendant in lawsuits making such claims in the
    future, either in the Multidistrict Litigation or otherwise, the
    Company intends to vigorously contest such allegations.

The New Jersey Attorney General’s office, which had sought
    information regarding fuel surcharges from KCSR and other
    railroads, has informed KCSR that it is discontinuing its
    investigation of KCSR with respect to fuel surcharges.

Certain Disputes with Ferromex.

KCSM and

Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.

(“Ferromex”)
    both initiated administrative proceedings seeking a
    determination by the Mexican

Secretaría de
    Comunicaciones y Transportes

(“Ministry of
    Communications and Transportation” or “SCT”) of
    the rates that the companies should pay each other in connection
    with the use of trackage rights, interline and terminal
    services. The SCT issued a ruling setting the rates for trackage
    rights in March of 2002, and a ruling setting the rates for
    interline and terminal services in August of 2002. KCSM and
    Ferromex challenged both rulings.

Following the trial and appellate court decisions, in February
    of 2006 the Mexican Supreme Court sustained KCSM’s appeal
    of the SCT’s trackage rights ruling, in effect vacating the
    ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent
    with the Court’s decision. On June 27, 2008, KCSM was
    served with the new ruling issued by the SCT. In this ruling,
    the SCT established the consideration that KCSM and Ferromex
    must pay each other in connection with the use of the trackage
    rights granted in their respective concessions between 2002 and
    2004, and further stated that in the event KCSM and Ferromex
    failed to reach an agreement in connection with the rates for
    the years after 2004, the SCT shall make a determination along
    the same lines. On September 19, 2008, KCSM appealed this
    new ruling with the Mexican

Tribunal Federal de Justicia
    Fiscal y Administrativa

(“Administrative and Fiscal
    Federal Court”).

In April 2005, the Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court ruled
    in favor of KCSM in the challenge to the SCT interline and
    terminal services decision. Ferromex, however, challenged this
    court ruling before the Fifteenth Collegiate Court, and the
    Court ruled in its favor. Both Ferromex and KCSM have challenged
    the rulings on different grounds. This most recent challenge is
    now before the Mexican Supreme Court, which as of the date of
    this filing has yet to issue a decision on the matter.

In addition to the above, Ferromex has filed three commercial
    proceedings against KCSM. In the first claim, which was served
    in 2001 and is related to the payment of consideration for
    interline services, KCSM received a favorable decision and
    Ferromex has been ordered to pay related costs and expenses.
    Although it has not yet done so, Ferromex has the right to
    challenge this decision. KCSM received an unfavorable decision
    in the second claim filed in 2004 and has filed a challenge to
    this judgment, the outcome of which is still



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

pending. The third claim, filed in 2006, is an action for access
    to records related to interline services between 2002 and 2004.
    No decision has been rendered on the third claim. KCSM is
    continually analyzing all of the records related to this dispute
    to determine the adequacy of the reserves for the amounts due to
    as well as due from Ferromex.

KCSM expects various proceedings and appeals related to the
    matters described above to continue over the next few years.
    Although KCSM and Ferromex have challenged these matters based
    on different grounds and these cases continue to evolve,
    management believes the reserves related to these matters are
    adequate and does not believe there will be a future material
    impact to the results of operations arising out of these
    disputes.

Disputes Relating to the Provision of Services to a Mexican
    Subsidiary of a Large U.S. Auto
    Manufacturer.

KCSM is involved in several
    disputes related to providing service to a Mexican subsidiary of
    a large U.S. auto manufacturer (the “Auto
    Manufacturer”).

In March 2008, the Auto Manufacturer filed an arbitration suit
    against KCSM under a contract entered into in 1999 for services
    to the Auto Manufacturer’s plants in Mexico, which, as
    amended, had a stated termination date of January 31, 2008.
    The Auto Manufacturer claims that the contract was implicitly
    extended and continued in effect beyond its stated termination
    date, and that KCSM is therefore required to continue abiding by
    its terms, including, but not limited to, the rates contemplated
    in such contract. KCSM claims that the contract did in fact
    expire on its stated termination date of January 31, 2008,
    and that services rendered thereafter are thus subject to the
    general terms and conditions (including rates) applicable in the
    absence of a specific contract, pursuant to Mexican law.
    Accordingly, KCSM filed a counterclaim against the Auto
    Manufacturer to, among other things, recover the applicable rate
    difference. The Auto Manufacturer is also seeking a declaration
    by the arbitrator that the rates being assessed by KCSM are
    discriminatory, even though the rates being charged are within
    the legal rate limits set by Mexican law for such freight
    transportation. KCSM believes that the facts of this dispute
    provide it with strong legal arguments and intends to vigorously
    defend its claims in this proceeding. As a result, management
    believes the final resolution of these claims will not have any
    material impact on KCSM’s results of operations.

In May 2008, the arbitrator ordered that KCSM continue providing
    the service in the same way and at the same rates as it had done
    through March 2008, and ordered the Auto Manufacturer to provide
    a guaranty by depositing with KCSM the difference between the
    rates under the agreement and KCSM’s rates. KCSM initiated
    a judicial proceeding seeking enforcement of the Auto
    Manufacturer’s obligation to provide the guaranty and on
    January 8, 2009, KCSM received a ruling ordering the Auto
    Manufacturer to deposit the amount of the guaranty with KCSM as
    required by the arbitrator. On February 9, 2009, the Auto
    Manufacturer was granted a provisional injunction to avoid
    making the payment, but was ordered to provide a guaranty for
    the amount as determined by the court. As of the date of this
    filing, the Company has not received the guaranty from the Auto
    Manufacturer as ordered by the court.

In May 2008, the SCT initiated a proceeding against KCSM, at the
    Auto Manufacturer’s request, alleging that KCSM
    impermissibly bundled international rail services and engaged in
    discriminatory pricing practices with respect to rail services
    provided by KCSM to the Auto Manufacturer. If the SCT were to
    determine that KCSM did engage in such actions, the SCT could
    impose sanctions on KCSM. On July 23, 2008, the SCT
    delivered notice to KCSM of new proceedings against KCSM,
    claiming, among other things, that KCSM refused to grant
    Ferromex access to certain trackage over which Ferromex alleges
    it has trackage rights in Coahuila on six different occasions
    and thus denied Ferromex the ability to provide service to the
    Auto Manufacturer at this location.

KCSM does not believe that these SCT proceedings will have a
    material adverse effect on its results of operations or
    financial condition. However, if KCSM is ultimately sanctioned
    in connection with the bundling and discriminatory pricing
    practices alleged by the Auto Manufacturer, any such sanction
    would be considered a “generic” sanction under Mexican
    law (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not specifically
    referred to in



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

specific subsections of the Mexican railway law). If challenges
    against any such sanction are conclusively ruled adversely to
    KCSM and a sanction is effectively imposed, and if the SCT
    imposes other “generic” sanctions on four additional
    occasions over the remaining term of the Concession, KCSM could
    be subject to possible future SCT action seeking revocation of
    its Concession. Likewise, if each of the six refusals to allow
    Ferromex to serve the Auto Manufacturer in Coahuila were to be
    finally decided to warrant a separate sanction, KCSM could be
    subject to a future SCT action seeking revocation of its
    Concession. Revocation of the Concession would materially
    adversely affect KCSM’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

Disputes Relating to the Scope of the Mandatory Trackage
    Rights.

KCSM and Ferromex are parties to various
    cases involving disputes over the application and proper
    interpretation of the mandatory trackage rights. In particular,
    in August 2002, the SCT issued a ruling related to
    Ferromex’s trackage rights in Monterrey, Nuevo León.
    KCSM and Ferromex both appealed the SCT’s ruling and after
    considerable litigation, on September 17, 2008, the Mexican
    Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court announced a decision,
    which if upheld, would grant Ferromex rights that KCSM believes
    to be broader than those set forth in both its and
    Ferromex’s concession titles. KCSM further believes that
    this decision conflicts with current applicable law and with
    relevant judicial precedents and intends to challenge it and to
    continue to pursue all other remedies available to it. KCSM
    believes that there will be no material adverse effect on
    KCSM’s results of operations or financial condition from
    the outcome of this case.

Other SCT Sanction Proceedings.

In April 2006,
    the SCT initiated proceedings against KCSM, claiming that KCSM
    had failed to make certain minimum capital investments projected
    for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year business plan filed with
    the SCT prior to its April 2005 acquisition by Kansas City
    Southern or “KCS” (collectively, the “Capital
    Investment Proceedings”). KCSM believes it made capital
    expenditures exceeding the required amounts. KCSM responded to
    the SCT by providing evidence in support of its investments and
    explaining why it believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May
    2007, KCSM was served with an SCT resolution regarding the
    Capital Investment Proceeding for 2004, where the SCT determined
    that KCSM had indeed failed to make the minimum capital
    investments required for such year, but resolved to impose no
    sanction as this would have been KCSM’s first breach of the
    relevant legal provisions. In June 2007, KCSM was served with an
    SCT resolution regarding the Capital Investment Proceeding for
    2005, where the SCT determined that KCSM had indeed failed to
    make the minimum capital investments required for such year, and
    imposed a fine in the amount of Ps.46,800. KCSM has filed
    actions challenging both the 2004 and 2005 investment plan
    resolutions issued by the SCT. KCSM will have the right to
    challenge any adverse ruling by the Mexican Administrative and
    Fiscal Federal Court.

KCSM believes that even if sanctions are ultimately imposed as a
    consequence of the Capital Investment Proceedings, there will be
    no material adverse effect on its results of operations or
    financial condition. However, each of these potential sanctions
    is considered a “generic” sanction under Mexican law
    (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not specifically referred to
    in specific subsections of the Mexican railway law). If these
    potential sanctions are conclusively ruled adversely against
    KCSM and sanctions are imposed, and if the SCT imposes other
    sanctions related to KCSM’s capital investments or other
    “generic” sanctions on three additional occasions over
    the remaining term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject to
    possible future SCT action seeking revocation of its Concession.
    Such revocation would materially adversely affect the results of
    operations and financial condition of KCSM.

Mancera Proceeding.

In February 2006, Mancera
    Ernst & Young, S.C., (“Mancera”) filed a
    claim against KCSM seeking payment for an additional contingency
    fee for costs and expenses related to Mancera’s
    representation of KCSM in its value added tax or “VAT”
    claim against the Mexican government. Following litigation, KCSM
    was notified on February 10, 2009 that the Appeals Court of
    Mexico City released KCSM from any obligation for damages to
    Mancera but increased the amount of fees to be paid to Mancera
    above the contractual terms outlined in its engagement agreement
    with Mancera as interpreted by KCSM. KCSM intends to appeal this
    decision with the Federal Court and will vigorously defend the
    matter based on the strength of



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the Company’s defenses. In addition, the Company believes
    that it has adequately reserved for its obligation and does not
    believe that the final resolution of this claim will have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Credit Risk.

The Company continually monitors
    risks related to the recent downturn in the economy and certain
    customer receivables concentrations. Significant changes in
    customer concentration or payment terms, deterioration of
    customer credit-worthiness or further weakening in economic
    trends could have a significant impact on the collectability of
    the Company’s receivables and operating results. If the
    financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
    deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
    payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company has
    recorded reserves for uncollectability based on its best
    estimate at December 31, 2008.

PCRC Guarantees and Indemnities.

The Company
    is a guarantor for an equipment loan to PCRC of approximately
    $0.1 million and has issued six irrevocable standby letters
    of credit totaling approximately $4.4 million to fulfill
    the Company’s fifty percent guarantee of additional
    equipment loans. As discussed in Note 3, the Company agreed
    to fund 50% of any debt service reserve or liquidity
    reserve shortfall by PCRC, (reserves which were established by
    PCRC in connection with the issuance of the Notes). At
    December 31, 2008, the Company has issued a standby letter
    of credit in the amount of $4.3 million and has made a loan
    to PCRC of $0.4 million for deposit into the debt service
    reserve account. Additionally, KCS has pledged its shares of
    PCRC as security for PCRC’s 7.0% Senior Secured Notes
    due November 2026.

Note 13.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company does not engage in the trading of derivative
    financial instruments. The Company’s objective for using
    derivative instruments is to manage fuel price risk, foreign
    currency fluctuations, or the variability of forecasted interest
    payments attributable to changes in interest rates. In general,
    the Company enters into derivative transactions in limited
    situations based on management’s assessment of current
    market conditions and perceived risks. However, management
    intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions
    and in doing so, may enter into such transactions more
    frequently as deemed appropriate.

Interest Rate Swaps.

During 2008, the Company
    entered into five forward starting interest rate swaps, which
    have been designated as cash flow hedges under the Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
    (“SFAS 133”). The forward starting interest rate
    swaps effectively convert interest payments from variable rates
    to fixed rates. The hedging instruments have an aggregate
    notional amount of $250.0 million at an average fixed rate
    of 2.71%, with forward starting settlements indexed to the
    three-month LIBOR occurring every quarter, expiring September of
    2010 through March of 2011.

The aforementioned swaps are highly effective as defined by
    SFAS 133 and as a result there will be de minimus
    income statement variability associated with ineffectiveness of
    these hedges. At December 31, 2008, the estimated fair
    value of the forward starting interest rate swaps was an
    unrealized loss of $6.0 million and was recognized in other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company was not a party to
    any fuel swap agreements. Fuel hedging transactions consisting
    of fuel swaps as well as forward purchase commitments resulted
    in an increase in fuel expense of $2.9 million in 2008, and
    a decrease of $0.3 million and $0.7 million in 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The purpose of the
    foreign exchange contracts of KCSM is to limit exposure arising
    from exchange rate fluctuations in its Mexican peso-denominated
    monetary assets and liabilities. Management determines the
    nature and quantity of any hedging transactions based upon net
    asset exposure and market conditions. These foreign currency
    contracts are accounted for as free standing financial
    instruments and accordingly, all changes in fair value are
    recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2008,



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the Company had one Mexican peso call option outstanding in the
    notional amount of $1.7 million based on the average
    exchange rate of Ps. 12.5 per U.S. dollar. The
    estimated fair value of the call option was $0.3 million
    gain at December 31, 2008. This call option will expire on
    May 29, 2009.

As discussed in Note 7, at December 31, 2008, KCSR has
    outstanding $200.0 million of


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009, $275.0 million of 8.0% Senior Notes
    due 2015, and $190.0 million of 13.0% Senior Notes due
    2013, which are unsecured obligations of KCSR, which are also
    jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed
    on an unsecured senior basis by KCS and certain wholly-owned
    domestic subsidiaries. As a result, the following accompanying
    condensed consolidating financial information

(in millions)

has been prepared and presented pursuant to SEC

Regulation S-X

Rule 3-10

“Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of
    guaranteed securities registered or being registered.” This
    condensed information is not intended to present the financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows of the individual
    companies or groups of companies in accordance with
    U.S. GAAP. For the


/


% Senior
    Note issue, KCSR registered exchange notes with the SEC that
    have substantially identical terms and associated guarantees;
    and all of the initial


/


% Senior
    Notes have been exchanged for $200.0 million of registered
    exchange notes. The 8.0% Senior Notes were registered by
    means of an amendment to KCS’ shelf registration statement
    filed and declared effective by the SEC on May 23, 2008.
    The 13.0% Senior Notes were registered under KCS’
    shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on

Geographic
    Information

The Company strategically manages its rail operations as one
    reportable business segment over a single coordinated rail
    network that extends from the midwest and southeast portions of
    the United States south into Mexico and connects with other
    Class I railroads. Financial information reported at this
    level, such as revenues, operating income and cash flows from
    operations, is used by corporate management, including the
    Company’s chief operating decision-maker, in evaluating
    overall financial and operational performance, market
    strategies, as well as the decisions to allocate capital
    resources.

The Company’s strategic initiatives, which drive its
    operational direction, are developed and managed at the
    Company’s headquarters and targets are communicated to its
    various regional activity centers. Corporate management is
    responsible for, among others, KCS’ marketing strategy, the
