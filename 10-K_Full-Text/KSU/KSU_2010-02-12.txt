Business

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding
    company with domestic and international rail operations in North
    America that are strategically focused on the growing
    north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and
    industrial markets in the central United States with major
    industrial cities in Mexico. As used herein, “KCS” or
    the “Company” may refer to Kansas City Southern or, as
    the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of Kansas City
    Southern. KCS and its subsidiaries had approximately
    6,100 employees on December 31, 2009. The Kansas City
    Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), which was founded
    in 1887, is a U.S. Class I railroad. KCSR serves a
    ten-state region in the midwest and southeast regions of the
    United States and has the shortest north/south rail route
    between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the
    Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern
    de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”). KCS previously
    owned this stock through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Grupo
    KCSM, S.A. de C.V. (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as
    Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or
    Grupo TFM. Effective May 8, 2007, Grupo KCSM was merged
    into KCSM. Through its

50-year

concession from the Mexican government (the
    “Concession”), which could expire in 2047 unless
    extended, KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican
    railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic
    portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway between
    Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s
    principal industrial cities and three of its major seaports.
    KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the
    United States and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo,
    Tamaulipas, the largest rail freight interchange point between
    the United States and Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM has the
    right to control and operate the southern half of the rail
    bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River
    between the United States and Mexico.

KCSM provides exclusive rail access to the Port of Lazaro
    Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government is
    developing the port at Lazaro Cardenas principally to serve
    Mexican markets and as an alternative to the congested
    U.S. west coast ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. KCSM
    is the sole provider of rail service to this port, which
    provides an alternate route for Asian traffic bound for the
    eastern, southern and midwestern United States. Traffic at
    Lazaro Cardenas is both domestic and import traffic, consisting
    of intermodal containers, minerals, iron, steel slabs, wire
    rods, and fertilizers.

The Company wholly owns, directly and indirectly through its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”)
    which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex owns a

157-mile

rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of
    Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR
    with KCSM. Through its ownership of Mexrail, the Company owns
    the northern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas. Laredo is
    a principal international gateway through which more than half
    of all rail and truck traffic between the United States and
    Mexico crosses the border. The Company also controls the
    southern half of this bridge through its ownership of KCSM.

The KCS coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex)
    comprises approximately 6,000 miles of main and branch
    lines extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the
    United States south into Mexico and connects with other
    Class I railroads, providing shippers with an effective
    alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to
    Mexico and the southeast and southwest United States through
    less congested interchange hubs.

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), an
    unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by KCS and

Mi-Jack

Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession
    from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the
    Panama Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international container shipping companies with a railway
    transportation option in lieu of the Panama Canal. The
    concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of
    25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional
    25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south
    railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic
    and Pacific Oceans. PCRC’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Panarail Tourism



Company (“Panarail”), operates and promotes commuter
    and tourist passenger service over the Panama Canal Railway.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy-two
    percent owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR
    rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport,
    Louisiana, which is the portion of the KCSR rail line between
    Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian
    Speedway.” Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”)
    through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern
    Railroad Company, owns the remaining twenty-eight percent of
    MSLLC. Ultimately KCS will own seventy percent and NS will own
    thirty percent of MSLLC upon the contribution of additional
    capital by NS to MSLLC;

•

Pabtex, Inc., a wholly-owned and consolidated owner of a bulk
    materials handling facility with deep-water access to the Gulf
    of Mexico at Port Arthur, Texas that stores and transfers
    petroleum coke from rail cars to ships, primarily for export;

•

Trans-Serve, Inc. (doing business as Superior Tie and Timber), a
    wholly-owned and consolidated operator of a railroad wood tie
    treatment facility;

•

Transfin Insurance, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated
    captive insurance company, providing property, general liability
    and certain other insurance coverage to KCS and its subsidiaries
    and affiliates;

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that leases locomotives and other equipment; and

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

MARKETS SERVED

2009 Revenues

Business Mix

Chemical and petroleum.

This sector includes
    products such as petroleum, rubber, plastics and miscellaneous
    chemicals. KCS transports these products to markets in the
    southeast and northeast United States and throughout Mexico
    through interchanges with other rail carriers. The products
    within the chemicals and plastics channels are used in the
    automotive, housing and packaging industries as well as in the
    production of other chemicals

and plastic products. KCS hauls petroleum products
    across its network and as petroleum refineries have continued to
    increase their refining capacity, they have coordinated with KCS
    to develop additional long-term storage opportunities which
    complement a fluid freight railroad operation.

Industrial and consumer products.

KCS’
    rail lines run through the heart of the southeast United States
    timber-producing region. The Company believes that forest
    products made from trees in this region are generally less
    expensive than those from other regions due to lower production
    costs. As a result, southern yellow pine products from the
    southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western
    producers that have experienced capacity reductions because of
    environmental and public policy considerations. KCS serves paper
    mills directly and indirectly through its various short-line
    connections.

This sector also includes metals and ores such as iron, steel,
    zinc and copper. The majority of metals, minerals and ores
    mined, and steel produced in Mexico are consumed within Mexico.
    The volume of Mexican steel exports fluctuates based on global
    market prices. Higher-end finished products such as steel coils
    are used by Mexican manufacturers in automobiles, household
    appliances and other consumer goods which are imported to the
    United States through Nuevo Laredo and through the seaports
    served by KCS’ rail network.



Agriculture and minerals.

The agriculture and
    minerals sector consists primarily of grain and food products.
    Shipper demand for agriculture products is affected by
    competition among sources of grain and grain products, as well
    as price fluctuations in international markets for key
    commodities. In the United States, KCS’ rail lines
    receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for
    delivery to feed mills serving the poultry industry. KCS
    currently serves feed mills along its rail lines throughout the
    midwest and southeast United States and through its marketing
    agreements, KCS has access to sources of corn and other grain in
    the Midwest. United States export grain shipments and Mexico
    import grain shipments include primarily corn, wheat, and
    soybeans transported to Mexico via Laredo and to the Gulf of
    Mexico for overseas destinations. Over the long term, export
    grain shipments to Mexico are expected to increase as a result
    of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports and KCS’
    coordinated rail network is well positioned to meet these
    increases in demand. Food products consists mainly of soybean
    meal, grain meal, oils, canned goods, and sugar. Other shipments
    consist of a variety of products including ores, minerals, clay
    and glass used across North America.

Intermodal.

The intermodal freight business
    consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck
    trailers on behalf of steamship lines, motor carriers, and
    intermodal marketing companies with rail carriers serving as
    long-distance haulers. KCS serves and supports the U.S. and
    Mexican markets, as well as cross border traffic between the
    U.S. and Mexico. In light of the importance of trade
    between Asia and North America, the Company believes the Port of
    Lazaro Cardenas continues to be a strategically beneficial
    location for ocean carriers, manufacturers and retailers. The
    Asia/Mexico commerce is handled through the Port of Lazaro
    Cardenas in conjunction with cross border movement on the single
    coordinated rail network into markets in the U.S. The Company
    also provides premium service to customers over its line from
    Dallas through the Meridian Speedway — a critical link
    in creating the most direct transcontinental line between the
    southwest and southeast U.S.

Automotive.

KCS provides rail transportation
    to every facet of the automotive industry supply chain,
    including automotive manufacturers, assembly plants and
    distribution centers throughout North America. Several
    U.S. automakers have moved assembly plants into central
    Mexico to take advantage of access to lower costs, which has
    driven a shift in production and distribution patterns from the
    U.S. to Mexico. In addition, KCS transports finished
    vehicles imported from Asia through a distribution facility at
    the Port of Lazaro Cardenas. As the automotive industry shifts
    production and distribution patterns, KCS is poised to serve as
    a key partner with the automakers, with the technology and rail
    network to quickly adapt to the automotive industry’s
    evolving transportation requirements.

Coal.

KCS hauls unit trains (trains
    transporting a single commodity from one source to one
    destination) of coal for eight electric generating plants in the
    central United States. The coal originates from the Powder River
    Basin in Wyoming and is interchanged to KCS at Kansas City,
    Missouri. Coal mined in the midwest United States is
    transported in

non-unit

trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills, steel mills,
    and cement companies. Petroleum coke is also included in the
    coal sector, which KCS transports from refineries in the United
    States to cement companies in Mexico as well as to vessels for
    international distribution through the Pabtex export terminal
    located in Port Arthur, Texas.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The Company’s United States operations are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations generally
    applicable to all businesses. Rail operations are also subject
    to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation
    Board (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of
    Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad
    Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and
    state regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over
    disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and
    services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications
    for line extensions and construction, and consolidation or
    merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers.
    DOT and OSHA each has jurisdiction under several federal
    statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
    operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials.
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, the President of the United
    States signed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law,
    which, among other things, revises hours of service rules for
    train and certain other railroad employees, mandates
    implementation of positive train control (a technology designed
    to help prevent

train-to-train

collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work
    zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned)
    at certain locations (including main



line track where toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation
    hazard movements occur or where passenger operations occur) by
    the end of 2015, addresses safety at rail crossings, increases
    the number of safety related employees of the Federal Railroad
    Administration, and increases fines that may be levied against
    railroads for safety violations. State agencies regulate some
    aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in
    areas not otherwise regulated by federal law.

KCS’ subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state
    and local environmental regulations. These laws cover discharges
    to water, air emissions, toxic substances, and the generation,
    handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and
    hazardous materials. These regulations have the effect of
    increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail
    operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail
    operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and
    other hazardous materials.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican
    operations is overseen by the Secretary of Communications and
    Transportation (“SCT”). The SCT establishes
    regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and is
    responsible for resolving disputes between railways and between
    railways and customers. In addition, KCSM must register its
    maximum rates with the SCT and make regular reports to the SCT
    on investment and traffic volumes. See Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

“Description of the Business —

The KCSM
    Concession

.”

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the
    imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of
    operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or
    the termination of the Concession. KCS believes that facilities
    which it operates are in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental laws, regulations and agency agreements. KCS
    maintains environmental reserves which are believed by
    management to be appropriate with respect to known and existing
    environmental contamination of its properties which KCS may be
    responsible to remedy. In addition, KCS’s subsidiaries are
    party to contracts and other legally binding obligations by
    which previous owners of certain facilities now owned by KCS are
    responsible to remedy contamination of such sites remaining from
    their previous ownership. There are currently no material legal
    or administrative proceedings pending against the Company with
    respect to any environmental matters and management does not
    believe that continued compliance with environmental laws will
    have any material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition. KCS cannot predict the effect, if any, that
    unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional
    or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have
    on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial condition.

COMPETITION

The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are
    much larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources. The railroad industry is dominated by a few very
    large carriers. The larger western railroads (BNSF Railway
    Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are
    significant competitors of KCS because of their substantial
    resources and competitive routes. The ongoing impact of past and
    future rail consolidation is uncertain. However, KCS believes
    that its investments and strategic alliances continue to
    competitively position the Company to attract additional rail
    traffic throughout its rail network.

In November 2005, Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Ferromex”) acquired control of and merged with
    Ferrosur S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”), creating
    Mexico’s largest railway. These merged operations are much
    larger than KCSM, and they serve most of the major ports and
    cities in Mexico and together own fifty percent of FTVM, which
    serves industries located within Mexico City. The merger between
    Ferromex and Ferrosur has been rejected by the

Comisión
    Federal de Competencia

(Mexican Antitrust Commission, or
    “COFECO”). Both Ferromex and Ferrosur challenged
    COFECO’s decision.



The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge
    lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain
    routes in KCS’ operating areas. In the past, truck carriers
    have generally eroded the railroad industry’s share of
    total transportation revenues. Intermodal traffic and certain
    other traffic face highly price sensitive competition,
    particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers,
    including KCS, have placed an emphasis on competing in the
    intermodal marketplace and working with motor carriers to
    provide

end-to-end

transportation of products.

While deregulation of U.S. freight rates has enhanced the
    ability of railroads to compete with each other and with
    alternative modes of transportation, this increased competition
    has generally resulted in downward pressure on freight rates.
    Competition with other railroads and other modes of
    transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the
    quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality
    of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities.

EMPLOYEES
    AND LABOR RELATIONS

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
    to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures (which
    include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of
    presidential intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations
    with the various unions generally take place over an extended
    period of time and the Company rarely experiences work stoppages
    during negotiations. Wages, health and welfare benefits, work
    rules and other issues have traditionally been addressed during
    these negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carriers’ Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees has been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated in November of 2009. Long term
    settlement agreements were reached during 2007 and 2008 covering
    all of KCSR’s unionized work force through January 1,
    2010. The union labor negotiation has not historically resulted
    in any strike, boycott, or other disruption in the
    Company’s business operations. The Company does not believe
    the expected settlements will have a material impact to the
    consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997, between KCSM and the

Sindicato de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la
    República Mexicana

(Mexican Railroad Union), for a term
    of 50 years, for the purpose of regulating the relationship
    between the parties and improving conditions for the union
    employees. Approximately 80% of KCSM employees are covered by
    this labor agreement. The compensation terms under this labor
    agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and
    all other terms are subject to negotiation every two years. In
    June of 2009, the negotiation of the compensation terms and all
    other benefits was started with the Mexican Railroad Union. The
    union labor negotiation with the Mexican Railroad Union has not
    historically resulted in any strike, boycott, or other
    disruption in KCSM’s business operations. KCSM does not
    believe the expected settlements will have a material impact to
    the consolidated financial statements.

RAIL
    SECURITY

The Company and its rail subsidiaries have made a concentrated,
    multi-disciplinary effort since the terrorist attacks on the
    United States on September 11, 2001, to continue securing
    the Company’s assets and personnel against the risk of
    terrorism and other security risks. Many of the specific
    measures the Company utilizes for these efforts are required to
    be kept confidential through arrangements with government
    agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security
    (“DHS”), or through jointly-developed and implemented
    strategies and plans with connecting carriers. To protect the
    confidentiality and sensitivity of the efforts the Company has
    made to safeguard against terrorism and other security
    incidents, the following paragraphs will provide only a general
    overview of some of these efforts. KCSR and KCSM utilize a
    security plan based on an industry wide security plan developed
    by Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) members
    which focuses on comprehensive risk assessments in five
    areas — hazardous materials; train operations;
    critical physical assets; military traffic; and information
    technology and communications. The security plan is kept



confidential, with access to the plan tightly limited to members
    of management with direct security and anti-terrorism
    implementation responsibilities. KCSR and KCSM participate with
    other AAR members in periodic drills under the industry plan to
    test and refine its various provisions.

The Company’s security activities range from periodically
    mailing each employee a security awareness brochure (which is
    also posted under the “Employees” tab on the
    Company’s internet website, www.kcsouthern.com) to its
    ongoing development and implementation of security plans for
    rail facilities in areas labeled by the DHS as High Threat Urban
    Areas (“HTUAs”). The Company’s other activities
    to bolster security against terrorism include, but are not
    limited to, the following:

•

Conferring regularly with other railroads’ security
    personnel and with industry experts on security issues;

•

Analyzing routing alternatives and other strategies to reduce
    the distances that certain chemicals, which might be toxic if
    inhaled, are transported;

•

Initiating a series of over 20 voluntary action items agreed to
    between AAR and DHS as enhancing security in the rail
    industry; and

•

Including periodic security training as part of the scheduled
    training for operating employees and managers.

In addition, in 2008 the Company created a new leadership role
    titled “Director of Homeland Security” to oversee the
    ongoing and increasingly complex security efforts of the Company
    in both the United States and Mexico. The Company identified and
    retained an individual to fill the position who has an extensive
    law enforcement background, including being formerly employed as
    an analyst with the Federal Bureau of Investigation
    (“FBI”) for 12 years. This member of management
    remains a member of the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force
    and is a valuable asset to the Company in implementing and
    developing anti-terrorism and other security initiatives.

During 2008, KCSR worked toward implementation of DHS’s
    Transport Worker Identification Card program for those employees
    requiring unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities,
    and during 2009, began implementing a contractor background
    check program for contractor employees having access to certain
    Company facilities.

While the risk of theft and vandalism is higher in Mexico, KCSM
    remains among the safest transportation for freight shipments in
    Mexico. KCSM’s record in rail safety is due in large part
    to the implementation of a multi-layered, safety and security
    process throughout the KCSM network. In addition to having its
    own internal system of checks and balances, the process is
    connected to, and supported by a high level of federal, state
    and local law enforcement. A primary focus of this effort
    involves maintaining train velocity, which reduces the
    likelihood for incidents to occur. By moving customers’
    shipments more efficiently, KCSM is keeping the cargo secure.

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Related to an Investment in KCS’ Common Stock

The
    price of KCS’ common stock may fluctuate significantly,
    which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock
    when they want to or at prices they find
    attractive.

The price of KCS’ common stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange (“NYSE”), listed under the ticker symbol
    “KSU”, constantly changes. The Company expects that
    the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can fluctuate as a result of a
    variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCS’ control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

quarterly variations in operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management,
    securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts, ratings
    agencies and investors;

•

developments generally affecting the railroad industry;

•

announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant
    contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint
    ventures or capital commitments;

•

the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings
    against KCS;

•

KCS’ dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of
    dividends;

•

future sales of KCS’ equity or equity-linked securities;

•

the issuance of common stock in payment of dividends on
    preferred stock or upon conversion of preferred stock or
    convertible debt; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions including
    the availability of short- and long-term financing.

In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has
    experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to
    the operating performance of a particular company. These broad
    market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS’
    ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock is currently
    prohibited and KCS does not anticipate paying cash dividends on
    its common stock in the foreseeable future.

KCS has agreed, and may agree in the future, to restrictions on
    its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock. In
    addition, to maintain its credit ratings, the Company may be
    limited in its ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock
    so that it can maintain an appropriate level of debt. During the
    first quarter of 2000, the Board of Directors suspended common
    stock dividends. KCS does not anticipate making any cash
    dividend payments to its common stockholders in the foreseeable
    future.

Holders
    of the Series D Preferred Stock may have special voting
    rights if KCS fails to pay dividends on that preferred stock
    over a stated number of quarters.

If dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears
    for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number of days in
    the aggregate, whether or not consecutive), holders of the
    Series D Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two of
    the authorized number of directors at the next annual
    stockholders’ meeting at which directors are elected and at
    each subsequent stockholders’ meeting until such time as
    all accumulated dividends are paid on the Series D
    Preferred Stock or set aside for payment. In addition, so long
    as dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock remain unpaid
    and for a period thereafter, KCS will not be eligible to
    register future



offerings of securities on

Form S-3

or to avail itself of the other benefits available to companies
    that qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” under
    SEC rules, which could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    access capital markets and increase the cost of accessing
    capital markets.

Sales
    of substantial amounts of KCS’ common stock in the public
    market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the
    common stock.

As of December 31, 2009, there were 8,763,107 shares
    of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan,
    the 2008 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and the
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 2,117,095 shares of common
    stock held by executive officers and directors outside those
    plans, and 6,999,826 shares of common stock reserved for
    issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of
    convertible preferred stock. Sales of common stock by employees
    upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and
    directors subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act, and sales of common stock that may be issued
    upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the
    perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the
    market price of KCS’ common stock.

KCS
    has provisions in its charter, bylaws and Rights Agreement that
    could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a
    controlling interest in KCS and that could deprive an investor
    of an opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or
    prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties, including
    provisions providing for a classified board and supermajority
    stockholder approval requirements in order to increase the size
    of the board of directors, abolish cumulative voting, abolish
    the classification of the Board, or effect certain merger,
    consolidation or sale transactions. The bylaws provide that a
    stockholder must give the Company advance written notice of its
    intent to nominate a director or raise a matter at an annual
    meeting. In addition, the Company has adopted a Rights Agreement
    which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the
    ability of third parties to acquire control of KCS without prior
    approval of the Board of Directors. These provisions may deprive
    KCS’ stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at
    a premium over prevailing market prices.

The
    failure of a bank to fund a request (or any portion of such
    request) by KCS to borrow money under its existing revolving
    credit facility could reduce KCS’ ability to fund capital
    expenditures or otherwise properly fund its
    operations.

The Company and its subsidiaries are in an industry that
    requires continuing infrastructure improvements and acquisitions
    of capital assets, necessitating substantial expenditure of
    cash. KCSR has an existing revolving credit facility with
    multiple banking institutions to provide additional liquidity.
    If any of the banking institutions that are a party to such
    credit facility fails to fund a request (or any portion of such
    request) by KCSR to borrow money under its credit facility,
    KCS’ ability to fund capital expenditures, fund its
    operations and pay debt service could be reduced, each of which
    could result in a decline in the value of a stockholder’s
    investment in the Company.

The
    failure of any bank in which the Company deposits funds could
    reduce the amount of cash the Company has available to pay
    distributions and make additional investments.

Given the developments in the subprime mortgage and other
    financial markets, financial institutions have additional
    capital risks. The Company has diversified cash and cash
    equivalents among several banking institutions in an attempt to
    minimize exposure to any one of these entities. However, the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or “FDIC,” only
    insures amounts up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank.
    KCS currently has cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
    deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of
    federally insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in
    which KCS has deposited funds ultimately fails, the Company may
    lose its deposits to the extent they are in excess of $250,000.
    The loss of the Company’s deposits could reduce the amount
    of cash the Company has available to distribute or invest and
    could result in a decline in the value of each
    stockholder’s investment in the Company.



Risks
    Related to KCS’ Business

KCS
    competes against other railroads and other transportation
    providers.

The Company’s domestic and international operations are
    subject to competition from other railroads, particularly the
    Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) and BNSF Railway
    Company (“BNSF”) in the United States and Ferromex in
    Mexico, as well as from truck carriers, barge lines, and other
    maritime shippers. Many of KCS’ rail competitors are much
    larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources than KCS, which may enable rail competitors to reduce
    rates and make KCS’ freight services less competitive.
    KCS’ ability to respond to competitive pressures by
    matching rate reductions and decreasing rates without adversely
    affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on,
    among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs.
    KCS’ failure to respond to competitive pressures, and
    particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
    operation and financial condition.

The railroad industry is dominated by a few large carriers.
    These larger railroads could attempt to use their size and
    pricing power to block other railroads’ access to efficient
    gateways and routing options that are currently and have
    historically been available. In addition, if there is future
    consolidation in the railroad industry in the United States or
    Mexico, there can be no assurance that it will not have an
    adverse effect on operations.

Trucking, maritime, and barge competitors, while able to provide
    rate and service competition to the railroad industry, are able
    to use public

rights-of-way,

require substantially smaller capital investment and maintenance
    expenditures than railroads and allow for more frequent and
    flexible scheduling. Continuing competitive pressures, any
    reduction in margins due to competitive pressures, future
    improvements that increase the quality of alternative modes of
    transportation in the locations in which the Company operates,
    or legislation or regulations that provide motor carriers with
    additional advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and
    reduced weight restrictions, could result in downward pressure
    on freight rates, which in turn could have a material adverse
    effect on results of operations, financial condition and
    liquidity.

A central part of KCS’ growth strategy is based upon the
    conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance
    the Company will succeed in its efforts to convert traffic from
    truck to rail transport or that the customers already converted
    will be retained. If the railroad industry in general is unable
    to preserve its competitive advantages vis-à-vis the
    trucking industry, projected revenue growth could be adversely
    affected. Additionally, revenue growth could be affected by,
    among other factors, an expansion in the availability, or an
    improvement in the quality, of the trucking services offered by
    carriers resulting from regulatory and administrative
    interpretations and implementation of certain provisions of the
    North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), and
    KCS’ inability to grow its existing customer base and
    capture additional cargo transport market share because of
    competition from the shipping industry and other railroads.

KCS’
    business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on
    agreements with other railroads and third parties.

Operation of KCS’ rail network and its plans for growth and
    expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads
    and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic
    alliances, as well as interchange, trackage rights, haulage
    rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third
    parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage
    the Company does not own. KCS’ ability to provide
    comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large
    part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with other
    railroads and third parties. The termination of, or the failure
    to renew, these agreements could adversely affect KCS’
    business, financial condition and results of operations. KCS is
    also dependent in part upon the financial health and efficient
    performance of other railroads. For example, some of KCSR’s
    traffic moves over the UP’s lines via trackage rights, a
    significant portion of KCSR’s grain shipments originate
    with another rail carrier pursuant to marketing agreements with
    that carrier, and the UP is KCS’ largest partner in the
    interchange of total rail traffic. There can be no assurance
    that KCS will not be materially adversely affected by
    operational or financial difficulties of other railroads.



KCSM’s
    operations are subject to certain trackage rights, haulage
    rights and interline service agreements with another Mexican
    rail carrier, some of which are in dispute.

Through KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM
    is required to grant short and long distance trackage rights to
    Ferromex. Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex similarly is
    required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of their
    tracks. Although all of these trackage rights have been granted
    under the Concession, KCSM and Ferromex have not actually
    operated under the long distance trackage rights because, other
    than the rates to be charged pursuant to the Trackage Rights
    Agreement, dated February 9, 2010, between KCSM and
    Ferromex, the rates that may be charged for the right to use the
    tracks have not been agreed upon between KCSM and Ferromex for
    the periods beginning in 1998 through December 31, 2008.

If KCSM cannot reach an agreement with Ferromex for rates
    applicable for services prior to January 1, 2009 which are
    not subject to the Trackage Rights Agreement, the SCT is
    entitled to set the rates in accordance with Mexican law and
    regulations, which rates may not adequately compensate KCSM.
    KCSM is currently involved in judicial, civil and administrative
    proceedings and negotiations with Ferromex regarding the rates
    payable to each other for trackage rights, interline services
    and haulage rights for periods prior to January 1, 2009.
    Certain of these disputes continue under litigation. Any
    resolution of such procedures adverse to KCSM could have a
    negative impact on its results of operations in a particular
    quarter or fiscal year.

KCS’
    debt capitalization ratio (total debt as a percentage of total
    debt plus equity) is 45.8%. KCS’ leverage could adversely
    affect its ability to fulfill obligations under various debt
    instruments and operate its business.

KCS’ level of debt could make it more difficult for it to
    borrow money in the future, may reduce the amount of money
    available to finance operations and other business activities,
    exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates,
    makes it more vulnerable to general economic downturns and
    adverse industry conditions, and could reduce flexibility in
    planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic
    conditions. KCS’ failure to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants in its debt instruments, which,
    among other things, require KCS to maintain specified financial
    ratios and limit its ability to incur debt and sell assets,
    could result in an event of default that, if not cured or
    waived, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not
    have enough cash to service its debt, meet other obligations and
    fund other liquidity needs, KCS may be required to take actions
    such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying
    capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or
    refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking
    additional equity capital. KCS cannot assure that any of these
    remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at
    all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt
    agreements may restrict the Company from adopting some of these
    alternatives.

The indebtedness of KCSM exposes it to risks of exchange rate
    fluctuations because any devaluation of the peso would cause the
    cost of KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase and
    could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico,
    compared to Mexican competitors that have less

dollar-denominated

debt and greater operating and financial flexibility than KCSM.

A
    downturn in the debt capital markets may increase the cost of
    borrowing and make financing difficult to obtain, each of which
    may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results
    of operations and business.

Events in the financial markets may have an adverse impact on
    the debt capital markets and, as a result, credit may become
    more expensive and difficult to obtain. Lenders may impose more
    stringent restrictions on the terms of credit and there may be a
    general reduction in the amount of credit available in the
    markets in which KCS conducts business. The negative impact of
    tightening credit markets and adverse changes in the debt
    capital markets generally may have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business and results of operations resulting from, but
    not limited to, an inability to finance capital expansion on
    favorable terms, if at all, increased financing costs or
    financial terms with increasingly restrictive covenants.



KCS’
    business is capital intensive.

The Company’s business is capital intensive and requires
    substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things,
    additions and improvements to roadway, structures and
    technology, acquisitions, and maintenance and repair of
    equipment and the rail system. KCS’ failure to make
    necessary capital expenditures to maintain its operations could
    impair its ability to serve existing customers or accommodate
    increases in traffic volumes.

KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM
    fails to make such capital investments, KCSM’s business
    plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk,
    requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no
    assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by
    the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business
    plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not
    grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with
    the capital investment commitments in its business plan could
    result in sanctions imposed by the SCT, and could result in
    revocation of the Concession if sanctions are imposed on five
    distinct occasions. The Company cannot assure that the Mexican
    government would grant any such permission or waiver. If such
    permission or waiver is not obtained in any instance and KCSM is
    sanctioned, its Concession might be at risk of revocation, which
    would materially adversely affect KCS’ financial condition
    and results of operations. See “KCSM’s Mexican
    Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain
    circumstances” below.

KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund capital
    expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, equipment
    leases, and debt financing. KCS may not be able to generate
    sufficient cash flows from its operations or obtain sufficient
    funds from external sources to fund capital expenditure
    requirements. Even if financing is available, it may not be
    obtainable on acceptable terms and within the limitations
    contained in the indentures and other agreements relating to
    KCS’ existing debt.

KCS
    depends on the stability and availability of its information
    technology systems to operate its business.

KCS relies on information technology in all aspects of its
    business. A significant disruption or failure of its information
    technology systems, including its computer hardware, software
    and communications equipment, could result in service
    interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory
    compliance failures and the inability to protect corporate
    information assets against intruders or other operational
    difficulties. Although KCS has taken steps to mitigate these
    risks, a significant disruption could adversely affect KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and
    ability to compete effectively. Additionally, if KCS is unable
    to acquire or implement new technology, it may suffer a
    competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse
    effect on KCS’ results of operations, financial condition
    or liquidity.

KCS’
    business may be adversely affected by changes in general
    economic, weather or other conditions.

KCS’ operations may be adversely affected by changes in the
    economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that
    produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The
    relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican
    economies affect the businesses served by KCS. Prolonged
    negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or
    disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit
    markets, including the availability of short and long-term debt
    financing, may affect KCS, as well as the producers and
    consumers of the commodities that KCS transports and may have a
    material adverse effect on KCS’ results of operations,
    financial condition, and liquidity.

PCRC is directly affected by the world economy and trans-Pacific
    trade flows. In addition, KCS’ investments in Mexico and
    Panama expose the Company to risks associated with operating in
    Mexico and Panama, including, among others, cultural
    differences, varying labor, regulatory and operating practices,
    political risk and differences between the United States,
    Mexican and Panamanian economies. Historically, a stronger
    economy has resulted in improved results for KCS’ rail
    transportation operations. Conversely, when the economy has
    slowed, results have been less favorable. If an economic
    slowdown or recession occurs in key markets, the volume of rail
    shipments is likely to be reduced, which could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business and financial condition.



The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally
    tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although
    transportation markets are affected by general economic
    conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each
    particular market that may influence operating results. Some of
    KCS’ customers do business in industries that are highly
    cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive, housing and
    agriculture industries. Any downturn in these industries could
    have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also, some
    of the products transported have had a historical pattern of
    price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the
    general economic environment and by industry capacity and
    demand. For example, global steel and petrochemical prices have
    decreased in the past, and reduced demand for automotive
    vehicles and related shipments may result in decreased prices.
    KCS cannot assure that prices and demand for these products will
    not decline in the future, adversely affecting those industries
    and, in turn, the Company’s financial condition or results.

The Company’s operations may also be affected by natural
    disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in
    and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, and its
    facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and
    other extreme weather conditions that adversely affect KCS’
    shipping, agricultural, chemical and other customers. Many of
    the goods and commodities transported by KCS experience cyclical
    demand. KCS’ results of operations can be expected to
    reflect this cyclical demand because of the significant fixed
    costs inherent in railroad operations. Significant reductions in
    the volume of rail shipments due to economic, weather, or other
    conditions could have a material adverse effect on KCS’
    business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash
    flows.

KCS’
    business may be affected by market and regulatory responses to
    climate change.

KCS’ operations may be adversely affected by restrictions,
    caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases,
    including diesel exhaust. Restrictions on emissions could also
    affect KCS’ customers that use commodities that KCS
    transports to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy
    in producing or delivering the commodities KCS transports, or
    manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of
    energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants,
    chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers
    and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government
    regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or
    services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions
    reductions could materially affect the markets for the
    commodities KCS transports, which in turn could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ results of operations, financial
    condition and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the
    use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain
    customers and their respective markets for certain commodities
    KCS transports in an unpredictable manner that could alter
    traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol
    incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Any of these
    factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the
    other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business,
    results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

KCS is
    exposed to the credit risk of its customers and counterparties
    and their failure to meet their financial obligations could
    adversely affect KCS’ business.

KCS’ business is subject to credit risk including the risk
    that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its
    obligations when due. Customers and counterparties that owe the
    Company money may default on their obligations to the Company
    due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or
    other reasons. Although the Company has procedures for reviewing
    its receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and
    counterparties to address present credit concerns, default risk
    may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to
    detect or foresee. Some of the Company’s risk management
    methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding
    markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or
    otherwise accessible by the Company. That information may not,
    in all cases, be accurate, complete,

up-to-date

or properly evaluated. In addition, concerns about, or a default
    by, one customer or counterparty could lead to significant
    liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other customers or
    counterparties, which in turn could adversely affect the
    Company. The Company may be materially and adversely affected in
    the event of a significant default by its customers and
    counterparties.



KCS’
    business is subject to regulation by international, federal,
    state and local regulatory agencies, including tax,
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that
    could require KCS to incur material costs or liabilities
    relating to tax, environmental, health, or safety compliance or
    remediation. KCS’ failure to comply with these regulations
    could have a material adverse effect on its
    operations.

KCS is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based
    taxes, in both the United States and Mexico. Significant
    judgment is required in determining the provision for income
    taxes and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax rates, enactment
    of new tax laws, and revisions of tax regulations could have a
    material adverse affect on the Company’s financial
    condition and operating results. Although KCS believes the tax
    estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits,
    claims, or litigation could differ from what is reflected in
    KCS’ income tax provisions and accruals.

KCS is subject to governmental regulation by international,
    federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to its
    railroad operations, including the Department of Transportation
    and the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and
    the Secretary of Communications and Transportation in Mexico, as
    well as a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and
    other matters. Government regulation of the railroad industry is
    a significant determinant of the competitiveness and
    profitability of railroads. As part of the Rail Safety
    Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, Class I railroad
    carriers and passenger and commuter rail operators must
    implement positive train control (a technology designed to help
    prevent

train-to-train

collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work
    zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned)
    at certain locations (including main line track where toxic
    inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard movements occur or
    where passenger operations occur) by the end of 2015, which will
    add to operating costs, increase the number of employees the
    Company employs and require KCS to invest significant amounts of
    money into new safety technology. KCS’ inadvertent failure
    or inability to comply with applicable laws and regulations
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    liquidity and operations, including limitations on operating
    activities until compliance with applicable requirements is
    achieved. These government agencies may change the legislative
    or regulatory framework within which the Company operates
    without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on its
    business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally,
    some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain
    various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure
    to maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations
    could adversely affect KCS’ business.

From time to time, certain KCS facilities have not been in
    compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and
    regulations and there can be no assurance that KCS will always
    be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.
    Environmental liability under federal and state law in the
    United States can also extend to previously owned or operated
    properties, leased properties and properties owned by third
    parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by
    the Company. Environmental liabilities may also arise from
    claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties.
    Given the nature of its business, the Company incurs, and
    expects to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs,
    including, in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance
    with requirements governing chemical and hazardous material
    shipping operations, refueling operations and repair facilities.
    KCS presently has environmental investigation and remediation
    obligations at certain sites, and will likely incur such
    obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities
    accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s
    best estimate of the probable future obligation for the
    remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded
    liability is the best estimate of all probable costs,

clean-up

costs cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, and may
    exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving
    environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the
    extent of other parties’ participation, developments in
    environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective
    action that may ultimately be required. New laws and
    regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements,
    accidental spills, releases or violations or the discovery of
    previously unknown contamination could require KCS to incur
    costs or subject KCS to liabilities that could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business, results of operations,
    financial condition, and cash flows.

The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican
    federal and state laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment, including standards for, among
    other things, water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise
    pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling
    of hazardous and



solid waste. Under applicable Mexican law and regulations,
    administrative and criminal proceedings may be brought and
    economic sanctions imposed against companies that violate
    environmental laws, and non-complying facilities may be
    temporarily or permanently closed. KCSM is also subject to the
    laws of various jurisdictions and international conferences with
    respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and
    to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments
    of each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities
    are located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the
    Mexican government also impose environmental compliance
    obligations on KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if
    any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of
    additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations
    would have on KCSM’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial condition. Failure to comply with any environmental
    laws or regulations may result in the termination of KCSM’s
    Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect
    profitability.

KCS,
    as a common carrier by rail, is required by United States and
    Mexican laws to transport hazardous materials, which could
    expose KCS to significant costs and claims.

Under United States federal statutes and Mexican applicable
    laws, KCS’s common carrier responsibility requires it to
    transport hazardous materials. Any rail accident or other
    incident or accident on KCS’s network, facilities, or at
    the facilities of KCS’s customers involving the release of
    hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard (or TIH)
    materials, could involve significant costs and claims for
    personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties
    and remediation, which could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’s results of operations, financial condition, and
    liquidity.

KCS’
    business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and disruptions in
    fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the cost of fuel that
    is not adequately covered by fuel surcharges, or severe
    disruption of fuel supplies, would have a material adverse
    effect on KCS’ business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and
    these costs represent a significant portion of its
    transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel
    may have a material adverse effect on operating results. During
    periods of rising fuel prices, KCS has been able to pass the
    majority of these fuel cost increases on to customers in the
    form of fuel surcharges applied either in the form of an
    increase in the freight rate or direct customer billings. If KCS
    is unable to recapture its costs of fuel from its customers,
    operating results could be materially adversely affected. In
    addition, a severe disruption of fuel supplies resulting from
    supply shortages, political unrest, a disruption of oil imports,
    weather events, war, or otherwise, and the resulting impact on
    fuel prices could materially adversely affect KCS’
    operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel
    requirements for its Mexican operations almost exclusively
    through purchases at market prices from PEMEX Refinanción
    (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico, a
    government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the
    distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to
    a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration. Either
    party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written
    notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is
    terminated and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from
    alternate sources on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations
    could be materially adversely affected.

Market
    fluctuations could adversely impact KCS’s operating results
    as it hedges certain transactions.

From time to time, KCS may use various financial instruments to
    reduce its exposure to various market risks, including interest
    rates and fuel prices. While these financial instruments reduce
    the Company’s exposure to changes in market risks, the use
    of such instruments may ultimately limit the Company’s
    ability to benefit from lower fuel prices or interest rates due
    to amounts fixed at the time of entering into the hedge
    agreement.

The
    loss of key personnel could negatively affect
    business.

KCS’ success substantially depends on its ability to
    attract and retain key members of the senior management team and
    the principals of its foreign subsidiaries. Recruiting,
    motivating, and retaining qualified



management personnel, particularly those with expertise in the
    railroad industry, are vital to operations and success. There is
    substantial competition for qualified management personnel and
    there can be no assurance that KCS will always be able to
    attract or retain qualified personnel. Employment agreements
    with senior management are terminable at any time by either
    party. If KCS loses one or more of these key executives or
    principals, its ability to successfully implement its business
    plans and the value of its common stock could be materially
    adversely affected.

A
    majority of KCS’ employees belong to labor unions. Strikes
    or work stoppages could adversely affect
    operations.

The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with
    various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of
    December 31, 2009, approximately 80% of KCSR’s and
    KCSM’s employees were covered by labor contracts subject to
    collective bargaining. The Company may be subject to, among
    other things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a
    result of disputes under these collective bargaining agreements
    and labor contracts or KCS’ potential inability to
    negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United
    States, because such agreements are generally negotiated on an
    industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions
    of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond
    KCS’ control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and
    conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a
    material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows. If the unionized workers in the United
    States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or
    other slowdown, if other employees were to become unionized, or
    if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
    renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of
    its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the
    U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of
    United States railway workers to strike, there is no law in
    Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway
    workers in that country to strike.

KCS
    faces possible catastrophic loss and liability and its insurance
    may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages to
    others.

The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk
    of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision, and property
    loss. In the course of KCS’ operations, spills or other
    environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business
    interruption due to political developments, as well as labor
    disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result
    in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs.
    Collisions, environmental mishaps, or other accidents can cause
    serious bodily injury, death, and extensive property damage,
    particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated
    areas. Additionally, KCS’ operations may be affected from
    time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes,
    volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of
    a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ operations and financial condition. The Company
    maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice
    against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of
    its business and business interruption due to natural disaster.
    However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on
    coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against.
    This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCS’ damages
    or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be
    available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, KCS is
    subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become
    insolvent and would be unable to pay a claim that may be made in
    the future. Even with insurance, if any catastrophic
    interruption of service occurs, KCS may not be able to restore
    service without a significant interruption to operations which
    could have an adverse effect on KCS’ financial condition.

KCS’
    business may be affected by future acts of terrorism war or
    other acts of violence or crime.

Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s
    chemical transportation activities, any government response
    thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
    These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise
    capital or its future business opportunities. KCS’ rail
    lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect
    casualties of acts of terror, which could cause significant
    business interruption and damage to KCS’ property. In
    recent years, there have been



reported incidents of train cargo robberies in the United States
    and Mexico. Other acts of violence or crime could also adversely
    affect the Company’s business.

As a result, acts of terrorism or war or acts of crime or
    violence could result in increased costs and liabilities and
    decreased  revenues for KCS. In addition, insurance premiums
    charged for some or all of the applicable coverage currently
    maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or certain
    coverage may not be adequate to cover losses or may not be
    available in the future.

KCSM’s
    Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating
    its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s business and financial condition.

KCSM operates under the Concession granted by the Mexican
    government, which is renewable for up to 50 years, subject
    to certain conditions. The Concession gives KCSM exclusive
    rights to provide freight transportation services over its rail
    lines for 30 years of the

50-year

Concession, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights
    granted to other concessionaires. The SCT, which is principally
    responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, has
    broad powers to monitor KCSM’s compliance with the
    Concession and it can require KCSM to supply it with any
    technical, administrative and financial information it requests.
    Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment
    commitments established in its business plan, which forms an
    integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every
    five years. The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans
    confidentially. The SCT also monitors KCSM’s compliance
    with efficiency and safety standards established in the
    Concession. The SCT reviews, and may amend, these standards
    every five years.

The Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations provide the
    Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM
    under the Concession, including the right to take over the
    management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary
    cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the
    past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to
    other privatized industries, including the telecommunications
    industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In
    addition, under Article 47 of the Mexican Railroad Services
    Law and its regulations, the SCT, in consultation with the
    Mexican Antitrust Commission, reserves the right to set service
    rates if it determines that effective competition does not exist
    in the Mexican railroad industry. The Mexican Antitrust
    Commission, however, has not published guidelines regarding the
    factors that constitute a lack of competition. It is therefore
    unclear under what particular circumstances the Mexican
    Antitrust Commission would deem a lack of competition to exist.
    If the SCT intervenes and sets service rates, the rates it sets
    may be too low to allow KCSM to operate profitably.

Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail
    lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated
    structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the
    Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain
    assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. All
    other property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it
    for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will also have a right of first refusal with respect
    to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after revocation of the Concession.

The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of
    KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger
    to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may
    restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in such
    manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but
    only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican
    law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it
    effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public
    interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause
    other than international war, the Mexican Railroad Services Law
    and regulations provide that the Mexican government will
    indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to
    damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may
    not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not
    be timely made.



The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is sanctioned on three
    distinct occasions for unjustly interrupting the operation of
    its rail lines or for charging tariffs higher than the tariffs
    it has registered with the SCT. In addition, the SCT may revoke
    the Concession if, among other things, KCSM is sanctioned on
    five distinct occasions because KCSM restricts the ability of
    other Mexican rail operators to use its rail lines; KCSM fails
    to make payments for damages caused during the performance of
    services; KCSM fails to comply with any term or condition of the
    Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations or the Concession;
    KCSM fails to make the capital investments required under its
    five-year business plan filed with the SCT; or KCSM fails to
    maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage
    as specified in the Mexican Railroad Services Law and
    regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke
    automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or
    creates any lien on the Concession, or if there is a change in
    control of KCSM without the SCT’s approval. The SCT may
    also terminate the Concession as a result of KCSM’s
    surrender of its rights under the Concession, or for reasons of
    public interest or upon KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy.
    Revocation or termination of the Concession would prevent KCSM
    from operating its railroad and would materially adversely
    affect the Mexican operations and the ability to make payments
    on KCSM’s debt. If the Concession is terminated or revoked
    by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no compensation
    and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures
    covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by
    it, would revert to the Mexican government.

In April 2006, the SCT initiated proceedings against KCSM,
    claiming that KCSM had failed to make certain minimum capital
    investments projected for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year
    business plan filed with the SCT prior to its April 2005
    acquisition by KCS (collectively, the “Capital Investment
    Proceedings”). KCSM believes it made capital expenditures
    exceeding the required amounts. KCSM responded to the SCT by
    providing evidence in support of its investments and explaining
    why it believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May 2007, KCSM
    was served with an SCT resolution regarding the Capital
    Investment Proceeding for 2004, in which the SCT resolved to
    impose no sanction. In June 2007, KCSM was served with an SCT
    resolution regarding the Capital Investment Proceeding for 2005,
    in which the SCT determined that KCSM had indeed failed to make
    the minimum capital investments required for such year, and
    imposed a minimal fine. KCSM has filed an action in the Mexican
    Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court challenging this ruling.
    KCSM will have the right to challenge any adverse ruling.

KCSM believes that even if a sanction is ultimately imposed as a
    consequence of the 2005 Capital Investment Proceeding, there
    will be no material adverse effect on its results of operations
    or financial condition. However, if a sanction were to be
    imposed, it would be considered a “generic” sanction
    under Mexican law (i.e., sanctions applied to conduct not
    specifically referred to in specific subsections of the Mexican
    railway law). If KCSM is ultimately sanctioned by the SCT for
    “generic” sanctions on five occasions over the term of
    the Concession, KCSM could be subject to possible future SCT
    action seeking revocation of the Concession. Such revocation
    would materially adversely affect the results of operations and
    financial condition of KCSM.

KCS’
    ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to
    economic and political risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise,
    significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly,
    Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and
    state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on
    Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSM’s
    Mexican operations in particular. KCS cannot predict the impact
    that the political landscape, including the recently implemented
    multiparty rule, will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore,
    KCSM’s financial condition, results of operations and
    prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation,
    interest rates, regulation, taxation, social instability and
    other political, social and economic developments in or
    affecting Mexico.

The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment
    deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. Although
    Mexico has imposed foreign exchange controls in the past, there
    are currently no exchange controls in Mexico. Pursuant to the
    provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of
    payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the
    future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange
    controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by
    United States and



Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange control policy
    could adversely affect KCS’ ability to obtain dollars or to
    convert pesos into dollars for purposes of making interest and
    principal payments due on indebtedness, to the extent KCS may
    have to effect those conversions, and could adversely affect the
    Company’s investment in KCSM. This could have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business and financial condition.

Mexican national politicians are currently focused on certain
    regional, political and social tensions, and reforms regarding
    fiscal and labor policies, gas, electricity, social security,
    and oil have not been and may not be approved. The social and
    political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican
    economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business, financial condition, and results of
    operation.

Downturns
    in the United States economy or in trade between the United
    States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar
    exchange rate would likely have adverse effects on KCS’
    business and results of operations.

The level and timing of KCS’ Mexican business activity is
    heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican
    trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican
    operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for
    the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico
    and the United States in these markets at any given time, and
    tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the
    United States or Mexican economy or in trade between the
    United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on
    KCS’ business results of operations and the Company’s
    ability to meet debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has
    invested significant amounts in developing its intermodal
    operations at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, in part to provide
    Asian importers with an alternative to the west coast ports of
    the United States, and the level of intermodal traffic depends,
    to an extent, on the volume of Asian shipments routed through
    Lazaro Cardenas. Reduction in trading volumes, which may be
    caused by factors beyond KCS’ control, including increased
    government regulations in light of recent concerns regarding the
    safety and quality of Asian-manufactured products, may adversely
    affect KCS’ business and results of operations.

Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates could lead
    to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and
    exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of
    the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be
    offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities
    KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase
    might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future
    developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the
    Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight
    volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and
    commodities KCSM carries.

Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of
    KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely
    affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness.
    Severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may result in
    disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may
    limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of
    interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness.
    Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and
    for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of
    Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of
    Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute
    restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability
    to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other
    currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the
    U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments.
    Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the
    U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar
    prices for KCS’ securities. Currency fluctuations are
    likely to continue to have an effect on KCS’ financial
    condition in future periods.

Mexico
    may experience high levels of inflation in the future which
    could adversely affect KCS’ results of
    operations.

Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation and may
    experience high inflation in the future. During most of the
    1980s and during the mid and late 1990s, Mexico experienced
    periods of high levels of inflation. The annual rates of
    inflation for the last three years, as measured by changes in
    the National Consumer Price Index, as provided by Banco de
    México, were 3.6% in 2009, 6.5% in 2008 and 3.8% in 2007. A
    substantial



increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have the effect of
    increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could adversely
    affect its results of operations and financial condition. High
    levels of inflation may also affect the balance of trade between
    Mexico and the United States, and other countries, which could
    adversely affect KCSM’s results of operations.

Risk
    Factors Relating to Ongoing Litigation

KCS is party to various legal proceedings and administrative
    actions arising in the ordinary course of business including
    those specifically mentioned below:

KCSM
    was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, which if adversely
    resolved, could result in KCS being ordered to return the stock
    of KCSM to the Federal Government of Mexico, thus losing its
    Concession to operate its Mexican railroad.

On December 9, 2009, KCSM was notified of a lawsuit filed
    by Minera México, S.A. de C.V. (“Minera
    México”), a subsidiary of Grupo México, S.A.B. de
    C.V. and an affiliate of Ferromex, against the Federal
    Government of Mexico, the SCT, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de
    México (“FNM”), KCSM, Nafta Rail, S.A. de C.V., a
    subsidiary of KCS (“Nafta Rail”), and KCS. The lawsuit
    claims that after the privatization bidding process for the
    acquisition of a majority interest in Ferrocarril del Noreste,
    S.A. de C.V. (“FNE”) (now KCSM) had concluded in 1997,
    in which the bidding was awarded to Transportación
    Ferroviaria Mexicana, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“TFM”) and
    the relevant stock purchase agreement was signed, the defendants
    improperly amended the stock purchase agreement and the
    purchasers paid a price lower than the price offered. The
    lawsuit alleges that the Mexican Federal Government, the SCT,
    FNM, KCSM, Nafta Rail and KCS violated a variety of the rules
    and regulations associated with the privatization bidding
    process. As a result of these alleged improprieties, Minera
    México claims the acquisition of FNE by KCS (through TFM)
    should be declared null and void and, consequently, the capital
    stock of FNE should be returned to the Federal Government of
    Mexico and Minera México, as the second place bidder in the
    bidding process, should be awarded the right to purchase the
    capital stock of FNE. On February 9, 2010, Minera
    México agreed to dismiss this lawsuit.

KCSM
    is involved in several disputes related to providing service to
    a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. auto manufacturer, which if
    adversely resolved could have a negative impact on its business
    and operations.

In March 2008, a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. Auto
    Manufacturer (the “Auto Manufacturer”) filed an
    arbitration suit against KCSM under a contract for services to
    the Auto Manufacturer’s plants in Mexico, which, as
    amended, had a stated termination date of January 31, 2008.
    The Auto Manufacturer claimed that the contract was implicitly
    extended and continued in effect beyond its stated termination
    date. The Auto Manufacturer is seeking a declaration by the
    arbitrator that the rates being assessed by KCSM are
    discriminatory, even though the rates being charged are within
    the legal rate limits set by Mexican law for such freight
    transportation. KCSM claimed that the contract did in fact
    expire on its stated termination date, and that services
    rendered thereafter are thus subject to the general terms and
    conditions (including rates) applicable in the absence of a
    specific contract, pursuant to Mexican law. Accordingly, KCSM
    filed a counterclaim against the Auto Manufacturer to, among
    other things, recover the applicable rate difference between the
    rates under the contract and KCSM’s rates. On May 18,
    2009, the arbitrator issued an award on the first phase of the
    arbitration proceeding, ruling that the contract had terminated
    on May 8, 2008. As of the date of this filing, the second
    phase of the arbitration proceeding, regarding the claim that
    the rates assessed by KCSM are discriminatory, is in the
    evidentiary stage and has not been resolved. Management believes
    the final resolution of these claims will not have any material
    impact on KCSM’s results of operations.

In May 2008, the SCT initiated a proceeding against KCSM at the
    request of the Auto Manufacturer, alleging that KCSM
    impermissibly bundled international rail services and engaged in
    discriminatory pricing practices with respect to rail services
    provided by KCSM to the Auto Manufacturer. In March 2009, the
    SCT issued a decision determining that KCSM had engaged in the
    activities alleged, but imposed no sanction since



this was the first time KCSM had engaged in such activities. On
    May 6, 2009, KCSM challenged the SCT’s decision and
    the appeal is currently pending in the Administrative and Fiscal
    Federal Court.

On July 23, 2008, the SCT delivered notice to KCSM of new
    proceedings against KCSM, claiming, among other things, that
    KCSM refused to grant Ferromex access to certain trackage over
    which Ferromex alleges it has trackage rights on six different
    occasions and thus denied Ferromex the ability to provide
    service to the Auto Manufacturer at this location.

KCSM believes it has defenses to the imposition of sanctions for
    the forgoing proceedings and is vigorously contesting these
    allegations. KCSM does not believe that these SCT proceedings
    will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
    or financial condition. However, if KCSM is ultimately
    sanctioned by the SCT for “generic” sanctions on five
    occasions over the term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject
    to possible future SCT action seeking revocation of the
    Concession. Revocation of the Concession would materially
    adversely affect KCSM’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

Properties

Track
    Configuration

KCSR operates over a railroad system consisting of approximately
    3,300 miles of main and branch lines in ten states
    extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United
    States south to the Mexican border. Approximately 400 miles
    of KCSR’s system consists of trackage rights that permit
    KCSR to operate its trains with its crews over other
    railroad’s tracks.

Under its Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM has the
    right to operate approximately 2,600 miles of main and
    branch lines, but does not own the land, roadway, or associated
    structures and has approximately 700 miles of trackage
    rights. The Concession requires KCSM to make investments as
    described in a business plan filed every five years with the
    Mexican government. KCSM may defer capital expenditures with
    respect to its five-year business plan with the permission of
    the SCT. However, should the SCT not grant this permission,
    KCSM’s failure to comply with the commitments in its
    business plan could result in fines and ultimately the Mexican
    government revoking the Concession. See Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors — KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to
    revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would
    prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business and
    financial condition.”

Market
    for KCS’ Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market
    Information

The Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the ticker symbol “KSU”. Information as
    to the high and low sales price of the Company’s common and
    preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008 is set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K

and is incorporated by reference herein.

Dividend
    Policy

Common Stock.

KCS has not declared any cash
    dividends on its common stock during the last five fiscal years
    and it does not anticipate making any cash dividend payments to
    common shareholders in the foreseeable future. Pursuant to
    KCSR’s credit agreement, KCS is prohibited from the payment
    of cash dividends on its common stock.

Preferred Stock.

Kansas City Southern is
    restricted from paying cash dividends on its Series D
    Preferred Stock when its coverage ratio (as defined in the
    indentures for KCSR’s 8.0% Senior Notes and
    13.0% Senior Notes) is less than 2.0:1. It is the
    Company’s intention to pay timely dividends on all
    preferred stock in cash when dividend payments are not
    restricted under the covenants of its various debt agreements
    and the Company has adequate levels of liquidity. In the event
    that dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are in
    arrears for six consecutive quarters (or an equivalent number of
    days in the aggregate, whether or not consecutive), holders of
    the Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, will be
    entitled to elect two of the authorized number of directors at
    the next annual stockholders’ meeting, and at each
    subsequent stockholders’ meeting until such time as all
    accumulated dividends are paid on the Series D Preferred
    Stock, as applicable, or set aside for payment.

Holders

There were 4,446 record holders of KCS common stock on
    February 4, 2010; however, the number of actual holders of
    KCS common stock is greater due to the practice of brokerage
    firms registering many shares for clients in the brokerage
    firm’s name.

    Plans

See Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of
    Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
    Matters” for information about securities authorized for
    issuance under KCS’ equity compensation plans.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

    Financial Overview

This has been a pivotal year for Kansas City Southern. With the
    uncertain state of the world economy, KCS, like so many other
    companies, has had to make difficult decisions about where to
    invest valuable resources for growth in the future. The Company
    has remained focused on maximizing the value of the cross border
    network and the vision to be a strong, independent
    transportation company that consistently delivers exceptional
    service to its customers and increasing value to its
    shareholders. Management believes the Company’s efforts
    leave it well positioned as the global economy begins to recover.

The Company reported 2009 earnings of $0.61 per diluted share on
    consolidated net income of $68.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to annual earnings of $1.86 per
    diluted share on consolidated net income of $183.9 million
    for 2008. This earnings decline reflects a 20% reduction in



revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008. This significant revenue
    decline was primarily driven by the economic downturn that has
    affected most business sectors, and has resulted in
    industry-wide declines in carload/unit volumes. The revenue
    declines were partially offset by reduced fuel costs, reflecting
    reduced consumption and prices, and increased efficiency. The
    revenue declines were further mitigated by the Company’s
    cost containment measures including modifications to the
    Company’s operations in response to volumes; however, due
    to increased depreciation and amortization expense and because
    certain operating costs are fixed in the short-term, operating
    expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 81.9% in 2009,
    as compared to 78.9% in 2008.

Cash flows from operations decreased to $292.9 million as
    compared to $413.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease is
    primarily due to lower carload/unit volumes as previously
    discussed. Capital expenditures are a significant use of cash
    for KCS and were $349.2 million for 2009, a 35% decrease
    compared to 2008. Despite the downturn in the economy, the
    Company continued to focus on the completion of strategic
    projects. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company
    completed construction and opened the newly rehabilitated line
    from Rosenberg to Victoria, Texas which diverts KCSR’s
    operations from 157 miles of trackage rights to a more
    direct route, reducing the mileage between Laredo and
    Houston/Beaumont by 67 miles. In addition, the line
    reopened regular train service to the area, bringing needed rail
    capacity to south Texas to reduce highway congestion and the
    number of trucks on Texas highways. It also makes regional
    business more competitive, leading to future growth and jobs.

During 2009, the Company was focused on improving KCS’
    financial condition and liquidity position. KCSM paid off its
    bank term loan and revolver using the proceeds of a
    $200.0 million debt offering in the first quarter. KCS also
    strengthened its balance sheet and liquidity through the sale of
    4,330,208 shares of common stock with net proceeds of
    $73.9 million.

Freight revenues include both revenue for transportation
    services and fuel surcharges. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, revenues decreased $371.9 million
    compared to the prior year, primarily due to the overall
    decrease in carload/unit volumes resulting from the downturn in
    the economy, decreased fuel surcharge, and the effect of
    unfavorable fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar
    against the value of the Mexican peso for revenues denominated
    in Mexican pesos, partially offset by an increase in core
    pricing. Revenue per carload/unit decreased by 11% for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, reflecting unfavorable commodity
    mix in addition to the factors discussed above.

KCS’s fuel surcharge is a mechanism to adjust revenue based
    upon changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharges are calculated
    differently depending on the type of commodity transported. For
    most commodities, fuel surcharge is calculated using a fuel
    price from a prior time period that can be as much as
    60 days earlier. In a period of volatile fuel prices or
    changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel
    surcharge may significantly differ.



The following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by
    commodity group:

Revenues by commodity

group for 2009

Chemical and
    petroleum.

Revenues decreased $24.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a
    decline in the fuel surcharge and unfavorable fluctuations in
    the value of the U.S. dollar against the value of the Mexican
    peso. Revenues decreased in chemical products used to
    manufacture glass and paint as a result of the downturn in the
    automotive and construction industries. Petroleum products also
    declined year over year due to an unfavorable customer mix,
    partially offset by an increase in volumes.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues
    decreased $164.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, due to decreases in volume, fuel
    surcharge and unfavorable fluctuations in the value of the U.S.
    dollar against the value of the Mexican peso. Volumes in metals
    and scrap decreased as a result of weak demand for pipe used in
    oil drilling and slab shipments used in automobiles and
    appliances. Forest products were affected by decreased demand
    that resulted in temporary mill shutdowns to bring inventory in
    line with demand.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues decreased
    $95.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    due to decreases in volume, fuel surcharge and unfavorable
    fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against the value
    of the Mexican peso. Grain traffic accounted for the majority of
    the decrease as traffic patterns shifted due to a combination of
    factors. There was an abundant supply of grain, primarily corn
    that was grown in Mexico, as well as an abundant supply of
    alternative grains which drove a change in origination and
    traffic patterns. In addition, significantly lower vessel
    freight rates from U.S. ports along the Gulf of Mexico drove a
    substitution from rail to vessel for certain shipments to
    Mexico. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in food
    products revenue driven by new business.

Coal.

Revenues decreased $16.5 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to a
    reduction in fuel surcharge and a decline in petroleum coke
    shipments going to the cement and steel industry markets in
    Mexico, which continue to be affected by the decline in
    construction projects. Unit coal volumes to existing electric
    generation customers increased during 2009; however, related
    revenue per unit declined primarily due to a reduction in fuel
    surcharge.

Intermodal.

Revenues decreased
    $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    primarily due to a decline in the fuel surcharge and an
    unfavorable change in product mix. The decrease in volume is due
    to the loss of business driven by unfavorable fluctuations in
    the value of the U.S. dollar against the value of the
    Mexican peso, reduced demand in consumer retail, and aggressive
    truck competition. The volume reduction was partially offset by
    an increase in haulage business and a fourth quarter increase in
    cross border automotive parts shipments.

Automotive.

Revenues decreased
    $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    due to a decline in volume and unfavorable fluctuations in the
    value of the U.S. dollar against the value of the Mexican
    peso. The volume decrease was driven by the continued overall
    downturn in the automotive industry caused by consumer
    uncertainty and tightening credit markets. In addition, the
    bankruptcy of two U.S. automotive companies resulted in
    several unscheduled plant shutdowns in the first half of 2009.
    The decline in volume was partially offset by government
    incentive programs that were established during the second and
    third quarters of 2009.



Operating
    expenses

Operating expenses, as shown below (

in millions

),
    decreased $249.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, when compared to the same period in
    2008, primarily due to decreased carload/unit volumes, fuel
    expense, cost containment measures and the effect of favorable
    fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
    value of the Mexican peso for operating expenses denominated in
    Mexican pesos. Certain prior period amounts have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits decreased $41.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to labor
    reductions in response to declining carload/unit volumes, with
    further expense decreases in Mexico due to favorable
    fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
    value of the Mexican peso.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    decreased $37.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to lower
    locomotive maintenance expense as a result of fewer locomotives
    in service, newer fleet and renegotiated maintenance contracts.
    Corporate expenses decreased as a result of cost containment
    measures. In addition, the Company recognized a deferred credit
    of $6.1 million related to the partial cancellation of a
    maintenance contract in 2009.

Fuel.

Fuel expense decreased
    $135.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to 2008, primarily due to lower diesel fuel prices,
    lower consumption driven by decreased carload/unit volumes, and
    increased fuel efficiency.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs decreased
    $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in the use of other
    railroads’ freight cars.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization increased $13.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to a
    larger asset base, partially offset by the impact of lower rates
    based on the scheduled depreciation study in 2009 and a change
    in the estimated useful lives of certain Mexico concession
    assets.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expenses decreased $29.6 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to
    fewer derailments and lower average cost per derailment. In
    addition, the Company reduced the personal injury reserve,
    reflecting favorable claims experience.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    decreased $5.6 million for year ended December 31,
    2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to lower employee expenses
    and lower materials and supplies used for the maintenance of
    track and locomotives. The decrease was partially offset by
    legal settlements in 2009. In addition, 2008 included a
    reduction of a legal reserve.



Non-Operating
    Expenses

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $7.7 million and
    $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Significant components of this change
    were as follows:

•

Equity in earnings from the operations of PCRC was
    $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to $8.2 million for 2008. The decrease is
    primarily due to a reduction in container volume attributable to
    the downturn in the economy.

•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $3.5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
    $5.1 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the
    loss on sale of railcars and other equipment in 2009, lower
    lease income due to lease expirations and larger casualties
    expense recorded in 2009.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $1.3 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to
    $4.7 million for 2008. The decrease is primarily due to the
    decline in volume due to the downturn in the Mexican economy and
    a favorable adjustment related to negotiations of a maintenance
    agreement recorded in 2008.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased
    $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    compared to 2008, primarily due to higher debt balances and
    average interest rates. In 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded
    interest expense reductions as a result of various tax-related
    settlements and in 2009 recognized interest expense from an
    unfavorable outcome related to a legal dispute.

Debt Retirement Costs.

Debt retirement costs
    increased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. In
    January 2009, KCSR redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due June 15, 2009 and expensed $5.3 million for
    cash tender offer expenses and unamortized debt issuance costs.
    In addition, in March of 2009, KCSM repaid all amounts
    outstanding under the 2007 KCSM Credit Agreement and upon
    termination, wrote-off the unamortized debt issuance cost
    related to this debt. In May 2008, KCSR redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due October 1, 2008 and expensed $5.6 million
    for cash tender offer expenses and unamortized debt issuance
    costs.

Foreign Exchange.

For the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the foreign exchange was a gain
    of $2.1 million and a loss of $21.0 million,
    respectively, primarily due to fluctuations in the value of the
    U.S. dollar versus the value of the Mexican peso.

Other Income, net.

Other income, net,
    decreased $0.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2009 compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to
    decreases in royalty, interest and dividend income, partially
    offset by gains on sale of property.

Income Tax Expense.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s income tax expense
    was $34.6 million, a decrease of $29.9 million as
    compared to $64.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate was 33.4% and
    25.9% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The changes in income tax expense and the
    effective tax rate were due to lower pre-tax income in 2009, a
    shift in the composition of income in different taxing
    jurisdictions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and a change
    in Mexican tax rates for tax years 2010 through 2013.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, revenues increased
    $109.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to
    targeted rate increases, increased fuel surcharge, and new
    business opportunities partially offset by an overall decrease
    in carload/unit volumes. A large portion of the volume decrease
    in 2008 was



realized in the fourth quarter resulting from the downturn in
    the economy. The effect of fluctuations in the value of the
    U.S. dollar against the value of the Mexican peso was not
    significant for the year ended December 31, 2008.

KCS’s fuel surcharge is a mechanism to adjust revenue based
    upon changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharges are calculated
    differently depending on the type of commodity transported. For
    most commodities, fuel surcharge is calculated using a fuel
    price from a prior time period that can be as much as
    60 days earlier. In a period of volatile fuel prices or
    changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel
    surcharge may significantly differ.

The following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by
    commodity group.

Revenues by commodity

group for 2008

Chemical and
    petroleum.

Revenues increased $27.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to targeted rate
    increases, fuel surcharge increases, and increased traffic
    volumes from new business primarily in plastic products.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues
    increased $7.5 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 primarily due to higher demand in the metals and scrap from
    coil and pipe products as well as new business, targeted rate
    increases, and fuel surcharge increases. These increases were
    partially offset by decreases in volume due to the declining
    housing market which impacted forest products and declines in
    beer export volume from Mexico reflected in other products due
    to a large beer producer relocating to an area not served by the
    KCS network in the first quarter of 2008.

Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased
    $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    driven by targeted rate increases, fuel surcharge increases and
    increased length of haul of cross border traffic from customers
    moving their business from various competitors onto the KCS
    network. Grain accounted for the majority of the revenue
    increase even with a

later-than-forecasted

harvest decreasing volume. This volume decrease was partially
    offset by increased traffic in ores and minerals, particularly
    in rock and sand products, due to the strong energy sector.

Coal.

Revenues increased $10.7 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, due to an increase in
    fuel surcharge participation, increased length of haul, rate
    increases, and improved system velocity on coal trains in the
    second half of 2008. The increase was partially offset by lower
    volumes during the first half of 2008 due to higher stockpile
    levels, utility customer maintenance outages, and adverse
    weather in the Midwest affecting deliveries.

Intermodal.

Revenues increased
    $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    driven by targeted rate increases and fuel surcharge increases.
    Volumes of imports and exports of intermodal containerized
    business originating and terminating at the Port of Lazaro
    Cardenas increased and were offset by decreases in automotive
    related traffic (parts distribution) as well as certain haulage
    business.

Automotive.

Revenues decreased
    $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Decreases were driven by the overall downturn in the automotive
    industry as higher cost of fuel and tightening credit markets
    have automobile manufacturers re-tooling factories to build more
    fuel efficient vehicles as well as developing programs to incent
    the purchase of new cars. The overall decrease was partially
    offset by targeted rate increases and new longer haul traffic in
    the first half of 2008.



Operating
    expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2008, operating expenses
    increased $81.5 million. The effect of fluctuations in the
    value of the U.S. dollar against the value of the Mexican
    peso was not significant for the year ended December 31,
    2008. The following summarizes the Company’s operating
    expenses

(in millions).

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits decreased $14.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. Increases due to
    annual wage and salary rate increases and severance obligations
    were offset by lower share-based compensation expense as a
    result of forfeitures, decreases in incentive compensation and
    an increase in capitalized overhead rates based on updated
    studies.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    increased $10.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to an
    increase in locomotive maintenance expense in Mexico, equipment
    and track structure maintenance expenses, corporate expenses and
    switching costs.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007, primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices,
    partially offset by lower consumption in certain parts of the
    network and increased fuel efficiency driven primarily by older
    locomotives being replaced with new locomotives through a
    strategic initiative in 2007 and 2008.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs decreased
    $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to 2007, due to a decrease in the use of other
    railroads’ freight cars.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization increased $9.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to a
    larger asset base.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expenses increased $3.4 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to
    the lower expense in 2007 from a favorable reinsurance
    litigation settlement received in the second quarter of 2007,
    and damages caused by the hurricanes in the third quarter of
    2008, partially offset by decreases in personal injury and
    derailment expenses.

Materials and other.

Materials and other
    increased $23.5 million for year ended December 31,
    2008, compared to 2007, due to increased materials and supplies
    used for the maintenance of freight cars and locomotives and
    lower sales and use tax in the first quarter of 2007 as a result
    of a favorable tax ruling.

Non-Operating
    Expenses

Equity in Net Earnings of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $18.0 million and
    $11.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Significant components of this change
    were as follows:

•

Equity in earnings from the operations of PCRC was
    $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to $3.7 million in 2007. The increase is primarily
    due to increased freight revenue driven by higher volume from
    new and existing customers.



•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $5.1 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
    $4.8 million in 2007. The increase is primarily attributed
    to increased lease income as well as a reduction in interest and
    administrative expenses.

•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $4.7 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
    $2.9 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects
    reduced maintenance expense in 2008 and a non-recurring prior
    year loss recorded in 2007.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense decreased
    $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower
    interest rates related to debt refinancing as well as lower
    accrued interest for various tax related matters as a result of
    certain settlements in the second quarter of 2008.

Debt Retirement Costs.

Debt retirement costs
    decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In May
    2008, KCSR redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due October 1, 2008 and expensed $5.6 million
    for cash tender offer expenses and unamortized debt issuance
    costs. In June of 2007, KCSM redeemed its


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2012 and entered into a new bank credit agreement. The
    charge of $16.7 million for the call premium and the
    write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the
    extinguished debt was partially offset by the $9.8 million
    write off of the unamortized purchase accounting fair value
    effect related to the


/


% Senior
    Notes.

Foreign Exchange.

For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the foreign exchange loss was
    $21.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively,
    primarily due to fluctuations in the value of the
    U.S. dollar versus Mexican peso exchange rates and a
    cumulative post-acquisition loss of $2.9 million in the
    fourth quarter, which was an

out-of-period

adjustment related to certain unsettled transactions recorded
    prior to 2004.

Other Income, net.

Other income, net,
    decreased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 compared to the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower
    interest and dividend income, and fewer gains on sales of land
    in 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007.

Income Tax Expense.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s income tax expense
    was $64.5 million, a decrease of $2.6 million as
    compared to $67.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The effective tax rate was 25.9% and
    30.3% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The reduction in the

year-over-year

effective rate reflects changes in foreign exchange rates
    partially offset by a tax asset valuation allowance recorded by
    KCSM during 2008.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

KCS’ primary uses of cash are to support operations;
    maintain and improve its railroad; pay debt service and
    preferred stock dividends; acquire new and maintain existing
    locomotives, rolling stock and other equipment; and meet other
    obligations. KCS’ cash flow from operations has
    historically been sufficient to fund operations, maintenance
    capital expenditures and debt service. External sources of cash
    (principally bank debt, public and private debt, preferred stock
    and leases) have been used to refinance existing indebtedness
    and to fund acquisitions, new investments and equipment
    additions. Due to the downturn in the economy and the timing of
    debt refinancing activities, the Company utilized
    $112.4 million of cash and cash equivalents during the year
    ended December 31, 2009 — see “Cash Flow
    Information” below. On December 31, 2009, total
    available liquidity (the unrestricted cash balance plus
    revolving credit facility availability) was approximately
    $203 million.

The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash
    and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt
    and equity capital markets, and other available financing
    resources will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating,
    capital and debt service requirements and other commitments in
    the foreseeable future. The Company intends to repay the
    outstanding balance of $40.0 million under the KCSR
    revolving credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity date
    of April 28, 2011. KCS has no significant scheduled debt
    maturities until 2012.



As of December 31, 2009, KCS has a debt capitalization
    ratio (total debt as a percentage of total debt plus total
    equity) of 45.8 percent. Its primary sources of liquidity
    are cash flows generated from operations, borrowings under its
    revolving credit facility and access to debt and equity capital
    markets. Although KCS has had adequate access to the capital
    markets, as a non-investment grade company, the financial terms
    under which funding is obtained often contain restrictive
    covenants. The covenants constrain financial flexibility by
    restricting or prohibiting certain actions, including the
    ability to incur additional debt for any purpose other than
    refinancing existing debt, create or suffer to exist additional
    liens, make prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends on
    common stock, make investments, engage in transactions with
    stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain
    assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations or in sale
    leaseback transactions. These restrictions, however, are subject
    to a number of qualifications and exceptions that provide the
    Company with varying levels of additional borrowing capacity.
    The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as
    of December 31, 2009.

KCS’ operating results and financing alternatives can be
    unexpectedly impacted by various factors, some of which are
    outside of its control. For example, if KCS was to experience a
    reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating
    costs or other liabilities, its earnings could be significantly
    reduced, increasing the risk of non-compliance with debt
    covenants. Additionally, the Company is subject to economic
    factors surrounding debt and equity capital markets and its
    ability to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to
    market conditions. Volatility in capital markets and the
    tightening of market liquidity could impact KCS’ access to
    capital. Further, KCS’ cost of debt can be impacted by
    independent rating agencies, which assign debt ratings based on
    certain factors including credit measurements such as interest
    coverage and leverage ratios, liquidity and competitive position.

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services
    (“S&P”) rates the senior secured debt as BB-, the
    senior unsecured debt as B+, and the preferred stock as CCC.
    S&P maintains a corporate rating of B and recently improved
    the Company’s outlook to stable. Moody’s Investors
    Service (“Moody’s”) rates the senior secured debt
    as Ba2, the senior unsecured debt as B2, and the preferred stock
    as B3. Moody’s maintains a corporate rating of B1 for KCS
    and B2 for KCSM and recently improved the outlook to stable for
    all issuers.

Long-Term
    Debt and Credit Facility Activity

KCSR
    Debt

On January 14, 2009, pursuant to an offer to purchase, KCSR
    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $200.0 million KCSR


/


% senior
    unsecured notes due June 15, 2009 (the
    “7


/


% Senior
    Notes”). KCSR received consents in connection with the
    tender offer and consent solicitation from holders of over 88%
    of the


/


% Senior
    Notes. On January 29, 2009, KCSR purchased the tendered
    notes in accordance with the terms of the tender offer with
    proceeds received in 2008 from the issuance of the
    $190.0 million 13.0% senior unsecured notes due
    December 15, 2013 (the “13.0% Senior
    Notes”), and other borrowings.

KCSM
    Debt

On March 30, 2009, KCSM issued $200.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes due April 1, 2016 (the
    “12


/


% Senior
    Notes”), which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual
    rate of


/


%.
    The


/


% Senior
    Notes were issued at a discount to par value, resulting in an
    $11.0 million discount and a yield to maturity of


/


%.
    The


/


% Senior
    Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank pari
    passu in right of payment with KCSM’s existing and future
    unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. KCSM used a portion of
    the net proceeds from the offering to repay all amounts
    outstanding under KCSM’s unsecured credit agreement dated
    June 14, 2007 (the “2007 KCSM Credit Agreement”).
    Upon repayment of the outstanding amounts, KCSM terminated the
    2007 KCSM Credit Agreement, effective March 30, 2009. The


/


% Senior
    Notes are redeemable at KCSM’s option in whole or in part
    on and after April 1, 2013, at the following redemption
    prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) plus any
    accrued and unpaid interest: 2013 — 106.250%,
    2014 — 103.125%, 2015 — 100.000%. In
    addition, KCSM may redeem up to 35% of the notes any time prior
    to April 1, 2012 from the proceeds of the sale of capital
    stock in KCSM or KCS and are



redeemable, in whole but not in part, at KCSM’s option at
    their principal amount, in the event of certain changes in the
    Mexican withholding tax rate. The


/


% Senior
    Notes include certain covenants that restrict or prohibit
    certain actions.

On January 22, 2010, KCSM issued $300.0 million
    principal amount of 8.0% senior unsecured notes due
    February 1, 2018 (the “KCSM 8.0% Senior
    Notes”), which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual
    rate of 8.0%. The notes were issued at a discount to par value,
    resulting in a $4.3 million discount and a yield to
    maturity of


/


%.
    KCSM used the net proceeds from the issuance of the KCSM 8.0%
    Senior Notes and cash on hand to purchase $290.0 million in
    principal amount of the


/


% senior
    unsecured notes due May 1, 2012 (the
    “9


/


% Senior
    Notes”) tendered under an offer to purchase and pay all
    fees and expenses incurred in connection with the KCSM
    8.0% Senior Notes offering and tender offer. The KCSM
    8.0% Senior Notes are redeemable at KCSM’s option, in
    whole or in part, on and after February 1, 2014, at the
    following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
    principal amount) plus any accrued and unpaid interest:
    2014 — 104.000%, 2015 — 102.000%,
    2016 — 100.000%. In addition, KCSM may redeem up to
    35% of the KCSM 8.0% Senior Notes any time prior to
    February 1, 2013 from the proceeds of the sale of capital
    stock in KCSM or KCS and are redeemable, in whole but not in
    part, at KCSM’s option at their principal amount, in the
    event of certain changes in the Mexican withholding tax rate.
    The KCSM 8.0% Senior Notes include certain covenants that
    restrict or prohibit certain actions.

On January 22, 2010, the Company purchased
    $290.0 million of the tendered


/


% Senior
    Notes in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender
    offer set forth in the offer to purchase using the proceeds
    received from the issuance of $300.0 million of the KCSM
    8.0% Senior Notes. Additionally, on February 1, 2010,
    the Company repurchased $6.3 million of the


/


% Senior
    Notes. KCSM recorded debt retirement costs of $14.9 million
    in the first quarter of 2010. The remaining


/


% Senior
    Notes mature on May 1, 2012 and are redeemable by KCSM at
    its option.

Common
    Stock Issuance

On April 27, 2009, the Company entered into an ATM Equity
    Offering

sm

Sales Agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (the “ATM Equity
    Offering”), under which the Company received proceeds of
    $51.4 million (net of commission of $0.9 million and
    fees and other expenses of $0.2 million) from the issuance
    of 3,204,900 common shares, at a weighted average sales price of
    $16.38. On July 31, 2009, the Company entered into a Common
    Stock Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors in
    which the Company issued 1,125,308 shares of the
    Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $20.00 per
    share on August 3, 2009 for aggregate proceeds of
    $22.5 million. This completed the Company’s offering
    of shares under the ATM Equity Offering and Common Stock
    Purchase Agreement.

During 2009, cash and cash equivalents decreased
    $112.4 million. Capital expenditures were partially offset
    by cash flows from operating activities, which decreased as a
    result of lower net income from reduced carload/unit volumes due
    to the downturn in the economy. In addition, the Company repaid
    $319.1 million of debt and received net proceeds of
    $262.9 million from the issuance of common stock and the


/


% Senior
    Notes. During 2008, cash and cash equivalents increased
    $174.4 million due to improved operating performance, net
    proceeds from the issuance of the 8.0% Senior Notes and the
    13.0% Senior Notes, and loan proceeds received from



financing locomotives, which were partially offset by a higher
    level of capital expenditures and redemption of the


/


% Senior
    Notes.

Operating Cash Flows.

Net operating cash flows
    for 2009 decreased $120.1 million to $292.9 million.
    The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily a result of
    lower net income from reduced carload/unit volumes due to the
    downturn in the economy. Net operating cash flows for 2008
    increased $45.2 million to $413.0 million. The
    increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to
    increased net income.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash
    outflows were $346.4 million and $538.0 million during
    2009 and 2008, respectively. This $191.6 million decrease
    was due to a reduced capital program in response to decreased
    operating cash flows. Net investing cash outflows for 2008
    increased $171.2 million as compared to 2007, which was
    related to a higher level of capital expenditures.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows
    were generated from the issuance of long-term debt, proceeds
    from the ATM Equity Offering and Common Stock Purchase Program
    and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee
    stock plans. Financing cash outflows were used for the repayment
    of debt, the payment of dividends on KCS’ preferred stock
    and the payment of debt costs. Financing cash flows for 2009,
    2008, and 2007 are discussed in more detail below:

•

Financing cash outflows for 2009 were $58.9 million. During
    2009, the Company repaid $319.1 million of debt, including
    the purchase of the


/


% Senior
    Notes and repayment of borrowings under the 2007 KCSM Credit
    Agreement. During the same period, the Company received net
    proceeds of $189.0 million from the issuance of the


/

•

Financing cash inflows for 2008 were $299.4 million,
    resulting primarily from the issuance of debt and the financing
    of locomotive purchases, partially offset by the redemption of
    debt. During 2008, KCSR issued $275.0 million of
    8.0% Senior Notes and used a portion of the proceeds from
    the issuance to redeem $200.0 million principal amount of
    the

•

Financing cash outflows for 2007 were $24.5 million,
    resulting primarily from the costs associated with refinancing
    debt and preferred stock dividend payments. During 2007, KCSM
    issued $165.0 million of

    reduce amounts outstanding under KCSR’s revolving credit
    facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement. KCSM entered into a
    credit agreement for a $30.0 million term loan facility and
    a revolving credit facility of up to $81.0 million. KCSM
    used the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the
    2005 KCSM Credit Agreement, to refinance a portion of the

Proceeds from the sale of KCS common stock pursuant to employee
    stock plans were $3.0 million, $8.6 million, and
    $0.7 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

•

Payment of preferred stock cash dividends were
    $11.0 million, $15.2 million and $23.3 million in
    2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Dividends of approximately
    $0.2 million were paid each year on the 4.0% noncumulative
    preferred stock; approximately $4.2 million and
    $15.0 million of dividends were paid in 2008, and 2007,
    respectively, on the Series C Preferred Stock which was
    redeemed during 2008; and approximately $10.8 million,
    $10.8 million, and $8.1 million of dividends were paid
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, on the Series D
    Preferred Stock. All cumulative dividends in arrears were paid

Contractual Obligations.

The following table
    outlines the material obligations under long-term debt,
    operating leases, and other contractual commitments on
    December 31, 2009

(in millions)

. Typically, payments
    for operating leases, other contractual obligations and interest
    on long-term debt are funded through operating cash flows.
    Principal payment obligations on long-term debt are typically
    refinanced by issuing new long-term debt or equity. If operating
    cash flows are not sufficient, funds received from other
    sources, including borrowings under revolving credit facilities
    and proceeds from property and other asset dispositions might
    also be available. These obligations are customary transactions
    similar to those entered into by others in the transportation
    industry.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual commitments for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

The Company is party to nine utilization leases covering 2,084
    railcars where car hire revenue as defined in the lease
    agreements is shared between the lessor and the Company. The
    leases expire at various times through 2015. Amounts that may be
    due to lessors under these utilization leases vary from month to
    month based on car hire rental with the minimum monthly cost to
    the Company being zero. Accordingly, the utilization leases have
    been excluded from contractual obligations above.

The SCT requires KCSM to submit a five year capital expenditures
    plan every five years. The next five year plan will be submitted
    in 2012 for the years 2013 — 2017. KCSM expects to
    continue capital spending at current levels in future years and
    will continue to have capital expenditure obligations past 2012.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of
    $100 million of 7.0% senior secured notes due November
    2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior obligations
    of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. KCS has pledged its
    shares of PCRC as security for the Notes. The Notes are
    otherwise non-recourse to KCS. The Company has agreed, along
    with Mi-Jack Products, Inc, (“Mi-Jack”), the other 50%
    owner of PCRC, to each fund one-half of any debt service reserve
    or liquidity reserve shortfall by PCRC, (reserves which were
    established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the
    Notes). As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s portion
    of this reserve shortfall was $3.9 million. The Company has
    issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of
    $3.9 million. The Company also has issued five irrevocable
    standby letters of credit totaling approximately
    $3.2 million to fulfill the Company’s fifty percent
    guarantee of additional equipment loans at PCRC.

Shelf
    Registration Statements and Public Securities
    Offerings

KCS has one current shelf registration statement on file with
    the SEC (the “Universal Shelf” —
    Registration

No. 333-155601).

The Universal Shelf was filed on November 21, 2008 in
    accordance with the securities offering reform rules of the SEC
    that allow “well-known seasoned issuers” to register
    an unspecified amount of different types of securities on an
    immediately effective

Form S-3

registration statement. The Universal Shelf will expire on
    November 20, 2011. On December 18, 2008, the
    Company’s subsidiary KCSR completed the sale and issuance
    of $190.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
    13.0% Senior Notes that were registered by means of the
    Universal Shelf. There remains an unspecified amount of
    securities available under the Universal Shelf.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’ accounting and financial reporting policies are in
    conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Management believes that the following
    accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
    understanding of KCS’ historical and future performance.
    Management has discussed the development and selection of the
    following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
    of KCS’ Board of Directors and the



Audit Committee has reviewed the selection, application and
    disclosure of the Company’s critical accounting policies
    and estimates.

Capitalization,
    Depreciation and Amortization of Property and Equipment
    (including Concession Assets)

Due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad,
    depreciation of property and equipment is a substantial
    operating cost for the Company and the industry as a whole. A
    significant portion of the Company’s capital expenditures
    are for capital replacement programs and track expansions which
    are generally constructed by employees. KCS capitalizes costs
    for self-constructed additions and improvements to property
    including direct labor and material, indirect overhead costs,
    and interest during long-term construction projects. For
    purchased assets, all costs necessary to make the asset ready
    for its intended use are capitalized. Properties and equipment
    are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis
    over their estimated service lives measured in years.
    Expenditures that significantly increase asset values or extend
    useful lives are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

KCS follows the group method of depreciation which applies a
    composite rate to classes of similar assets rather than to
    individual assets. Composite depreciation rates are based upon
    estimates of the expected average service lives of assets as
    well as expected salvage value at the end of their useful lives.
    The estimated average service lives of assets and salvage values
    are determined through periodic depreciation studies.
    Depreciation rate studies are performed every three years for
    equipment and every six years for road property (rail, ties,
    ballast, etc.). The depreciation studies take into account
    factors such as:

•

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and
    retirements of each asset class;

•

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the
    outlook for the continued use of the assets;

•

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance
    practices; and

•

Historical and expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

Also under the group method of depreciation, the cost of
    railroad property and equipment (net of salvage) retired or
    replaced in the normal course of business is charged to
    accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Gains
    or losses on dispositions of land or non-railroad property and
    abnormal retirements of railroad property are recognized through
    income. A retirement of railroad property would be considered
    abnormal if the cause of the retirement is unusual in nature and
    its service life is significantly shorter than what would be
    expected for that group based on the depreciation studies. An
    abnormal retirement could cause the Company to reevaluate the
    estimated useful life of the impacted asset class.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, KCS engaged an
    engineering firm to assist management in performing a
    depreciation study on equipment as well as to assess the
    adequacy of the accumulated reserves for road property. The
    results of the study determined that overall KCS’
    depreciation rates should be lowered to better reflect asset
    usage and replacement patterns. This change in accounting
    estimate was implemented effective January 1, 2009. The
    full year reduction of depreciation expense in 2009 resulting
    from the change in depreciation and amortization rates was
    $4.0 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, KCS changed its useful life
    estimates for KCSM’s concession assets. Previously the
    Company had limited the remaining life estimates to the current
    Concession term which ends in 2047. However, in consideration of
    KCS’ experience in operating under the Concession, the
    Company determined that it was probable that KCS will be able to
    extend the Concession rights for one

50-year

term. Based on this, the Company began amortizing the concession
    assets over the lesser of the current expected Concession term,
    including probable renewal, or the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. This change in accounting estimate was implemented
    prospectively effective October 1, 2009, reducing
    amortization expense in the fourth quarter by $2.6 million.
    The estimated remaining lives of KCSM’s concession assets
    will continue to be reviewed in relation to KCS’ experience
    in operating under the Concession.

Estimation of the average service lives of assets and salvage
    value requires significant management judgment. Estimated
    average service lives may vary over time due to changes in
    physical use, technology,



asset strategies and other factors that could have an impact on
    the retirement experience of the asset classes. Accordingly,
    changes in the asset’s estimated useful lives could
    materially impact future period’s depreciation expense.
    Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was $182.5 million. If the weighted
    average useful lives of assets were changed by one year, annual
    depreciation and amortization expense would change approximately
    $6.0 million.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the
    estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is
    reduced to the estimated fair value.

Provision
    for Personal Injury Claims

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
    personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
    crossing collisions and derailments is a substantial expense to
    KCS. Claims are estimated and recorded for known reported
    occurrences as well as for incurred but not reported
    (“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent with general
    practices within the railroad industry, the estimated liability
    is actuarially determined on an undiscounted basis. In
    estimating the liability, KCS bases the estimate on semi-annual
    actuarial studies, which calculates an estimate using historical
    experience and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous
    assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an
    estimate of future claim costs.

Personal injury claims are subject to a significant degree of
    uncertainty, especially estimates related to incurred but not
    reported personal injuries for which a party has yet to assert a
    claim. In deriving an estimate of the provision for personal
    injury claims, management must make assumptions related to
    substantially uncertain matters (injury severity, claimant age
    and legal jurisdiction). Changes in the assumptions used for
    actuarial studies could have a material effect on the estimate
    of the provision for personal injury claims. The most sensitive
    assumptions for personal injury accruals are the expected
    average cost per claim and the projected frequency rates for the
    number of claims that will ultimately result in payment.
    Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the
    liability for personal injuries claims is critical to KCS’
    results of operations. See also Note 12 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Based on the methods described above and information available
    as of December 31, 2009, the liability for personal injury
    claims was $86.9 million. A 5% increase or decrease in
    either the expected average cost per claim or the frequency rate
    for claims with payments would result in an approximate
    $4.3 million increase or decrease in the Company’s
    recorded personal injury reserves.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of the
    Company. For financial reporting purposes, management determines
    the current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of
    accounting for income taxes. The provision for income taxes is
    the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred into
    the future. Currently payable income taxes represent the
    liability related to the Company’s U.S., state and foreign
    income tax returns for the current year and anticipated tax
    payments resulting from income tax audits while the net deferred
    tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of
    deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance
    sheet. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based upon the changes in differences between the
    basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
    and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as
    measured using the enacted tax rates that management estimates
    will be in effect when these differences reverse.

In addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the
    reversal of tax differences, management must make certain
    assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or
    temporary. If the differences are temporary, management must
    estimate the timing of their reversal, and whether taxable
    operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully
    recognize any gross deferred tax assets of the Company. The tax
    provision for Mexico has additional complexities such as the
    impacts of inflation and exchange rate variations, both of which
    can have a significant impact on the calculations. Finally, the
    Company is required to pay the greater of Mexican income tax or
    the Entrepreneurial Tax of Unique Rate



(referred to by its Spanish acronym, IEUTU or Flat Tax)
    annually. The income tax net operating loss and credits will not
    fully offset future IETU payments thus a valuation allowance is
    necessary. Accordingly, management believes that the estimates
    related to the provision for income taxes are critical to the
    Company’s results of operations.

The general principles and complexities of income tax accounting
    related to Mexico apply to the calculation of the statutorily
    required Mexico employee profit sharing expense, current
    liability and deferred liability. The employee profit sharing
    expense is recorded within compensation and benefits in the
    consolidated statement of income.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax expense
    totaled $34.6 million. For every 1% change in the 2009
    effective rate, income tax expense would have changed by
    $1.0 million. For an increase of 1% in the Mexican
    inflation rate the tax expense would increase by approximately
    $0.7 million. If the exchange rate used at the end of 2009
    increased by Ps.0.10 from Ps.13.1 per U.S. dollar to
    Ps.13.2 per dollar, the tax expense would have decreased by
    approximately $1.9 million.

Provision
    for Environmental Remediation

As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

the Company’s operations are subject to extensive federal,
    state and local environmental laws and regulations in the
    U.S. and Mexico. KCS conducts studies, as well as site
    surveys, to determine the extent of environmental remediation
    necessary to clean up a site. These studies incorporate the
    analysis of internal and external environmental engineering
    staff and consultation with internal and external legal counsel.
    From these studies and surveys, a range of estimates of the
    costs involved is derived. These cost estimates are based on
    forecasts of the total future direct costs related to
    environmental remediation and change periodically as additional
    or better information becomes available as to the extent of site
    remediation required, if any. KCS accrues for the cost of
    remediation where the obligation is probable and such costs can
    be reasonably estimated.

Cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies
    related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
    and anticipated cost. Certain changes could occur that would
    materially affect management’s estimates and assumptions
    related to costs for environmental remediation. If KCS becomes
    subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at
    known sites, discovers additional contamination, discovers
    previously unknown sites, or becomes subject to related personal
    or property damage, KCS could incur additional costs that could
    be significant in connection with its environmental remediation.
    Accordingly, management believes that estimates related to the
    accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to
    KCS’ results of operations.

As of December 31, 2009, KCS had a liability for
    environmental remediation of $4.7 million. KCS’
    environmental liabilities are not discounted. This amount was
    derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    the accounting guidance for the recognition of loss
    contingencies. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if
    the December 31, 2009 environmental reserve was adjusted
    (increased or decreased) by 10%, environmental expense would
    change by $0.5 million.

OTHER
    MATTERS

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are
    of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
    Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
    current and former employees for job related injuries and by
    third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS
    aggressively defends these matters and has established liability
    reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected
    costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any
    legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s
    management, other than those proceedings described in
    Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition.

Inflation.

U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles require the use of historical cost, which
    does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement
    cost of property. Due to the capital intensive nature of



KCS’ business, the replacement cost of these assets would
    be significantly larger than the amounts reported under the
    historical cost basis.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
    inherent market risks, but these instruments have not been
    entered into for trading purposes. The following information,
    together with information included in Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 14 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that
    have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Floating-rate
    indebtedness totaled $350.6 million and $443.9 million
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A credit
    agreement, comprised of a revolving credit facility and term
    loan facilities, contains variable rate debt which accrues
    interest based on target interest indexes (London Interbank
    Offered Rate — “LIBOR” or an alternative
    base rate) plus an applicable spread, as set forth in the credit
    agreement. The Company has an aggregate notional amount of
    $250.0 million of interest rate hedges at December 31,
    2009, which effectively convert interest payments from variable
    rates to fixed rates. Given the balance of $100.6 million
    at December 31, 2009 of variable rate debt net of interest
    rate hedges, KCS is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates.
    For example, a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in
    each of the respective target interest indexes would result in
    additional interest expense of $1.0 million on an
    annualized basis for the net floating-rate instruments issued by
    the Company as of December 31, 2009.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of debt was approximately
    $2,031.1 million and $1,911.5 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, compared with a
    carrying value of $1,980.0 million and
    $2,086.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Commodity Price Sensitivity.

KCS periodically
    participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment and swap
    transactions. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, KCS did not
    have any outstanding fuel swap agreements. The Company also
    holds fuel inventories for use in operations. These inventories
    are not material to KCS’ overall financial position. Fuel
    costs are expected to mirror market conditions in 2010, however,
    fuel cost are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors
    outside the Company’s control. KCS is able to reduce the
    impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues
    from customers. Assuming annual consumption of 110 million
    gallons, a 10 cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would
    cause an $11.0 million change in operating expenses.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity.

KCSM uses the
    dollar as its functional currency. Earnings from KCSM included
    in the Company’s results of operations reflect revaluation
    gains and losses that KCSM records in the process of remeasuring
    certain transactions from pesos to dollars. Therefore, the
    Company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso.
    KCS manages this risk by monitoring its peso denominated cash
    inflows and outflows. For example, a hypothetical 10% increase
    in the U.S. dollar to the Mexican peso exchange rate on net
    peso denominated monetary assets of Ps.495 million would
    result in a loss of approximately $3.4 million and a 10%
    decrease in the exchange rate would result in a gain of
    approximately $4.2 million.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

KCS’ internal control over financial reporting was designed
    to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the framework established by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

(commonly referred to as the COSO framework).
    Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria
    outlined in the COSO framework.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
    firm, as stated in their attestation report, which immediately
    follows this report.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited Kansas City Southern’s (the Company)
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Kansas City Southern maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Kansas City Southern as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in equity and comprehensive
    income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated
    February 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in equity and comprehensive
    income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended December 31, 2009. These consolidated
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Kansas City Southern’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated February 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Note 1.

Description
    of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
    “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was initially
    organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. In
    2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas City
    Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal operations in
    rail transportation.

The Company is engaged primarily in the freight rail
    transportation business operating through a single coordinated
    rail network under one reportable business segment. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company realigned its segments into
    one reportable segment to reflect the strategic focus on the
    single coordinated rail network. Prior to January 1, 2008,
    the Company reported two segments. All prior period segment
    information has been recast to conform to the current year
    presentation.

The Company generates revenues and cash flows by providing its
    customers with freight delivery services both within its
    regions, and throughout North America through connections with
    other Class I rail carriers. KCS’ customers conduct
    business in a number of different industries, including
    electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum products,
    paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral products,
    automotive products and intermodal transportation.

The primary subsidiaries of the Company consist of the following:

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a
    wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary;

•

Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“KCSM”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary which operates
    under the rights granted by the Concession acquired from the
    Mexican government in 1997 (the “Concession”) as
    described below;

    subsidiary of KCS. On September 12, 2005, the Company and
    its subsidiaries, Grupo KCSM and KCSM, the Mexican holding
    company Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”), entered into a
    settlement agreement with the Mexican government resolving the
    controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
    government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
    the

purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM owned by the Mexican
    government. As a result of this settlement, KCS wholly owns
    Grupo KCSM and KCSM. Grupo KCSM was merged with KCSM effective
    May 8, 2007.

The KCSM Concession.

KCSM holds a concession
    from the Mexican government (the “Concession”) until
    June 2047 (exclusive through 2027, subject to certain trackage
    and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires), which is
    renewable under certain conditions for additional periods of up
    to 50 years. The Concession is to provide freight
    transportation services over rail lines which are a primary
    commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system. These lines
    include the shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico
    City and Laredo, Texas and serve most of Mexico’s principal
    industrial cities and three of its major shipping ports. KCSM
    has the right to use, but does not own, all track and buildings
    that are necessary for the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is
    obligated to maintain the right of way, track structure,
    buildings and related maintenance facilities to the operational
    standards specified in the Concession agreement and to return
    the assets in that condition at the end of the Concession
    period. KCSM is required to pay the Mexican government a
    concession duty equal to 0.5% of gross revenues during the first
    15 years of the Concession period and 1.25% of such
    revenues during the remainder of the period.

Under the Concession and Mexican law, the Company may freely set
    rates unless the Mexican government determines that there is no
    effective competition in Mexico’s rail industry. KCSM is
    required to register its rates with the Mexican government and
    to provide railroad services to all users on a fair and
    non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and
    safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican
    government. In the event that rates charged are higher than the
    registered rates, KCSM must reimburse customers with interest,
    and risk the revocation of the Concession.

Mexican Railroad Services Law and regulations and the Concession
    establish several circumstances under which the Concession will
    terminate: revocation by the Mexican government, statutory
    appropriation, or KCSM’s voluntary surrender of its rights
    or liquidation or bankruptcy. The Concession requires the
    undertaking of capital projects, including those described in a
    business plan filed every five years with the Mexican
    government. KCSM filed its third business plan with the Mexican
    government in December 2007 in which KCSM committed to certain
    minimum investment and capital improvement goals, which may be
    waived by the Mexican government upon application for relief for
    good cause. Mexico may also revoke KCSM’s exclusivity after
    2027 if it determines that there is insufficient competition.

The Concession is subject to early termination or revocation
    under certain circumstances. In the event that the Concession is
    revoked by the Mexican government, KCSM will receive no
    compensation. Rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the
    Concession, as well as all improvements made by KCSM or third
    parties, will revert to the Mexican government. All other
    property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause KCSM to lease all service-related assets to it for a
    term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican
    government will have a right of first refusal with respect to
    certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within
    90 days after any revocation of the Concession. The Mexican
    government may also temporarily seize the rail lines and assets
    used in operating the rail lines in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbances, or imminent
    danger to the domestic peace or economy for the duration of any
    of the foregoing events; provided, however, that Mexican law
    requires that the Mexican government pay KCSM compensation equal
    to damages caused and losses suffered if it effects a statutory
    appropriation for reasons of the public interest. These payments
    may not be sufficient to compensate the Company for its losses
    and may not be timely made.

Employees and Labor Relations.

Labor relations
    in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures (which
    include mediation, cooling-off

periods, and the possibility of presidential intervention) are
    exhausted. Contract negotiations with the various unions
    generally take place over an extended period of time and the
    Company rarely experiences work stoppages during negotiations.
    Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues
    have traditionally been addressed during these negotiations.

Approximately 80% of KCSR employees are covered by various
    collective bargaining agreements. KCSR participates in
    industry-wide bargaining as a member of the National
    Carriers’ Conference Committee. A negotiating process for
    new, major collective bargaining agreements covering all of
    KCSR’s union employees has been underway since the
    bargaining round was initiated in November of 2009. Long term
    settlement agreements were reached during 2007 and 2008 covering
    all of KCSR’s unionized work force through January 1,
    2010. The union labor negotiation has not historically resulted
    in any strike, boycott, or other disruption in the
    Company’s business operations. The Company does not believe
    the expected settlements will have a material impact to the
    consolidated financial statements.

KCSM union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which
    was signed on June 23, 1997, between KCSM and the Sindicato
    de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana
    (Mexican Railroad Union), for a term of 50 years, for the
    purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties and
    improving conditions for the union employees. Approximately 80%
    of KCSM employees are covered by this labor agreement. The
    compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to
    renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms are subject
    to negotiation every two years. In June of 2009, the negotiation
    of the compensation terms and all other benefits was started
    with the Mexican Railroad Union. The union labor negotiation
    with the Mexican Railroad Union has not historically resulted in
    any strike, boycott, or other disruption in KCSM’s business
    operations. KCSM does not believe the expected settlements will
    have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements are presented using the
    accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
    majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
    year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
    which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
    influence, but not a controlling interest. The Company evaluates
    less than majority owned investments for consolidation pursuant
    to consolidation and variable interest entity guidance. The
    Company does not have any less than majority owned investments
    requiring consolidation.

Basis of Presentation.

During the third
    quarter of 2009, the Company identified that changes in accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities related to capital spending had
    not been correctly presented in the Company’s prior period
    consolidated cash flow statements. Changes in these accruals had
    previously been classified within cash flows from operating
    activities and should have been classified as capital
    expenditures within investing activities, in order to report
    capital expenditures on a cash basis rather than on an accrual
    basis. The accompanying consolidated cash flow statements have
    been revised to present capital expenditures on a cash basis for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. This revision
    did not impact the change in cash and cash equivalents as
    previously reported, however, net cash provided by operating
    activities decreased by $42.7 million, from
    $455.7 million to $413.0 million and capital
    expenditures and cash used by investing activities decreased by
    $42.7 million from $580.7 million to
    $538.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    For the year ended December 31, 2007, net cash provided by
    operating activities decreased by $13.7 million from
    $381.5 million to $367.8 million and capital
    expenditures and cash used by investing activities decreased by
    $13.7 million from $380.5 million to
    $366.8 million. This revision did not impact operating
    income or net income, working capital, any earnings per share
    measures as previously reported.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial
    reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates
    and assumptions include those related to the recoverability and
    useful lives of assets, environmental remediation, personal
    injury claims, and deferred tax assets. Changes in facts and
    circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    freight revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a
    commodity movement as a shipment moves from origin to
    destination, with the related expense recognized as incurred.
    Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the product is
    shipped, as services are performed or contractual obligations
    fulfilled.

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss).

For financial
    reporting purposes, KCSM and its subsidiaries maintain records
    in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency. The
    dollar is the currency that reflects the economic substance of
    the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the entity.
    Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in pesos are
    remeasured into dollars using current exchange rates. The
    difference between the exchange rate on the date of the
    transaction and the exchange rate on the settlement date, or
    balance sheet date if not settled, is included in the income
    statement as foreign exchange gain or loss. For tax purposes,
    KCSM and its subsidiaries are required to maintain their books
    and records in Mexican pesos.

Cash Equivalents.

Short-term liquid
    investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
    when purchased are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable
    are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined
    by historical experience and adjusted for economic uncertainties
    or known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance when a
    customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has been transferred
    to a collection agent or submitted for legal action, or when a
    customer is significantly past due and all available means of
    collection have been exhausted. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $6.4 million
    and $8.7 million, respectively. Bad debt expense was
    $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For
    the year ended December 31, 2008, accounts receivable
    allowance recovery was $0.5 million.

Restricted Funds.

Restricted funds represents
    cash held by MSLLC which is restricted for use by KCS. These
    funds are restricted until they are used by MSLLC for capital
    improvements on the Meridian Speedway.

Materials and Supplies.

Materials and supplies
    consisting of diesel fuel, items to be used in the maintenance
    of rolling stock and items to be used in the maintenance or
    construction of road property are valued at the lower of average
    cost or market.

Derivative Instruments.

Derivatives are
    measured at fair value and recorded on the balance sheet as
    either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives are recorded either through current earnings or as
    other comprehensive income, depending on hedge designation.
    Gains and losses on derivative instruments classified as cash
    flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and are
    reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are
    impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item.
    The ineffective portion of all hedge transactions is recognized
    in current period earnings.

Property and Equipment (including Concession
    Assets).

KCS capitalizes costs for
    self-constructed additions and improvements to property
    including direct labor and material, indirect overhead costs,
    and interest during long-term construction projects. For
    purchased assets, all costs necessary to make the asset ready
    for its intended use are capitalized. Property and equipment is
    carried at cost and is depreciated on a



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

straight-line basis over their estimated service lives measured
    in years. Expenditures that significantly increase asset values
    or extend useful lives are capitalized. Repair and maintenance
    costs are expensed as incurred.

Costs incurred by the Company to acquire the Concession rights
    and related assets, as well as subsequent improvements to the
    concession assets, are capitalized and amortized over the lesser
    of the current expected Concession term, including probable
    renewal, or the estimated useful lives of the assets and rights.

KCS follows the group method of depreciation which applies a
    composite rate to classes of similar assets rather than to
    individual assets. Composite depreciation rates are based upon
    estimates of the expected average service lives of assets as
    well as expected salvage value at the end of their useful lives.
    The estimated average service lives of assets and salvage values
    are determined through periodic depreciation studies.
    Depreciation rate studies are performed every three years for
    equipment and every six years for road property (rail, ties,
    ballast, etc.). The depreciation studies take into account
    factors such as:

•

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and
    retirements of each asset class;

•

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the
    outlook for the continued use of the assets;

•

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance
    practices; and

•

Historical and expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

Also under the group method of depreciation, the cost of
    railroad property and equipment (net of salvage) retired or
    replaced in the normal course of business is charged to
    accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Gains
    or losses on dispositions of land or non-railroad property and
    abnormal retirements of railroad property are recognized through
    income. A retirement of railroad property would be considered
    abnormal if the cause of the retirement is unusual in nature and
    its service life is significantly shorter than what would be
    expected for that group based on the depreciation studies. An
    abnormal retirement could cause the Company to reevaluate the
    estimated useful life of the impacted asset class.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the
    estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the
    carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is
    reduced to the estimated fair value.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
    of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business
    combination. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the goodwill
    balance was $10.6 million which is included in other assets
    in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and intangible
    assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are
    reviewed at least annually, or more frequently as indicators
    warrant for impairment. An impairment loss would be recognized
    to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’
    fair value. In previous years, the Company completed its annual
    impairment review for goodwill using a measurement date of
    September

th

.

    During September 2009, the Company changed its impairment
    testing to the fourth quarter, using a measurement date of
    November

th

to

    more closely align the impairment testing date with the
    Company’s long-range planning and forecasting process,
    which is used as a basis for performing the annual impairment
    testing. The Company believes that the resulting change in
    accounting principle related to the annual impairment testing
    date will not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge.
    The Company determined that the change in accounting principle
    related to the impairment testing date is preferable under the
    circumstances. The Company performed its annual impairment
    review of goodwill and concluded there was no impairment in 2009
    and 2008.

Noncontrolling Interests.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, the Company adopted, on a prospective
    basis, new accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in
    consolidated financial statements, except for the presentation
    and disclosure requirements, which apply retrospectively. As a
    result of the adoption, the Company



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

reported noncontrolling interests as a separate component of
    equity in the consolidated balance sheets and the net income or
    loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately
    identified in the consolidated statements of income. Prior
    period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    period presentation. These reclassifications did not have any
    impact on the Company’s previously reported results of
    operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Effective
    January 1, 2009, KCS adopted the guidance prospectively for
    non-financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on
    a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are measured
    at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value
    only in certain circumstances. Fair value is defined as the
    exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
    The Company determines the fair values of its financial
    instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an
    entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
    use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
    hierarchy is broken down into three levels based upon the
    observability of inputs. Fair values determined by Level 1
    inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
    to access. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar
    assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than
    quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability, and include situations where there is little, if any,
    market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases,
    the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
    levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in
    the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement
    in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in
    its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance
    of a particular input to the fair value in its entirety requires
    judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or
    liability.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company records
    liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to
    past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future
    expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to
    their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation
    costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
    receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance
    activities related to current operations are expensed as
    incurred.

Personal Injury Claims.

Personal injury claims
    in excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to certain
    coverage amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of
    occurrence. The Company’s personal injury reserve is based
    on actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted basis. The
    reserve is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims
    incurred but not yet reported. While the ultimate amount of
    claims incurred is dependent on various factors, it is
    management’s opinion that the recorded liability is a
    reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims. Adjustments to
    the liability will be reflected as operating expenses in the
    period in which the adjustments are known. Legal fees related to
    personal injury claims are recorded in operating expense in the
    period incurred.

Health and Welfare and KCSM Post-Employment
    Benefits.

The Company provides certain medical,
    life and other post-employment benefits to certain active
    employees and retirees. The Company uses actuaries to assist
    management in measuring the benefit obligation and cost based on
    the current plan provisions, employee demographics, and
    assumptions about financial and demographic factors affecting
    the probability, timing and amount of expected future benefit
    payments. Significant assumptions include the discount rate,
    rate of increase in compensation levels, and the heath care cost
    trend rate. Actuarial gains and losses determined at the
    measurement date (typically December 31) are recognized
    immediately in the consolidated statement of income.

KCSM Employees’ Statutory Profit
    Sharing.

KCSM is subject to employee statutory
    profit sharing requirements under Mexican law and calculates
    profit sharing liability as 10% of KCSM net taxable income,
    adjusted as prescribed by the Mexican income tax law. Deferred
    employees’ statutory profit sharing is



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

accounted for using the liability method in a manner similar to
    income taxes and included as a component of compensation and
    benefits within the consolidated statement of income.

Share-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts
    for all share-based compensation in accordance with fair value
    recognition provisions. Under this method, compensation expense
    is measured at grant date based on the then fair value of the
    award and is recognized over the requisite service period in
    which the award is earned. Forfeitures are estimated at the time
    of the grant and revised, as necessary, in subsequent periods
    should actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

The Company issues treasury stock to settle share-based awards.
    The Company does not intend to repurchase any shares in 2010 to
    provide shares to issue as share-based awards; however,
    management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the
    level of shares outstanding.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of
    transactions reported in different periods for financial
    reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method
    gives consideration to the future tax consequences of the
    deferred income tax items and immediately recognizes changes in
    income tax laws upon enactment. In addition, the Company has not
    provided U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed
    operating earnings of its foreign investments since the earnings
    will be invested indefinitely or the earnings will be remitted
    in a tax-free transaction.

The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset, net of a
    valuation allowance, for net operating loss carryovers. The
    Company projects sufficient future taxable income to realize the
    deferred tax asset recorded less the valuation allowance. These
    projections take into consideration assumptions about inflation
    rates, currency fluctuations, future income and future capital
    expenditures. If assumptions or actual conditions change, the
    deferred tax asset, net of the valuation allowance, will be
    adjusted to properly reflect the expected tax benefit.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June of 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
    “FASB”) approved the “FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification” (the “FASB ASC”) to become the
    single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP (other than
    guidance issued by the SEC) superseding all then-existing
    non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. The FASB ASC does
    not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify
    user access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP through the
    introduction of a new structure providing all authoritative
    literature by topic in one place.

In December of 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

No. 2009-17,

“Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises
    Involved with Variable Interest Entities” (“ASU

2009-17”).

ASU 2009-17

addresses the elimination of certain exceptions to consolidating
    qualifying special-purpose entities which means more entities
    will be subject to consolidation assessments and reassessments.
    The statement requires ongoing reassessment of whether a company
    is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) and clarifies characteristics that identify a
    VIE. In addition, ASU

2009-17

requires additional disclosures about a company’s
    involvement with a VIE and any significant changes in risk
    exposure due to that involvement. This standard is effective for
    the Company beginning on January 1, 2010. The Company
    expects that the adoption of this standard will not have an
    impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial
    condition.

Note 3.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding for the period. Nonvested stock
    awards granted to employees and officers is included in weighted
    average shares as it is earned for purposes of computing basic
    earnings per common share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts
    basic earnings per common share for the effects of potentially
    dilutive common shares, if the effect is not anti-dilutive.
    Potentially dilutive common shares

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company’s short-term financial instruments include cash
    and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.
    The carrying value of the short-term financial instruments
    approximates the fair value due to their short-term nature.

The fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated using
    quoted market prices when available. When quoted market prices
    are not available, fair value is estimated based on current
    market interest rates for debt with similar maturities and
    credit quality. The fair value of the Company’s debt was
    $2,031.1 million and $1,911.5 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The financial
    statement carrying value was $1,980.0 million and
    $2,086.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value
    have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy as
    described in Note 2 — “Significant
    Accounting Policies”.

Investments with Level 1 and/or Level 2 inputs are
    classified as a Level 3 investment in their entirety if it
    has at least one significant Level 3 input.

The Company determines the fair values of its derivative
    financial instrument positions based upon pricing models using
    inputs observed from actively quoted markets. Pricing models
    take into consideration the contract terms as well as other
    inputs, including forward interest rate curves. As prescribed by
    the guidance, the Company recognizes the fair value of its
    derivative financial instruments as a Level 2 valuation.

The Company determined the fair value of its investment in a
    financial institution cash management fund based upon the value
    of the underlying investments. Underlying investments were
    valued using quoted market prices, if available. If quoted
    market prices were not available due to an inactive market,
    adjustments using unobservable inputs were required to determine
    the fair value. Because of these unobservable inputs, the
    Company recognized the fair value of its investment as a
    Level 3 valuation. The following table presents additional
    information about this investment in which the Company utilized
    Level 3 inputs to determine fair value.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    April 28, 2006, KCS, KCSR and the other subsidiary
    guarantors named therein entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement (the “2006 Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of $371.1 million with The Bank of Nova
    Scotia and other lenders named in the 2006 Credit Agreement. The
    2006 Credit Agreement initially consisted of a
    $125.0 million revolving credit facility with a letter of
    credit sublimit of $25.0 million and swing line advances of
    up to $15.0 million, and a $246.1 million term loan
    facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”). On May 31,
    2007, KCSR entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2006 Credit
    Agreement which provided for a new $75.0 million term loan
    facility (the “Term Loan C Facility”) under the 2006
    Credit Agreement. The revolving credit facility bears interest
    at either LIBOR, or an alternate base rate, plus a spread based
    on the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the 2006
    Credit Agreement. The Term Loan B Facility bears interest at
    LIBOR plus 175 basis points or the alternative base rate
    plus 75 basis points. The Term Loan C Facility bears
    interest at LIBOR plus



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

150 basis points or the alternative base rate plus
    50 basis points. The 2006 Credit Agreement contains
    covenants that restrict or prohibit certain actions, including,
    but not limited to, KCS’ ability to incur debt, create or
    suffer to exist liens, make prepayment of particular debt, pay
    dividends, make investments, engage in transactions with
    stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain
    assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations or in
    sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, KCS must meet certain
    consolidated interest coverage and leverage ratios. Failure to
    maintain compliance with the covenants could constitute a
    default which could accelerate the payment of any outstanding
    amounts under the 2006 Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the
    2006 Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the
    Company’s domestic assets and are guaranteed by certain
    domestic subsidiaries.

The final maturity date for the revolving credit facility is
    April 28, 2011 and the final maturity date for the Term
    Loan B Facility and the Term Loan C Facility is April 28,
    2013. Advances under the revolving credit facility totaled
    $40.0 million with revolver availability of
    $85.0 million while the Term Loan B and Term Loan C
    facility balances were $237.5 million and
    $73.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009.
    The Company’s obligations outstanding under the Term Loan B
    and Term Loan C facility are classified as long-term debt as of
    December 31, 2009. As the Company intends to repay the
    outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility during
    2010, the Company has classified the outstanding amount as a
    current liability as of December 31, 2009.

% Senior
    Notes and the applicable premium and expenses associated with
    the redemption and the remaining $1.3 million principal
    amount upon maturity. The remaining proceeds from the issuance

    13.0% Senior Notes were issued at a discount to par value,

KCSM 8.0% Senior Notes.

On
    January 22, 2010, KCSM issued the KCSM 8.0% Senior
    Notes due February 1, 2018, which bear interest
    semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 8.0%. The KCSM 8.0%
    Senior Notes were issued at a discount to par value, resulting
    in a $4.3 million discount and a yield to maturity of

    Notes tendered under an offer to purchase and pay all fees and
    expenses incurred in connection with the KCSM 8.0% Senior
    Notes offering and tender offer. The KCSM 8.0% Senior Notes
    are redeemable at KCSM’s option, in whole or in part, on
    and after February 1, 2014, at the following redemption
    prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) plus any
    accrued and unpaid interest: 2014 — 104.000%,
    2015 — 102.000%, 2016 — 100.000%. In
    addition, KCSM may redeem up to 35% of the KCSM 8.0% Senior
    Notes any time prior to February 1, 2013 from the proceeds
    of the sale of capital stock in KCSM or KCS and are redeemable,
    in whole but not in part, at KCSM’s option at their
    principal amount in the event of certain changes in the Mexican
    withholding tax rate.

All of KCSM’s senior notes described above are denominated
    in dollars and are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, rank

pari passu

in right of payment with KCSM’s existing
    and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, and are senior
    in right of payment to KCSM’s future subordinated
    indebtedness. In addition, the senior notes include certain
    covenants that restrict or prohibit certain actions.

5.737% Financing Agreement.

On
    February 26, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing agreement
    for an aggregate amount of $72.8 million. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance 85% of the purchase price of forty new
    SD70ACe locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM in late 2007
    and early 2008. KCSM granted the lender a security interest in
    the locomotives to secure the loan. The financing agreement
    requires KCSM to make thirty equal semi-annual principal
    payments of approximately $2.4 million plus interest at an
    annual rate of 5.737%, with the final payment due and payable on
    February 28, 2023.

6.195% Financing Agreement.

On
    September 24, 2008, KCSM entered into a financing agreement
    with DVB Bank AG (“DVB”). KCSM received the loan
    principal amount under the financing agreement of



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$52.2 million on September 26, 2008. KCSM used the
    proceeds to finance approximately 80% of the purchase price of
    twenty-nine ES44AC locomotives delivered and purchased by KCSM
    in June 2008. KCSM granted DVB a security interest in the
    locomotives to secure the loan. The financing agreement requires
    KCSM to make sixty equal quarterly principal payments plus
    interest at an annual rate of 6.195%, with the final payment due
    and payable on September 29, 2023.

Both locomotive financing agreements contain representations,
    warranties and covenants typical of such equipment loan
    agreements. Events of default in the financing agreements
    include, but are not limited to, certain payment defaults,
    certain bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and the failure
    to perform any covenants or agreements contained in the
    financing agreement. Any event of default could trigger
    acceleration of KCSM’s payment obligations under the terms
    of the financing agreements.

Other
    Debt Provisions

Other Agreements, Guarantees, Provisions and
    Restrictions.

The Company has debt agreements
    customary for these types of debt instruments and for borrowers
    with similar credit ratings containing restrictions on
    subsidiary indebtedness, advances and transfers of assets, and
    sale and leaseback transactions, as well as requiring compliance
    with various financial covenants. Because of certain financial
    covenants contained in the debt agreements, however, maximum
    utilization of the Company’s available lines of credit may
    be restricted.

Change in Control Provisions.

Certain loan
    agreements and debt instruments entered into or guaranteed by
    the Company and its subsidiaries provide for default in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    particular subsidiaries of the Company.

Leases
    and Debt Maturities

The Company leases transportation equipment, as well as office
    and other operating facilities, under various capital and
    operating leases. Rental expenses under operating leases were
    $139.0 million, $137.1 million, and
    $129.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. Contingent rentals and sublease
    rentals were not significant. Minimum annual payments and
    present value thereof under existing capital leases, other debt

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

Income
    Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
    reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred
    tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by
    the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
    differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as
    appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
    considered likely to be realized.

Difference Attributable to Foreign
    Investments.

At December 31, 2009, the
    Company’s book basis exceeded the tax basis of its foreign
    investments by $756.4 million. The Company has not provided
    a deferred income tax liability for the income taxes, if any,
    which might become payable on the realization of this basis
    difference because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest
    in foreign investments the operating earnings which gave rise to
    the basis differential or remit the earnings in tax-free
    transactions. Moreover, the Company has no other plans to
    realize this basis differential by a sale of its interests in
    foreign investments. If the earnings were to be remitted in a
    taxable transaction, as of December 31, 2009, the Company
    would incur gross federal income taxes of $264.7 million
    which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits.

Changes in Tax Law.

On October 1, 2007
    the Entrepreneurial Tax of Unique Rate (referred to by its
    Spanish acronym, IETU or “Flat Tax”) in Mexico was
    enacted. The Flat Tax law became effective on January 1,
    2008 and replaced the Asset Tax law. The Flat Tax applies to a
    different tax base than the regular income tax and will be paid
    if the Flat Tax exceeds the ordinary income tax computed under
    existing law.

On December 28, 2009, the final provisions of Mexico’s
    2010 tax reform were enacted. The income tax rate was increased
    to 30% from 28% for the years 2010 to 2012, 29% for 2013 and
    then returns to its current rate of 28% in 2014. The
    Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were
    revalued using the rates expected to be in effect when the
    underlying temporary differences are expected to reverse. This
    revaluation resulted in an $11.1 million benefit in the
    2009 tax provision. A 1% increase to the value added tax rate
    was also enacted, however, this increase will not have a
    material impact on the consolidated financial statements
    because, under Mexican law, value added tax is fully transferred
    to the final customer.

Tax Carryovers.

In prior years, the Company
    has generated both U.S. federal and state net operating
    losses. The losses are carried forward 20 years for federal
    and from 5 to 20 years for state. Both the federal and
    state loss carryovers are analyzed each year to determine the
    likelihood of realization. The U.S. federal loss carryover
    at December 31, 2009 is $101.1 million and if not
    used, would begin to expire in 2023. In addition, the Company
    has $16.9 million of tax credits consisting primarily of
    $15.1 million of track maintenance credits and
    $0.5 million of employment credits which, if not used, will
    begin to expire in 2025, and $1.3 million of alternative
    minimum tax credits which do not have an expiration period.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and separate
    tax filings from as early as 1994. The loss carryovers may
    expire as early as December 31, 2010 and as late as
    December 31, 2029. The state loss



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

carryover at December 31, 2009 is $450.4 million with
    a related $28.3 million tax benefit, of which it is
    expected that $162.4 million with a related
    $10.2 million tax benefit, will be realized.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at December 31, 2009 are
    $797.7 million, of which $110.1 million will begin to
    expire in 2016 and the remaining $687.6 million will expire
    in 2046. A deferred tax asset was recorded in prior periods for
    the expected future tax benefit of these losses which will be
    carried forward to reduce only ordinary Mexican income tax
    payable in future years. With the addition of the Flat Tax, the
    losses are not projected to completely eliminate future tax
    liabilities. A deferred tax asset is recorded for an asset tax
    credit carryover in the amount of $8.1 million which began
    to expire in 2008 at a rate of 10 percent per year. A valuation
    allowance of $11.9 million has been recorded to reflect the
    reduced expected tax benefit to be derived from these carryovers.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that the results
    of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to
    realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances,
    related to loss carryovers and tax credits.

Uncertain Tax Positions.

The accounting
    guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    guidance requires the Company to recognize in the financial
    statements the benefit of a tax position only if the impact is
    more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the
    technical merits of the position. The guidance also provides
    guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. The
    provisions were effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (

The remaining $2.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits
    would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized and is
    not expected to change in the next twelve months.

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are
    included in income before taxes on the income statement. Accrued
    interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are
    $0.2 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Company recognized less than $0.1 million in
    interest and penalty expense. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized a
    reduction of interest and penalty expense of $5.5 million
    and an increase of interest and penalty expense of
    $2.3 million, respectively.

The Company settled the audit of the U.S. consolidated
    federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2002 and
    paid the accrued tax liability in 2009. The U.S. federal
    statute of limitations has closed for years prior to 2004. The
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently
    examining the 2008 U.S. consolidated federal income tax
    return. As a result of the IRS settlement, the Company filed
    state amended tax returns for tax years

1997-2007.

Due to these filings, the statute of limitations for various
    states is open for years 1997 forward.

Tax returns filed in Mexico through 2002 are closed to
    examination by the taxing authorities in Mexico. The 2003
    through 2005 Mexico tax returns are currently under examination.
    The Company received a

preliminary audit assessment for the year ended
    December 31, 2003, from Servicio de Administracion
    Tributaria (the “SAT”), the Mexican equivalent of the
    IRS. The Company is currently in negotiations with the SAT, and
    if a settlement is not reached, the matter will be litigated.
    The Company believes that it has strong legal arguments in its
    favor and will more likely than not ultimately prevail in any
    challenge of this assessment. The Company believes that an
    adequate provision has been made for any adjustment (taxes and
    interest) that will be due for all open years.

Redemption of Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock.

On June 12, 2008,
    the Company called for redemption all of the outstanding shares
    of its 4.25% Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible
    Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred
    Stock”) with a redemption date of July 15, 2008 (the
    “Redemption Date”). The holders of the
    outstanding shares had the option to redeem at a redemption
    price of $500 per share or convert each share into
    33.4728 shares of KCS common stock. Each share converted
    also received an appropriate number of common stock or other
    preferred stock purchase rights under KCS’ 2005 Rights
    Agreement. All 400,000 shares of Series C Preferred
    Stock were converted into 13,389,109 shares of common stock.

Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock.

On December 9, 2005, KCS completed
    the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its 5.125%
    Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per
    share (“Series D Preferred Stock”). Each share of
    Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into
    33.3333 shares of KCS common stock, subject to certain
    adjustments. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are
    cumulative and payable quarterly in any combination of cash and
    KCS common stock, as declared by the KCS Board of Directors, at
    the rate of 5.125% per annum of the liquidation preference of
    $1,000. The Series D Preferred Stock ranks senior to the
    common stock and to each class or series of KCS capital stock
    that has terms that provide that such class or series will rank
    junior to the Series D Preferred Stock. On or after
    February 20, 2011, KCS may convert all of the Series D
    Preferred Stock into common stock at the then prevailing
    conversion rate, but only if the closing sale price of the
    common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect
    equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference for 20
    trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, and
    if KCS has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the
    dividend payment date immediately preceding the forced
    conversion date.

Upon certain designated events (a “fundamental
    change”), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may,
    subject to legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or
    all of the shares, which KCS may pay in either cash, in shares
    of KCS stock or any combination thereof, at KCS’ option.
    Since KCS has the ability in this event to pay the redemption
    price in KCS common stock (which is not required to be
    registered), the Series D Preferred Stock is classified as
    permanent equity capital. The number of shares to be issued
    would be based upon the value of KCS common stock at that time
    but in no event will the number of shares issued on the
    occurrence of a fundamental change exceed 52.5 million
    shares.

Common Stock Issuance.

On April 27, 2009,
    the Company entered into an ATM Equity
    Offering

sm

Sales Agreement with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith, Incorporated (the “ATM Equity
    Offering”), in which the Company received proceeds of
    $51.4 million (net of commission of $0.9 million and
    fees and other expenses of $0.2 million) from the issuance
    of 3,204,900 common shares, at a weighted average sales price of
    $16.38. On July 31, 2009, the Company entered into a Common
    Stock Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors in
    which the Company issued 1,125,308 shares of the
    Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $20.00 per
    share on August 3, 2009 for aggregate proceeds of
    $22.5 million. This completed the Company’s offering
    of shares under the ATM Equity Offering and Common Stock
    Purchase Agreement.

Dividend Restrictions.

Following completion of
    the preparation of the 2005 financial statements of KCS, the
    Company determined that its Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as
    defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes and


/


% Senior
    Notes) was less than 2.0:1. As a result, pursuant to the terms
    of each KCSR indenture, the Company was unable to pay cash
    dividends on its Series C Preferred Stock and dividends in
    cash or shares of KCS common stock on its Series D
    Preferred Stock. The dividends accumulated until such ratio
    increased to at least 2.0:1. On January 12, 2007, KCS
    declared a dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock and
    Series D Preferred Stock for all outstanding arrear
    dividends. As of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, KCS is
    current with respect to its Preferred Stock dividend payments.

    2005, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the
    Company’s common stock to stockholders of record as of the
    close of business on October 12, 2005, replacing a previous
    Rights Agreement that expired on October 12, 2005. Each
    right entitles the stockholder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or
    in certain circumstances, common stock, other securities, cash
    or other assets), at a price of $100 per share (both shares and
    price are subject to adjustment periodically to prevent
    dilution). The rights are traded with the Company’s common
    stock.

The Rights Plan has certain anti-takeover provisions that may
    cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire the Company without the approval of the Board of
    Directors. The Rights Plan will not interfere with any offer for
    all of the outstanding common stock that has the approval of the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Independent Directors. The rights will become exercisable after
    a non-approved person or group has acquired, or a tender offer
    is made for, 15% or more of the common stock of the Company (13%
    or more in the case of certain acquisitions by “Adverse
    Persons”). Right holders (other than the acquiring person
    or group) may then exercise their rights at the then current
    purchase price, and receive the number of shares of Preferred
    Stock (or in certain circumstances, common stock) having a
    market value of two times the purchase price of the rights.
    Additionally, if the Company is thereafter merged into another
    entity, or if more than 50% of the Company’s consolidated
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, holders of the
    rights may exercise their rights at the then current purchase
    price and receive common stock of the acquirer equal to two
    times the purchase price of the rights. KCS may redeem the
    rights for $0.0025 per right until a triggering acquisition. The
    rights expire October 11, 2010.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and
    certain of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with
    employees whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a
    change in control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock
    options become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
    automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
    specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
    trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
    entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts on December 31, 2009
    and 2008, were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at
    the time of any such change in control, the most significant
    factor of which would be the highest price paid for KCS common
    stock by a party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
    Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Note 10.

Share-Based
    Compensation

On October 7, 2008, the Company’s stockholders
    approved the Kansas City Southern 2008 Stock Option and
    Performance Award Plan (the “2008 Plan”). The 2008
    plan became effective on October 14, 2008 and replaces the
    Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and
    Performance Award Plan (the “1991 Plan”). The 2008
    Plan provides for the granting of up to 2.3 million shares
    of the Company’s common stock to eligible persons as
    defined in the 2008 Plan. Outstanding equity awards granted
    under the 1991 Plan and the 2008 Plan (the “Plans”)
    are to be governed by the terms and conditions of each
    individual plan and the related award agreements.

Stock Option Plan.

Options will be granted
    under the 2008 Plan at 100% of the closing market price of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant. Under the 1991 Plan,
    options were granted at 100% of the average market price of the
    Company’s stock on the date of grant. Options generally
    have a 5 year cliff vesting period and are exercisable over
    the 10 year contractual term, except that options
    outstanding with limited rights (“LRs”) or limited
    stock appreciation rights (“LSARs”), become
    immediately exercisable upon certain defined circumstances
    constituting a change in control of the Company. The Plans
    include provisions for stock appreciation rights, LRs and LSARs.
    All outstanding options include LSARs, except for options
    granted to non-employee Directors prior to 1999. The grant date
    fair value, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to expense
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:

The Company has not paid dividends to common shareholders since
    January of 2000 and currently does not expect to pay dividends
    to common stockholders in the future. The expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock
    price over a term equal to the estimated life of the options.
    The risk-free interest rate is determined based on the
    U.S. Treasury rates approximating the expected life of the
    options granted, which represents the period of time the awards
    are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical
    experience of similar awards.

    2,166,834 shares available for future grants under the 2008
    Plan.

Nonvested Stock.

The Plans provide for the
    granting of nonvested stock awards to officers and other
    designated employees. The grant date fair value is based on the
    average market price of the stock (under the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

1991 Plan) or the closing market price (under the 2008 Plan) on
    the date of the grant. These awards are subject to forfeiture if
    employment terminates during the vesting period, which is
    generally three year or five year cliff vesting for employees
    and one year for directors. The grant date fair value of
    nonvested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to
    compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting
    period.

    The fair value (at vest date) of shares vested during the year
    ended December 31, 2009, was $1.9 million.

Performance Based Awards.

During 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, the Company granted performance based nonvested stock
    awards. The awards granted establish an annual target number of
    shares that generally vest at the end of a three year requisite
    service period following the grant date or on January 17,
    2010. In addition to the service condition, the number of
    nonvested shares to be received depends on the attainment of
    performance goals based on the following annual measures:
    operating ratio, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
    amortization (EBITDA) and return on capital employed. The number
    of nonvested shares ultimately earned will range from zero to
    200% of the annual target award.

The performance shares earned in 2008 and 2007 were 85,640 and
    115,419 which was approximately 62% and 120% of the annual
    target award granted for the 2008 and 2007 performance periods,
    respectively. No performance shares were earned for the 2009
    performance period as the target was not met.

The Company expenses the grant date fair value of the awards
    which are probable of being earned based on forecasted annual
    performance goals over the three year performance period.
    Compensation expense on performance based awards was
    $1.7 million, $1.5 million, and $3.1 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. Total income tax benefit recognized in the income
    statement for performance based awards was $0.6 million,
    $0.5 million, and $1.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, there is less than
    $0.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
    performance based awards. The fair value (at vest date) of
    shares vested for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
    $0.6 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), established in 1977,
    provides substantially all full-time employees of the Company,
    certain subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities, with
    the right to subscribe to an aggregate of 11.4 million
    shares of common stock. The ESPP is subject to annual approval
    by the Company’s Board of Directors. Employees may elect to
    withhold an amount from payroll on the offering date in exchange
    for rights to purchase a fixed number of designated shares of
    the Company’s common stock.

On May 7, 2009, the stockholders of KCS approved the Kansas
    City Southern 2009 Employee Stock Plan (the “2009
    ESPP”), which replaces the ESPP for years ending after
    December 31, 2009. The 2009 ESPP provides for the issuance
    of a maximum of up to four million shares of common stock of the
    Company. Under the 2009 ESPP, eligible employees may contribute,
    through payroll deductions up to 5% of their regular base
    compensation during six-month purchase periods beginning
    January 18, 2010. At the end of each purchase period, the
    accumulated deductions are applied toward the purchase of the
    Company’s common stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP and the 2009 ESPP, the
    purchase price for shares is equal to 90% of the average market
    price on either the exercise date or the offering date,
    whichever is lower. Both the 10%

Profit
    Sharing and Other Postretirement Benefits

Health and Welfare.

Certain
    U.S. employees that have met age and service requirements
    are eligible for medical benefits and life insurance coverage
    during retirement. The retiree medical plan is contributory and
    provides benefits to retirees, their covered dependents and
    beneficiaries. The plan provides for annual adjustments to
    retiree contributions, and also contains, depending on the
    coverage selected, certain deductibles, co-payments,
    co-insurance, and coordination with Medicare. Certain management
    employees also maintain their status under a collective
    bargaining agreement, which permits them access to
    post-retirement medical under the multi-employer plan described
    below. The life insurance plan is non-contributory and covers
    union retirees only. The Company’s policy, in most cases,
    is to fund benefits payable under these plans as the obligations
    become due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds
    held in a life insurance company) exist with respect to life
    insurance benefits.

KCSM Post-Employment Benefits.

Mexican law
    requires that the Company provide certain post-employment
    benefits to its Mexican union and non-union employees.  These
    plans provide statutorily calculated benefits which are payable
    upon retirement, death, disability, voluntary or involuntary
    termination to employees who meet applicable service
    requirements.  In addition to these statutorily required
    post-employment benefits, the Company and the union have been
    engaged in negotiations regarding an incremental benefit that
    would be paid to the Company’s union employees upon
    retirement.  The current calculated liability related to this
    incremental benefit is based on various factors including
    retirement eligibility based on a combination of age and years
    of credited service and the employee’s salary at the time
    of retirement. As of

the date of this filing, the Company was still negotiating with
    the union regarding this benefit and details of this benefit
    continue to be discussed.

The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for its
    retirement benefit obligations.

Assumptions

The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs
    are selected based on current and expected market conditions.
    Discount rates are selected based on low risk government bonds
    with cash flows approximating the timing of expected benefit
    payments. The Mexico bond market is utilized for the KCSM post
    employment obligation and the U.S. bond market is utilized
    for the U.S. health and welfare obligation. The expected
    rate of return on life insurance plan assets is determined using
    historical and forward looking returns for similar investments
    over the period that the benefits are expected to be paid.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit
    obligations were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The Company’s health care costs, excluding former Gateway

    in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) with a maximum
    annual increase of 5%. Accordingly, health care costs in excess
    of the CPI limit will be borne by the plan participants, and
    therefore assumptions regarding health care cost trends are not
    applicable. The following table presents the assumed health care

Multi-Employer Plan.

Under collective
    bargaining agreements, KCSR participates in a multi-employer
    benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care
    and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees and
    certain retirees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as
    incurred and were $3.3 million, $3.4 million, and
    $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The Company
    sponsors the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the
    “401(k) plan”), whereby participants can choose to
    make contributions in the form of salary deductions pursuant to
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
    matches 401(k) contributions up to a maximum of 5% of
    compensation. The Company recognized expense of
    $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008 and $1.6 million for 2007, related to the KCS 401(k)
    and Profit Sharing Plan.

Note 12.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Concession Duty.

Under the Concession, the
    Mexican government has the right to receive a payment from the
    Company equivalent to 0.5% of the gross revenue during the first
    15 years of the Concession period and 1.25% of the gross
    revenue during the remaining years of the Concession period. For
    the year ended December 31, 2009, the concession duty
    expense, which is recorded within operating expenses, amounted
    to $3.2 million, compared to $4.3 million for the same
    periods in 2008 and 2007.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which,
    except as set forth below, are of an ordinary, routine nature
    and incidental to its operations. Included in these proceedings
    are various tort claims brought by current and former employees
    for job-related injuries and by third parties for injuries
    related to railroad operations. KCS aggressively defends these
    matters and has established liability reserves, which management
    believes are adequate to cover expected costs. Although it is
    not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding, in
    the opinion of management, other than those proceedings
    described in detail below, such proceedings and actions should
    not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial condition and liquidity.
    However, a material adverse outcome in one or more of these
    proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the results
    of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s
    U.S. operations are subject to extensive federal, state and
    local environmental laws and regulations. The major
    U.S. environmental laws to which the Company is subject
    include, among others, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA,”
    also known as the Superfund law), the Toxic Substances Control
    Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Hazardous
    Materials Transportation Act. CERCLA can impose joint and
    several liabilities for cleanup and investigation costs, without
    regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on current
    and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well as those
    who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous
    substances. The Company does not believe that compliance with
    the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will
    impair its competitive capability or result in any material
    additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs.
    The Company is, however, subject to environmental remediation
    costs as described below.

The Company’s Mexico operations are subject to Mexican
    federal and state laws and regulations relating to the
    protection of the environment through the establishment of
    standards for water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise
    pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling
    of hazardous and solid waste. The Mexican government may bring
    administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic
    sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and
    temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
    railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
    chemicals industry, the Company transports hazardous materials
    and has a professional team available to respond to and handle
    environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
    materials.

Additionally, the Company is a partner in the Responsible
    Care

®

program and, as a result, has initiated additional
    environmental, health and safety management system programs and
    has been certified by an outside professional auditing company
    in the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care
    Management
    System

®

.

    The Company performs ongoing reviews and evaluations of the
    various environmental programs and issues within the
    Company’s operations, and, as necessary, takes actions
    intended to limit the Company’s exposure to potential
    liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
    industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
    Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
    investigation and cleanup of contaminants, claims alleging
    personal injury, or property damage as the result of exposures
    to, or release of, hazardous substances. Although the Company is
    responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at
    several locations, based on currently available information, the
    Company does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
    collectively, to have a material impact on its financial
    position or cash flows. Should the Company become subject to
    more stringent cleanup requirements at these sites, discover
    additional contamination, or become subject to related personal
    or property damage claims, the Company could incur material
    costs in connection with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
    costs related to past activities when the Company’s
    obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
    operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
    liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
    undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
    may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
    Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
    management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or cash flows.

Environmental remediation expense was $4.8 million and
    $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, and was included in casualties and insurance
    expense on the consolidated statements of income. Additionally,
    as of December 31, 2009, KCS had a liability for
    environmental remediation of $4.7 million. This amount was
    derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    the accounting guidance for the recognition of loss
    contingencies.

Personal Injury Claim Reserves.

The
    Company’s personal injury claim reserve is based on
    semi-annual actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted
    basis. This reserve is based on personal injury claims filed and
    an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While the
    ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
    factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
    liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future payments.
    Adjustments to the liability are reflected within operating
    expenses in the period in which changes to estimates are known.
    Personal injury claims in excess of self-insurance levels are
    insured up to certain coverage amounts, depending on the type of
    claim and year of occurrence. The activity in the reserve
    follows

The personal injury claim reserve balance as of
    December 31, 2009 is based on an updated study of personal
    injury reserves for data through November 30, 2009 and
    review of the last month’s experience. The activity for the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2009 primarily relates to
    the net settlements and the reserves for Federal Employers
    Liability Act (“FELA”), third-party, and occupational
    illness claims. The



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

changes to the reserve in the current year compared to the prior
    year reflect the current accruals related to the favorable trend
    of loss experience, including favorable settlements, since the
    date of the prior study.

Reflecting potential uncertainty surrounding the outcome of
    personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible based on
    assessments that future costs to settle personal injury claims
    may range from approximately $83 million to
    $91 million. While the final outcome of these claims cannot
    be predicted with certainty, management believes that the
    $86.9 million recorded is the best estimate of the
    Company’s future obligations for the settlement of personal
    injury claims at December 31, 2009.

Certain Disputes with Ferromex.

KCSM’s
    operations are subject to certain trackage rights, haulage
    rights, and interline services with Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A.
    de C.V. (“Ferromex”). Other than the rates to be
    charged pursuant to the Trackage Rights Agreement, dated
    February 9, 2010, between KCSM and Ferromex, the rates
    payable for these services have not been agreed upon by KCSM and
    Ferromex for the periods beginning in 1998 through
    December 31, 2008. KCSM is currently involved in judicial,
    civil and administrative proceedings and negotiations with
    Ferromex regarding the rates payable under these arrangements,
    as described below.

KCSM and Ferromex both initiated administrative proceedings
    seeking a determination by the Mexican

Secretaría de
    Comunicaciones y Transportes

(“Ministry of
    Communications and Transportation” or “SCT”) of
    the rates that KCSM and Ferromex should pay each other in
    connection with the use of trackage rights. The SCT issued a
    ruling setting the rates for trackage rights in March of 2002.
    KCSM and Ferromex challenged the ruling.

Following the trial and appellate court decisions, in February
    2006 the Mexican Supreme Court sustained KCSM’s appeal of
    the SCT’s trackage rights ruling, in effect vacating the
    ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent
    with the Court’s decision. On June 27, 2008, KCSM was
    served with the new ruling issued by the SCT. In this ruling,
    the SCT established the consideration that KCSM and Ferromex
    must pay each other in connection with the use of the trackage
    rights granted in their respective concessions between 2002 and
    2004, and further stated that in the event KCSM and Ferromex
    failed to reach an agreement in connection with the rates for
    the years after 2004, the SCT shall make a determination along
    the same lines. In September 2008, KCSM and Ferromex appealed
    this new ruling with the Mexican

Tribunal Federal de Justicia
    Fiscal y Administrativa

(“Administrative and Fiscal
    Federal Court”), which as of the date of this filing has
    yet to issue a decision on the matter.

KCSM and Ferromex both initiated administrative proceedings
    seeking a determination by the SCT of the rates that the
    companies should pay each other in connection with the use of
    interline and terminal services. The SCT issued a ruling setting
    the rates for interline and terminal services in August of 2002.
    Both KCSM and Ferromex challenged the ruling. In April 2005, the
    Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court ruled in favor of KCSM
    in the challenge to the SCT interline and terminal services
    decision. Ferromex, however, challenged this court ruling before
    the Fifteenth Collegiate Court, and the Court ruled in its
    favor. Both Ferromex and KCSM appealed the ruling to the Mexican
    Supreme Court. On June 30, 2009, the Mexican Supreme Court
    sustained KCSM’s appeal and ordered the SCT to issue a new
    ruling consistent with the Court’s decision. As of the date
    of this filing, the SCT has not issued the new ruling on this
    matter.

KCSM expects various proceedings and appeals related to the
    matters described above. Although KCSM and Ferromex have
    challenged these matters based on different grounds and these
    cases continue to evolve, management believes the amounts
    recorded related to these matters are adequate and does not
    believe there will be a future material impact to the results of
    operations arising out of these disputes.

SCT Sanction Proceedings.

In April 2006, the
    SCT initiated proceedings against KCSM, claiming that KCSM had
    failed to make certain minimum capital investments projected for
    2004 and 2005 under its five-year business plan filed with the
    SCT prior to its April 2005 acquisition by KCS (collectively,
    the “Capital Investment Proceedings”). KCSM believes
    it made capital expenditures exceeding the required amounts.
    KCSM responded to the SCT by providing evidence in support of
    its investments and explaining why it



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

believes sanctions are not appropriate. In May 2007, KCSM was
    served with an SCT resolution regarding the Capital Investment
    Proceeding for 2004, in which the SCT resolved to impose no
    sanction. In June 2007, KCSM was served with an SCT resolution
    regarding the Capital Investment Proceeding for 2005, in which
    the SCT determined that KCSM had indeed failed to make the
    minimum capital investments required for such year, and imposed
    a minimal fine. KCSM has filed an action in the Mexican
    Administrative and Fiscal Federal Court challenging this ruling.
    KCSM will have the right to challenge any adverse ruling.

In May 2008, the SCT initiated a proceeding against KCSM at the
    request of a Mexican subsidiary of a large U.S. Auto
    Manufacturer (the “Auto Manufacturer”), alleging that
    KCSM impermissibly bundled international rail services and
    engaged in discriminatory pricing practices with respect to rail
    services provided by KCSM to the Auto Manufacturer. In March
    2009, the SCT issued a decision determining that KCSM had
    engaged in the activities alleged, but imposed no sanction since
    this was the first time KCSM had engaged in such activities. On
    May 6, 2009, KCSM challenged the SCT’s decision and
    the appeal is currently pending in the Administrative and Fiscal
    Federal Court.

On July 23, 2008, the SCT delivered notice to KCSM of new
    proceedings against KCSM, claiming, among other things, that
    KCSM refused to grant Ferromex access to certain trackage over
    which Ferromex alleges it has trackage rights on six different
    occasions and thus denied Ferromex the ability to provide
    service to the Auto Manufacturer at this location.

KCSM believes it has defenses to the imposition of sanctions for
    the forgoing proceedings and intends to vigorously contest these
    allegations. KCSM does not believe that these SCT proceedings
    will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations
    or financial condition. However, if KCSM is ultimately
    sanctioned by the SCT for “generic” sanctions on five
    occasions over the term of the Concession, KCSM could be subject
    to possible future SCT action seeking revocation of the
    Concession.

Concession Dispute.

On December 9, 2009,
    KCSM was notified of a lawsuit filed by Minera México, S.A.
    de C.V. (“Minera México”), a subsidiary of Grupo
    México, S.A.B. de C.V. and an affiliate Ferromex, against
    the Federal Government of Mexico, the SCT, Ferrocarriles
    Nacionales de México (“FNM”), KCSM, Nafta Rail,
    S.A. de C.V. (“Nafta Rail”), and KCS. The lawsuit
    claims that after the privatization bidding process for the
    acquisition of a majority interest in Ferrocarril del Noreste,
    S.A. de C.V. (“FNE”) (now KCSM) had concluded in 1997,
    in which the bidding was awarded to Transportación
    Ferroviaria Mexicana, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“TFM”) and
    the relevant stock purchase agreement was signed, the defendants
    improperly amended the stock purchase agreement and the
    purchasers paid a price lower than the price offered. The
    lawsuit alleges that the Mexican Federal Government, the SCT,
    FNM, KCSM, Nafta Rail and KCS violated a variety of the rules
    and regulations associated with the privatization bidding
    process. As a result of these alleged improprieties, Minera
    México claims the acquisition of FNE by KCS (through TFM)
    should be declared null and void and, consequently, the capital
    stock of FNE should be returned to the Federal Government of
    Mexico and Minera México, as the second place bidder in the
    bidding process, should be awarded the right to purchase the
    capital stock of FNE. On February 9, 2010, Minera
    México agreed to dismiss this lawsuit.

Disputes Relating to the Provision of Services to a Mexican
    Subsidiary of a Large U.S. Auto
    Manufacturer.

KCSM is involved in several
    disputes related to providing service to a Mexican subsidiary of
    a large U.S. Auto Manufacturer (the “Auto
    Manufacturer”).

In March 2008, the Auto Manufacturer filed an arbitration suit
    against KCSM under a contract for services to the Auto
    Manufacturer’s plants in Mexico, which, as amended, had a
    stated termination date of January 31, 2008. The Auto
    Manufacturer claimed that the contract was implicitly extended
    and continued in effect beyond its stated termination date. The
    Auto Manufacturer is seeking a declaration by the arbitrator
    that the rates being assessed by KCSM are discriminatory, even
    though the rates being charged are within the legal rate limits
    set by Mexican law for such freight transportation. KCSM claimed
    that the contract did in fact



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

expire on its stated termination date, and that services
    rendered thereafter are thus subject to the general terms and
    conditions (including rates) applicable in the absence of a
    specific contract, pursuant to Mexican law. Accordingly, KCSM
    filed a counterclaim against the Auto Manufacturer to, among
    other things, recover the applicable rate difference between the
    rates under the contract and KCSM’s rates. The arbitration
    was divided in two phases. On May 18, 2009, the arbitrator
    issued an award on the first phase of the arbitration
    proceeding, ruling that the contract had terminated on
    May 8, 2008. As of the date of this filing, the second
    phase of the arbitration proceeding, regarding the claim that
    the rates assessed by KCSM are discriminatory, is in the
    evidentiary stage and has not been resolved. Management believes
    the final resolution of these claims will not have any material
    impact on KCSM’s results of operations.

Mancera Proceeding.

In February 2006, Mancera
    Ernst & Young, S.C., (“Mancera”) filed a
    claim against KCSM seeking payment for an additional contingency
    fee for costs and expenses related to Mancera’s
    representation of KCSM in its value added tax or “VAT”
    claim against the Mexican government. Following litigation, KCSM
    was notified on May 29, 2009, that in a session held on
    May 28, 2009, the magistrates of the Twelfth Civil Federal
    Court of Appeals in Mexico decided by majority vote to deny
    KCSM’s most recent appeal. As a result of the decision,
    KCSM was required to pay Mancera $7.8 million related to
    the principal claim. KCSM previously made a good faith payment
    to the Mexico courts of $2.6 million in December 2007 and
    paid the remaining $5.2 million on September 4, 2009.
    On October 27, 2009, the Company paid the remaining
    obligation related to interest and legal costs, which did not
    have an impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Third Party Contractual Agreements.

In the
    normal course of business, the Company enters into various third
    party contractual agreements related to the use of other
    railroads’ or governmental entities’ infrastructure
    needed for the operations of the business. The Company is
    involved in certain disputes involving transportation rates and
    charges related to these agreements. While the outcome of these
    matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not
    believe, when finally resolved, that these disputes will have a
    material effect on its results of operations or financial
    condition. However, an unexpected adverse resolution could have
    a material effect on the results of operations in a particular
    quarter or fiscal year.

Credit Risk.

The Company continually monitors
    risks related to the downturn in the economy and certain
    customer receivables concentrations. Significant changes in
    customer concentration or payment terms, deterioration of
    customer credit-worthiness or further weakening in economic
    trends could have a significant impact on the collectability of
    the Company’s receivables and operating results. If the
    financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
    deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
    payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company has
    recorded reserves for uncollectability based on its best
    estimate at December 31, 2009.

PCRC Guarantees and Indemnities.

The Company
    has issued five irrevocable standby letters of credit totaling
    approximately $3.2 million to fulfill the Company’s
    fifty percent guarantee of additional equipment loans. The
    Company agreed to fund 50% of any debt service reserve or
    liquidity reserve shortfall by PCRC, reserves which were
    established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the
    7.0% Senior Secured Notes due November 2026 (the
    “Notes”). At December 31, 2009, the Company has
    issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of
    $3.9 million. Additionally, KCS has pledged its shares of
    PCRC as security for the Notes.

Note 13.

Settlement
    Agreement with TMM

In furtherance of the Company’s strategy for expansion into
    Mexico, on December 15, 2004, the Company entered into an
    Amended and Restated Acquisition Agreement (the
    “Acquisition Agreement”) with Grupo TMM, S.A.B.
    (“TMM”, formerly Grupo TMM, S.A.), and other parties
    under which KCS acquired full control of KCSM through the
    purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo KCSM.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

On September 24, 2007, KCS entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the “Agreement”) with TMM, TMM Logistics,
    S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of TMM, and VEX Asesores
    Corporativos, S.A. de C.V. (formerly José F. Serrano
    International Business, S.A. de C.V.) (the “Consulting
    Firm”), resolving certain claims and disputes over
    liabilities established as part of KCS’ acquisition of KCSM
    (successor by merger to Grupo KCSM). Pursuant to the terms of
    the Agreement, KCS agreed to pay TMM $54.1 million in cash
    to retire two notes totaling $86.6 million which were
    negotiated in 2005 at the closing of KCS’ acquisition of
    KCSM to cover certain post-closing contingencies and tax
    liabilities. The parties also agreed to terminate the consulting
    agreement between KCS and the Consulting Firm and make the final
    annual payment of $3.0 million, payable on settlement. The
    settlement amount of $57.1 million was paid by KCS to TMM
    on October 1, 2007.

Note 14.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company does not engage in the trading of derivative
    financial instruments except where the Company’s objective
    is to manage the variability of forecasted interest payments
    attributable to changes in interest rates or fuel price risk. In
    general, the Company enters into derivative transactions in
    limited situations based on management’s assessment of
    current market conditions and perceived risks. However,
    management intends to respond to evolving business and market
    conditions and in doing so, may enter into such transactions
    more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Credit Risk.

As a result of the use of
    derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to counterparty
    credit risk. The Company manages the counterparty credit risk by
    entering into contracts with large financial institutions with
    which the Company has an established banking relationship. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company did not expect any losses as
    a result of default of its counterparties.

Interest Rate Swaps.

During 2008, the Company
    entered into five forward starting interest rate swaps, which
    have been designated as cash flow hedges. The forward starting
    interest rate swaps effectively convert interest payments from
    variable rates to fixed rates. The swaps are highly effective
    and as a result there will be de minimus earnings impact
    associated with ineffectiveness of these hedges. The hedging
    instruments have an aggregate notional amount of
    $250.0 million at an average fixed rate of 2.71%, with
    forward starting settlements indexed to the three-month LIBOR
    occurring every quarter, expiring September 2010 through March
    2011.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

In January 2009,
    the Company entered into fuel swap agreements, which had been
    designated as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the
    gain or loss on the derivative instruments was reported as a
    component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified
    into earnings in the same period or periods during which the
    hedged transaction affected earnings. Gains and losses on the
    derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of the effectiveness
    were recognized in current earnings. During the second quarter
    of 2009, it became probable that the hedged transactions would
    not occur as forecasted. Therefore, the hedging relationship was
    dedesignated on May 31, 2009 and hedge accounting was
    discontinued. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
    instrument after dedesignation are recorded in earnings. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company has no outstanding fuel swap
    agreements.

Geographic
    Information

The Company strategically manages its rail operations as one
    reportable business segment over a single coordinated rail
    network that extends from the midwest and southeast portions of
    the United States south into Mexico and connects with other
    Class I railroads. Financial information reported at this
    level, such as revenues, operating income and cash flows from
    operations, is used by corporate management, including the
    Company’s chief operating decision-maker, in evaluating
    overall financial and operational performance, market
    strategies, as well as the decisions to allocate capital
    resources.

The Company’s strategic initiatives, which drive its
    operational direction, are developed and managed at the
    Company’s headquarters and targets are communicated to its
    various regional activity centers. Corporate management is
    responsible for, among others, KCS’ marketing strategy, the
    oversight of large cross-border customer accounts, overall
    planning and control of infrastructure and rolling stock, the
    allocation of capital resources based upon growth and capacity
    constraints over the coordinated network, and other functions
    such as financial planning, accounting, and treasury.

The role of each region is to manage the operational activities
    and monitor and control costs over the coordinated rail network.
    Such cost control is required to ensure that pre-established
    efficiency standards set at the corporate level are attained.
    The regional activity centers are responsible for executing the
    overall corporate strategy and operating plan established by
    corporate management as a coordinated system.

The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the fiscal year for
    which this annual report on

Form 10-K

is filed. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the current
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in reports filed or
    submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and include
    controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
    required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is
    accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting that occurred during the last
    fiscal quarter (the fourth quarter in the case of an annual
    report) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

(c) Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The report of management on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) is included as “Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” in
    Item 8.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that

    herein, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s

Other
    Information

We are providing the following disclosure in lieu of providing
    this information in a current report on

Form 8-K

pursuant to Item 8.01, “Other Events”. All
    capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings as
    set forth in the applicable agreements.

Trackage
    Rights Agreement

KCSM and Ferromex have entered into a Trackage Rights, Switching
    and Interline Settlement Agreement, dated February 9, 2010
    (the “Trackage Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the
    Trackage Rights Agreement, the Parties terminated, in a
    definitive and irrevocable manner, all actions and procedures
    regarding: (a) rates applicable to trackage rights,
    switching and interlinear services from January 1, 2009
    onward but not regarding the applicable rates before
    January 1, 2009 or the amounts owed by the parties to one
    another prior to the execution of the Trackage Rights Agreement;
    (b) the scope of certain trackage rights in Monterrey,
    Nuevo León, Guadalajara, Jalisco and Altamira, Tamaulipas,
    the Long Trackage Right, and Aguascalientes; and (c) court
    costs, as well as any other directly-related issue or dispute
    that arises from, is related in any manner directly or
    indirectly with, the terms and conditions

and/or

scope
    of such mandatory trackage

and/or

switching rights or that arises by reason of the definition of
    trackage rights (the “Settlement Controversies”). The
    parties waived their rights to any future actions derived from
    or related to the Settlement Controversies.

Further, KCSM and Ferromex set the rates applicable for
    January 1, 2009 onward applicable to each party for the use
    of that party’s trackage rights of the other party’s
    trackage.



Explicitly excluded from the scope and purpose of the Trackage
    Rights Agreement are all procedures, disputes, lawsuits,
    remedies, appeals and disagreements that were not expressly
    identified in the Trackage Rights Agreement, including without
    limitation, the disputes, claims and lawsuits that relate to the
    determination of rates for mandatory trackage

and/or

switching rights and for interconnection

and/or

terminal services, accrued prior to January 1, 2009, as
    well as the disputes among the parties regarding amounts payable
    to one another for trackage rights, interline services and
    switching services, that are currently being disputed by both
    parties at the Federal Court of Fiscal and Administrative
    Justice. Furthermore, the parties did not settle or agree to
    settle any other trackage and switching rights not specifically
    mentioned in the Trackage Rights Agreement.

The Trackage Rights Agreement shall remain in effect until the
    term of the concession title of Ferromex or the concession title
    of KCSM expire, unless the Parties mutually agree to renew the
    Trackage Rights Agreement beyond the expiration of either
    party’s concession title. The Trackage Rights Agreement may
    be terminated, at KCSM’s option, before its stipulated term
    if Ferromex is sold or if it transfers, directly or indirectly,
    its concession under its concession title. A change in control
    of KCSM or its affiliates, however, shall not be a cause for
    termination.

Settlement
    Agreement

On February 9, 2010, (i) KCSM and (ii) Ferromex,
    Ferrosur, Minera México, S.A. de C.V., Infraestructura y
    Transportes Ferroviarios, S.A. de C.V., Infraestructura y
    Transportes México, S.A. de C.V., Líneas Ferroviarias
    de México, S.A. de C.V., Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, S.A.
    de C.V., and Grupo México, S.A.B. de C.V. (jointly, the
    “Ferromex Parties”) entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to
    completely, definitively and irrevocably terminate (i) the
    private disputes, procedures and controversies among KCSM and
    the Ferromex Parties, in connection with the merger between
    Ferromex and Ferrosur, including KCSM’s involvement in such
    procedures as an interested party; and (ii) the lawsuit
    filed against KCSM and the Mexican Government in connection with
    several disputes, procedures and controversies before judicial
    authorities with respect to the acquisition of the shares of
    Ferrocarril del Noreste, S.A. de C.V. (now KCSM) by Grupo
    Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., in 1997
    (the “Settlement Procedures”). The parties waived
    their rights to any future actions derived from or related to
    the Settlement Procedures. Further, the parties did not settle
    or agree to settle any disputes, controversies or procedures
    other than the Settlement Procedures.

Under the Settlement Agreement, Ferrosur agreed to grant KCSM
    certain trackage and switching rights within Veracruz,
    México, and switching rights in the Puebla-Tlaxcala zone.
    In a related agreement, the parties further agreed to amend the
    FTVM by-laws to, among other changes, grant certain veto and
    voting rights to KCSM at the shareholders’ and the board of
    directors’ levels.

The Settlement Agreement shall remain in effect until the term
    of the concession title of KCSM expires, unless the parties
    mutually agree to renew the Settlement Agreement beyond the
    expiration of KCSM’s concession title. The Settlement
    Agreement may be terminated earlier upon delivery by KCSM of a
    notice to the Ferromex Parties indicating any breach by the
    Ferromex Parties of any of their respective obligations under
    the Settlement Agreement. Notwithstanding, the settlement and
    termination of the Settlement Procedures shall not be subject to
    rescission or termination.

The Settlement Agreement may be terminated, at KCSM’s
    option, before its stipulated term if Ferromex is sold or if it
    transfers, directly or indirectly, its concession under its
    concession title. A change in control of KCSM or its affiliates,
    however, shall not be a cause for termination. Likewise, the
    Settlement Agreement will terminate three years after Ferromex
    and Ferrosur cease to be under the common control of one person
    or group of persons acting jointly or in agreement to adopt
    coordinated resolutions (“Common Control”).
    Notwithstanding, if for any reason Ferromex and Ferrosur are
    under Common Control within five years after the Settlement
    Agreement is terminated due to Ferromex and Ferrosur ceasing to
    be under the Common Control, the Settlement Agreement would
    automatically be reinstated.



In November 2005, Ferromex acquired control of and merged with
    Ferrosur creating Mexico’s largest railway, though such
    merger has been previously rejected by COFECO. If the COFECO
    does not authorize the merger of Ferromex and Ferrosur, the
    Settlement Agreement shall be terminated twelve months after the
    relevant resolution of the Governmental Authority is issued or
    when the unwinding is effective, whichever is later.
