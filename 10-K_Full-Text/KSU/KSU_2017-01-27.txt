Item 1.

Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with domestic and international rail operations in North America that are strategically focused on the growing north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and industrial markets in the central United States with major industrial cities in Mexico. As used herein, “KCS” or the “Company” may refer to Kansas City Southern or, as the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of Kansas City Southern. KCS and its subsidiaries had approximately 6,820 employees on

December 31, 2016

.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a U.S. Class I railroad founded in 1887. KCSR serves a ten-state region in the midwest and southeast regions of the United States and has the shortest north/south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”). Through its 50-year concession from the Mexican government (the “Concession”), which could expire in 2047 unless extended, KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal international gateway through which a substantial portion of rail and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico crosses the border. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and three of its major seaports. KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the United States and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, the largest rail freight interchange point between the United States and Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to control and operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River between the United States and Mexico. The Company also controls the northern half of this bridge through its ownership of Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”).

KCSM also provides exclusive rail access to the Port of Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government is developing the port at Lazaro Cardenas principally to serve Mexican markets and as an alternative to the U.S. west coast ports for Asian and South American traffic bound for North America.

The Company wholly owns Mexrail which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex owns a 157-mile rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR with KCSM.

The KCS coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex) comprises approximately 6,600 route miles extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United States south into Mexico and connects with all other Class I railroads, providing shippers with an effective alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the southeast and southwest United States through alternate interchange hubs.

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), an unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international container shipping companies with a railway transportation alternative to the Panama Canal. The Concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of 25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional 25 year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south railroad traversing the Isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

KCSM Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM Servicios”), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary that provides  employee services to KCSM;

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a

seventy percent-owned

consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway.” Norfolk Southern Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns the remaining

thirty percent

of MSLLC.

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (“FTVM”), a

twenty-five percent-owned

unconsolidated affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary services in the greater Mexico City area; and



•

PTC-220, LLC (“PTC-220”), a

fourteen percent-owned

unconsolidated affiliate that holds the licenses to large blocks of radio spectrum and other assets for the deployment of positive train control (“PTC”). See Government Regulation section for further information regarding PTC.

MARKETS SERVED

Industrial and consumer products.

This sector includes metals and ores such as iron, steel, zinc and copper. The majority of metals, minerals and ores mined, and steel produced in Mexico are consumed within Mexico. The volume of Mexican steel domestic consumption and exports fluctuates based on global market prices. Higher-end finished products such as steel coils are used by Mexican manufacturers in automobiles, household appliances, the oil and gas industry, and other consumer goods which are imported from the United States through land borders and through the seaports served by KCS’s rail network. KCS also transports steel coils, plates and pipe from U.S. and Mexican based mini-mills to locations in the U.S. and Mexico for oil drilling, appliance and automotive applications.

This sector also serves paper mills directly and indirectly through its various short-line connections. KCS’s rail lines run through the heart of the southeast United States timber-producing region. Additionally, KCS is uniquely positioned to serve many paper mills in the southeast United States whose products are increasing in demand due to a general growth of consumer goods and industrial production in central Mexico.

Agriculture and minerals.

The agriculture and minerals sector consists primarily of grain and food products. Shipper demand for agriculture products is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain products, as well as price fluctuations in international markets for key commodities. In the United States, KCS’s rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills, food and industrial consumers in the U.S. and Mexico. United States export grain shipments and Mexico import grain shipments include primarily corn, wheat, and soybeans. Over the long term, export grain shipments to Mexico are expected to increase as a result of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports and KCS’s coordinated rail network is well positioned to meet these increases in demand. Food products consist mainly of soybean meal, grain meal, oils, canned goods, distillers dried grains, corn syrup and sugar. Other shipments consist of a variety of products including ores, minerals, clay and glass used across North America.

Energy.

The energy sector includes coal, frac sand, petroleum coke and crude oil. KCS hauls unit trains (trains transporting a single commodity from one source to one destination) of coal for nine electric generating plants in the central United States. The coal originates from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and is interchanged to KCS at Kansas City, Missouri. Coal mined in the midwest United States is transported in non-unit trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills, steel mills, and cement companies. Frac sand originating primarily in Wisconsin, Illinois or Iowa is delivered to transloads located in northeast Texas, northern Louisiana and south Texas for distribution to gas and oil wells in the region. KCS transports petroleum coke from refineries in the United States to cement companies in Mexico as well as to vessels for international distribution through the Pabtex export terminal located in Port Arthur, Texas. The majority of crude by rail



business originates in Canada and Utah, with spot shipments coming from west Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, and is delivered to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and tank farms in Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama.

Intermodal.

The intermodal freight sector consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck trailers on behalf of steamship lines, motor carriers, and intermodal marketing companies with rail carriers serving as long-distance haulers. KCS serves and supports the U.S. and Mexican markets, as well as cross border traffic between the U.S. and Mexico. In light of the importance of trade between Asia and North America, the Company believes the Port of Lazaro Cardenas continues to be a strategically beneficial location for ocean carriers, manufacturers and retailers. Equally important, the increase in foreign direct investment in Mexico has caused the KCS Mexico/U.S. cross border corridor to emerge as an increasingly important tool for the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) freight flow. The Company also provides premium service to customers over its line from Dallas through the Meridian Speedway — a critical link in creating the most direct route between the southwest and southeast/northeast U.S.

Automotive.

KCS provides rail transportation to every facet of the automotive industry supply chain, including automotive manufacturers, assembly plants and distribution centers throughout North America. Several U.S., European and Asian automakers have built or intend to build assembly plants in central Mexico to take advantage of access to lower costs, which has driven a shift in production and distribution patterns from the U.S. to Mexico. In addition, KCS transports finished vehicles imported and exported to and from Asia through a distribution facility at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas. As the automotive industry shifts production and distribution patterns, KCS is poised to serve the automotive industry’s evolving transportation requirements.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The Company’s United States operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses subject to federal preemption under certain circumstances. Rail operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and consolidation or merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers. DOT and OSHA each has jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. In 2008, the President of the United States signed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law, which, among other things, revised hours of service for train and certain other employees and mandated implementation of PTC at certain locations by the end of 2015. PTC is a technology designed to help prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned at certain locations, including main line track where toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard movements occur or where passenger operations occur. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 extended the PTC implementation deadline from the end of 2015 to the end of 2018, conditioned upon the filing of revised PTC Implementation Plans, with a further two-year extension possible subject to review by the DOT. KCS filed a revised PTC Implementation Plan by the statutory due date. PTC will add to operating costs, increase the number of employees the Company employs and require KCS to make significant investments in new safety technology.

KCS’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican operations is overseen by the new Mexican Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario (“Regulatory Agency of Rail Transportation” or “ARTF”). The ARTF establishes regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and is responsible for resolving disputes between railways and between railways and customers. KCSM must register its maximum rates with the ARTF and make regular reports to the ARTF and the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (“Secretary of Communications and Transportation” or “SCT”) on investment and traffic volumes. The Company may freely set rates on a non-discriminatory basis. If the ARTF or another party considers there to be no effective competition, they can request an opinion from the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (“Mexican Antitrust Commission” or “COFECE”) regarding market conditions. If the COFECE determines that there is no effective competition for particular movements, the ARTF could set fixed maximum rates for those movements.



KCSM holds a concession from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusive through 2027, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires), which is renewable under certain conditions for an additional period of up to

50 years

(the “Concession”). The Concession authorizes KCSM to provide freight transportation services over north-east rail lines which are a primary commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system. KCSM is required to provide railroad services to all users on a fair and non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican government. KCSM has the right to use, but does not own, all track and buildings that are necessary for the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is obligated to maintain the right of way, track structure, buildings and related maintenance facilities to the operational standards specified in the Concession agreement and to return the assets in that condition at the end of the Concession period. During the Concession period, KCSM is required to pay the Mexican government an annual concession duty equal to

1.25%

of gross revenues.

The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment through the establishment of standards for water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or, with respect to KCSM, the termination of the Concession. KCS maintains environmental provisions that are believed by management to be appropriate with respect to known and existing environmental contamination of its properties that KCS may be responsible to remedy. In addition, KCS’s subsidiaries are party to contracts and other legally binding obligations by which previous owners of certain facilities now owned by KCS are responsible to remedy contamination of such sites remaining from their previous ownership. There are currently no material legal or administrative proceedings pending against the Company with respect to any environmental matters and management does not believe that continued compliance with environmental laws will have any material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. KCS cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

COMPETITION

The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources. The railroad industry in North America is dominated by a few very large carriers. The larger U.S. western railroads (BNSF Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are significant competitors of KCS because of their substantial resources and competitive routes.

In Mexico, KCSM’s operations are subject to competition from other railroads, particularly Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”) and Ferrosur, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”), both controlled by Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V. Ferromex and Ferrosur together are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than KCSM, serving most of the major ports and cities in Mexico and together owning fifty percent of FTVM, which serves industries located within Mexico City.

The ongoing impact of past and future rail consolidation is uncertain. However, KCS believes that its investments and strategic alliances continue to competitively position the Company to attract additional rail traffic throughout its rail network.

The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain routes in KCS’s operating areas. In the past, truck carriers have generally eroded the railroad industry’s share of total transportation revenues. Intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition, particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers, including KCS, have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working with motor carriers to provide end-to-end transportation of products.

While deregulation of U.S. freight rates has enhanced the ability of railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes of transportation, this increased competition has generally resulted in downward pressure on freight rates since deregulation. Competition with other railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities.



RAIL SECURITY

The Company and its rail subsidiaries have continued to research, develop and implement multidisciplinary approaches to secure the Company’s assets and personnel against transnational criminal organizations that actively target transportation networks. In addition, the Company has developed a variety of vertically integrated strategies to mitigate the risk terrorist attacks could pose to the Company, its personnel and assets. Many of the specific measures the Company utilizes for these efforts are required to be kept confidential through arrangements with government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), or through jointly-developed and implemented strategies and plans with connecting carriers.

KCSR and KCSM developed a proprietary security plan based on an industry-wide plan developed by the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) members which focuses on comprehensive risk assessments in five areas — hazardous materials; train operations; critical physical assets; military traffic; and information technology and communications. The security plan is kept confidential, with access to the plan tightly limited to members of management with direct security and anti-terrorism implementation responsibilities. The Company participates with other AAR members in periodic drills under the industry plan to test and refine its various provisions.

To protect the confidentiality and sensitivity of both the AAR plans and the proprietary strategies the Company has developed to safeguard against criminal enterprises, terrorism, and other security and safety threats, the following paragraphs will provide only a general overview of some of these efforts.

The Company’s security activities range from periodically providing security awareness updates to KCS employees and including safety and security information on the Company’s internet website (which can be found under the “Corporate Responsibility” tab at www.kcsouthern.com) to its ongoing implementation of security plans for rail facilities in areas labeled by the DHS as High Threat Urban Areas (“HTUAs”). The Company’s other activities to bolster security against terrorism include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Conferring regularly with other railroads’ security personnel and with industry experts on security issues;

•

Routing shipments of certain chemicals, which might be toxic if inhaled, pursuant to federal regulations;

•

Initiating a series of over 20 voluntary action items agreed to between AAR and DHS as enhancing security in the rail industry;

•

Conducting constant and targeted security training as part of the scheduled training for operating employees and managers;

•

Development of smartphone applications to ensure immediate information, live video and pictures from security supervisors and protection assets pertaining to potential operational risks;

•

Developing a multi-layered security model using high-speed digital imaging, system velocity and covert and overt security filters to mitigate the risk of illicit activity;

•

Measuring key security metrics to ensure positive risk mitigation and product integrity trends;

•

Performing constant due diligence with the existing security model and by benchmarking rail security on a world-wide basis to monitor threat streams related to rail incidents;

•

Implementation of a Tactical Intelligence Center by KCSM, constant training with core members in new technology helping to prevent, detect, deter, deny and respond to potentially illicit activities; and

•

Deployment of an array of non-intrusive technologies including, but not limited to, digital video surveillance and analytics as part of an intelligent video security solution, including a Closed Circuit Television platform with geo-fencing for intrusion detection, to allow for remote viewing access to monitor ports of entry, intermodal and rail yards.

In addition, the Company utilizes dedicated security personnel with extensive special operations forces, intelligence, and law enforcement backgrounds to oversee the ongoing and increasingly complex security efforts of the Company in both the United States and Mexico. While the risk of theft and vandalism is higher in Mexico, KCSM remains among the safest methods of transportation for freight shipments in Mexico. KCSM’s record in rail safety is due in large part to the implementation of a multi-layered safety and security process throughout the KCSM network. In addition to having its own internal system, the process is connected to, and supported by a high level of federal, state and local law enforcement. A primary focus of this effort involves maintaining constant due diligence, intelligence and counter intelligence operations, technology reporting applications and active vigilance while enhancing overall system velocity, which reduces the residual risk for incidents to occur.



RAILWAY LABOR ACT

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for modification, but their terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of presidential intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and the Company rarely experiences work stoppages during negotiations. Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have traditionally been addressed during these negotiations.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

Approximately

75%

of KCSR employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements do not have expiration dates, but rather remain in place until modified by subsequent agreements. KCSR participates in industry-wide multi-employer bargaining as a member of the National Carriers’ Conference Committee, as well as local bargaining for agreements that are limited to KCSR's property. Multi-employer agreements are subject to a procedure that allows requests for changes to be served every five years. The last amendments to the collective bargaining agreements with all of the participating unions were reached and ratified during 2011 and the first half of 2012, and were retroactive to January 1, 2010. The current round of multi-employer bargaining began on January 1, 2015. The subjects of bargaining primarily concern salary and benefits payable to the various union employees. The union labor negotiation has not historically resulted in any strike, lock-out, or other disruption in the Company’s business operations. The Company does not believe the expected settlements will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

KCSM Servicios union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which was signed on April 16, 2012, between KCSM Servicios and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana (“Mexican Railroad Union”), for an indefinite period of time, for the purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties. Approximately

80%

of KCSM Servicios employees are covered by this labor agreement. The compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and all other benefits are subject to negotiation every two years. The union labor negotiations with the Mexican Railroad Union have not historically resulted in any strike, boycott or other disruption in KCSM’s business operations. On November 4, 2016, the compensation terms covering the period from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, were finalized between KCSM Servicios and the Mexican Railroad Union. The finalization of the compensation terms did not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

KCS, as a common carrier by rail, is required by United States and Mexican laws to transport hazardous materials, which could expose KCS to significant costs and claims.

Under United States federal statutes and applicable Mexican laws, KCS’s common carrier responsibility requires it to transport hazardous materials. Any rail accident or other incident or accident on KCS’s network, facilities, or at the facilities of KCS’s customers involving the release of hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard (or TIH) materials, could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of the Company’s insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s business is subject to regulation by federal, state and local legislatures and agencies that could impose significant cost on the Company’s business operations.

KCS is subject to legislation and regulation enacted by federal, state and local legislatures and agencies in the U.S. and Mexico with respect to railroad operations. Government regulation of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the competitiveness and profitability of railroads. Changes in legislation or regulation could have a negative impact on KCS’s ability to negotiate prices for rail services, could negatively affect competition among rail carriers, or could negatively impact operating practices, resulting in reduced efficiency, increased operating costs or increased capital investment, all of which could result in a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

New economic regulation in the U.S. or Mexico in current or future proceedings could change the regulatory framework within which the Company operates which could materially change the Company's business and have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Amendments to the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law became effective in January 2015 and the new Mexican antitrust legislation became effective in July 2014. Under Article 47 of the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law and its regulations, if the COFECE determines that effective competition does not exist, then the ARTF has authority to impose new limited mandatory trackage rights and/or rate regulation.

COFECE´s antitrust review is underway. The purpose of that review is to determine whether or not there is “effective competition” in the rail markets for interconnection services, switching rights and trackage rights. The COFECE review includes the entire freight rail transportation market in Mexico and is not targeted to any single rail carrier. Notwithstanding that, it is too early to determine what, if any, impact this review may have on Mexican rail operations in the future, if the COFECE determines there is a lack of effective competition, it could request the ARTF to establish new limited mandatory trackage rights and/or rate regulation under the Amendments to the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law. COFECE has extended its own preliminary report deadline to January 30, 2017.

COFECE has not published guidelines regarding the factors that constitute a lack of competition. It is, therefore, unclear under what particular circumstances COFECE would deem a lack of competition to exist. If the ARTF intervenes and imposes  remedies, it may negatively impact profitability.

As part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 in the United States, Class I railroad carriers and passenger and commuter rail operators must implement PTC, a technology designed to help prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned. PTC is required to be implemented at certain locations, including main line track where toxic inhalation hazard movements regularly occur or where passenger operations occur. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 extended the PTC implementation deadline from the end of 2015 to the end of 2018, conditioned upon the filing of revised PTC Implementation Plans, with a further two-year



extension possible subject to review by the Department of Transportation. KCS filed a revised PTC Implementation Plan by the statutory due date. PTC will add to operating costs, increase the number of employees the Company employs and require KCS to make significant investments in new safety technology. KCS’s failure to meet deadlines, including any extension, could result in fines, service interruptions or penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s inadvertent failure or inability to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and operations, including fines, penalties, or limitations on operating activities until compliance with applicable requirements is achieved. Congress and government agencies may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which the Company operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on the Company’s business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure to obtain or maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations could adversely affect KCS’s business operations.

KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

KCSM operates under the Concession granted by the Mexican government until June 2047, which is renewable for an additional period of up to 50 years, subject to certain conditions. The Concession gives KCSM exclusive rights to provide freight transportation services over its rail lines for the first 30 years of the 50-year Concession, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires. The SCT and ARTF, which are principally responsible for regulating railroad services in Mexico, have broad powers to monitor KCSM’s compliance with the Concession, and they can require KCSM to supply them with any technical, administrative and financial information they request. Among other obligations, KCSM must comply with the investment commitments established in its business plan, which forms an integral part of the Concession, and must update the plan every three years. The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans confidentially. The SCT and ARTF also monitor KCSM’s compliance with efficiency and safety standards established in the Concession. The SCT and ARTF review, and may amend, these standards from time to time.

Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the Concession, it would own, control, and manage such public domain assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. All other property not covered by the Concession, including all locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, would remain KCSM’s property. In the event of early termination, or total or partial revocation of the Concession, the Mexican government would have the right to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for additional one-year terms up to five years. The amount of rent would be determined by experts appointed by KCSM and the Mexican government. The Mexican government must exercise this right within four months after early termination or revocation of the Concession. In addition, the Mexican government would also have a right of first refusal with respect to certain transfers by KCSM of railroad equipment within 90 days after revocation of the Concession.

The Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural disaster, war, significant public disturbance or imminent danger to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT may restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in such manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances, but only for the duration of any of the foregoing events. Mexican law requires that the Mexican government pay compensation if it effects a statutory appropriation for reasons of the public interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due to any cause other than international war, the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law and regulations provide that the Mexican government will indemnify an affected concessionaire for an amount equal to damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not be made timely.

The SCT may revoke the Concession if KCSM is sanctioned on a specified number of occasions for any of the following: unjustly interrupting the operation of its rail lines or for charging rates higher than those it has registered with the ARTF; unlawfully restricting the ability of other Mexican rail operators to use its rail lines; failing to make payments for damages caused during the performance of services; failing to comply with any term or condition of the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law and regulations or the Concession; failing to make the capital investments required under its three-year business plan filed with the SCT; or failing to maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage as specified in the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law and regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or creates any lien on the Concession, or if there is a change in control of KCSM without the



SCT’s approval. The SCT may also terminate the Concession as a result of KCSM’s surrender of its rights under the Concession, or for reasons of public interest or upon KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy. If the Concession is terminated or revoked by the SCT for any reason, KCSM would receive no compensation and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by it, would revert to the Mexican government. Revocation or termination of the Concession could adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico subject it to economic and political risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise, significant influence over the Mexican economy. Accordingly, Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy and state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on Mexican private sector entities in general and on KCSM’s operations in particular. KCS cannot predict the impact that the political landscape, including multiparty rule and civil disobedience, will have on the Mexican economy. Furthermore, KCS’s consolidated financial statements and prospects may be affected by currency fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation and other political, social and economic developments in or affecting Mexico.

The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. Although Mexico has imposed foreign exchange controls in the past, there are currently no exchange controls in Mexico. Pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange control policy could adversely affect KCS’s ability to obtain U.S. dollars or to convert Mexican pesos (“pesos” or “Ps.”) into dollars for purposes of making payments. This could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

The social and political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican economy and changes in laws, public policies and government programs could be enacted, which could have an adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

Downturns in the United States economy or in trade between the United States and Asia or Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates would likely have adverse effects on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

The level and timing of KCS’s Mexican business activity is heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico and the United States in these markets at any given time, and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the United States or Mexican economies or in trade between the United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on KCS’s consolidated financial statements and the Company’s ability to meet debt service obligations. In addition, KCS has invested significant amounts in developing its intermodal operations, including the Port of Lazaro Cardenas, in part to provide Asian importers with an alternative to the west coast ports of the United States, and the level of intermodal traffic depends, to an extent, on the volume of Asian shipments routed through Lazaro Cardenas. Reduction in trading volumes, which may be caused by factors beyond KCS’s control, including increased government regulations regarding the safety and quality of Asian-manufactured products, may adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

U.S. President Donald J. Trump, certain members of the U.S. House of Representatives, and key U.S. administrative officials and policy makers have suggested renegotiation of NAFTA and the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures that could impact the level of trade between the U.S. and Mexico.  Any such proposal or measure could negatively impact KCS customers and the volume of rail shipments, and could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates could lead to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and commodities KCSM carries.

Severe weakening of the peso against the U.S. dollar may result in disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely



payments of interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness. Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other currencies for the purpose of making timely payments and contractual commitments. Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar prices for KCS’s securities.

Fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rates also have an effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. A weakening of the peso against the U.S. dollar would cause reported peso-denominated revenues and expenses to decrease, and would increase reported foreign exchange loss due to the Company’s net monetary assets that are peso-denominated. Exchange rate variations also affect the calculation of taxes under Mexican income tax law, and a strengthening of the peso against the U.S. dollar would cause an increase in the Company’s cash tax obligation and effective income tax rate.

Severe weather or other natural disasters could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

The Company’s operations may be affected by severe weather or other natural disasters. The Company operates in and along the Gulf of Mexico, and its facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods and other extreme weather conditions that could also adversely affect KCS’s shipping, agricultural, chemical and other customers. Severe weather or other natural disasters could result in significant business interruption and could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s business may be adversely affected by changes in general economic or other conditions.

KCS’s operations may be adversely affected by changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican economies affects the businesses served by KCS. A significant and sustained decrease in crude oil prices could adversely affect the transport of crude oil by rail to the U.S. Gulf region as well as negatively impact railroad volumes related to equipment and other materials that support crude oil production. Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of either or both of the financial and credit markets, including the availability of short and long-term debt financing, may affect KCS, as well as the producers and consumers of the commodities that KCS transports and may have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although transportation markets are affected by general economic conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each particular market that may influence operating results. Some of KCS’s customers do business in industries that are highly cyclical, including the energy, automotive, housing and agriculture industries. Any downturn or change in government policy in these industries could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also, some of the products transported have had a historical pattern of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the general economic environment and by industry capacity and demand. KCS cannot assure that prices and demand for these products will not decline in the future, adversely affecting those industries and, in turn, the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Significant reductions in the volume of rail shipments due to economic or other conditions could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS depends on the stability, availability and security of its information technology systems to operate its business.

KCS relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. A significant disruption or failure of its information technology systems, including its computer hardware, software, communications equipment, wayside equipment or locomotive onboard equipment could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security failures, regulatory compliance failures or other operational difficulties.

The security risks associated with information technology systems have increased in recent years because of the increased sophistication, activities and evolving techniques of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of KCS’s information technology security systems, or those of its third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or unauthorized access to its network could disrupt KCS’s business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, increase its costs and/or cause losses and reputational damage. KCS also confronts the risk that a terrorist or nation-state sponsored group may seek to use its property, including KCS’s information technology systems, to inflict major harm.



A significant disruption, failure or unauthorized access of KCS’s information technology system could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

Capacity constraints could adversely affect service and operating efficiency.

KCS may experience capacity constraints due to increased demand for rail services, unavailability of equipment, crew shortages, or extreme weather. Also, due to the interconnectivity between all railroads, especially in the U.S., congestion on other railroads could result in operational inefficiencies for KCS.

Traffic congestion experienced in the U.S. or Mexican railroad system may result in overall traffic congestion which would impact the ability to move traffic to and from Mexico. In addition, the growth of cross border traffic in recent years has contributed to congestion on the international bridge at the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo border gateway, which is expected to continue in the near future. This could also result in operational inefficiencies for KCS and adversely affect KCS’s operations.

Significant expansions in the capacity of the Company’s network can require a substantial amount of time and investment. Although KCS constantly monitors its network in an effort to optimize its rail services, there can be no assurance that such measures will adequately address capacity constraints on a timely basis.

KCS may be subject to various claims and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company may be exposed to the potential of various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS competes against other railroads and other transportation providers.

The Company’s domestic and international operations are subject to competition from other railroads, as well as from truck carriers, barge lines, and other maritime shippers. Many of KCS’s rail competitors are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than KCS, which may enable rail competitors to reduce rates and make KCS’s freight services less competitive. KCS’s ability to respond to competitive pressures by matching rate reductions and decreasing rates without adversely affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on, among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs. KCS’s failure to respond to competitive pressures, and particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The railroad industry is dominated by a few large carriers. These larger railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to block other railroads’ access to gateways and routing options that are currently and have historically been available. In addition, if there is future consolidation in the railroad industry in the United States or Mexico, there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Trucking, maritime, and barge competitors, while able to provide rate and service competition to the railroad industry, are able to use public rights-of-way, require substantially smaller capital investment and maintenance expenditures than railroads and allow for more frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing competitive pressures, any reduction in margins due to competitive pressures, developments that increase the quality or decrease the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which the Company operates, or legislation or regulations that provide motor carriers with additional advantages, such as increased size of vehicles and reduced weight restrictions, could result in downward pressure on freight rates, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

A key part of KCS’s growth strategy is based upon the conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance the Company will succeed in its efforts to convert traffic from truck to rail transport or that the customers already converted will be retained. If the railroad industry in general is unable to preserve its competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry, revenue growth could be adversely affected. Additionally, revenue growth could be affected by, among other factors, an expansion in the availability, or an improvement in the quality, of the trucking services offered by carriers resulting from regulatory and administrative interpretations and implementation of certain provisions of NAFTA, and KCS’s inability to grow



its existing customer base and capture additional cargo transport market share because of competition from the shipping industry and other railroads.

KCS’s business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties.

Operation of KCS’s rail network and its plans for growth and expansion rely significantly on agreements with other railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other strategic alliances, as well as interchange, trackage rights, haulage rights and marketing agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage the Company does not own. KCS’s ability to provide comprehensive rail service to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to maintain these agreements with other railroads and third parties, and upon the performance of the obligations under the agreements by the other railroads and third parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew, these agreements could adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements. KCS is also dependent in part upon the financial strength and efficient performance of other railroads. There can be no assurance that KCS will not be materially adversely affected by operational or financial difficulties of other railroads.

KCS is subject to environmental regulations, which may impose significant costs on the Company’s business operations.

KCS operations are subject to environmental regulation enacted by federal, state and local legislatures in the U.S. and Mexico. From time to time, certain KCS facilities have not been in compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that KCS will always be in compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. Environmental liability under federal and state law in the United States can also extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. Given the nature of its business, the Company incurs, and expects to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs, including, in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance with requirements governing chemical and hazardous material shipping operations, refueling operations and repair facilities. KCS presently has environmental investigation and remediation obligations at certain sites, and will likely incur such obligations at additional sites in the future.

The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including standards for, among other things, water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. Under applicable Mexican law and regulations, administrative and criminal proceedings may be brought and economic sanctions imposed against companies that violate environmental laws, and non-complying facilities may be temporarily or permanently closed. KCSM is also subject to the laws of various jurisdictions with respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments of each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities are located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government also impose environmental compliance obligations on KCSM. Failure to comply with any environmental laws or regulations may result in the termination of KCSM’s Concession or in fines or penalties that may affect profitability.

Liabilities accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s best estimate of the probable future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites. However, remediation costs may exceed such estimates, due to various factors such as evolving environmental laws and regulations, changes in technology, the extent of other parties’ participation, developments in environmental surveys and studies, and the extent of corrective action that may ultimately be required. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that unidentified environmental matters or the adoption of additional or more stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s inadvertent failure or inability to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and operations, including fines, penalties, or limitations on operating activities until compliance with applicable requirements is achieved. Government entities may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which the Company operates without providing any recourse for any adverse effects on the Company’s business that occur as a result of such change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other authorizations. Any failure to obtain or maintain these licenses, permits, and other authorizations could adversely affect KCS’s business operations.



KCS’s business is vulnerable to fluctuations in fuel costs and disruptions in fuel supplies.

KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and these costs represent a significant portion of its transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel may have a material adverse effect on operating results. If KCS is unable to recapture its costs of fuel from its customers, operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a severe disruption of fuel supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a disruption of oil imports, weather events, war, or otherwise, and the resulting impact on fuel prices could materially adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS currently meets fuel requirements for its Mexican operations through purchases from PEMEX Refinación (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico, and other authorized fuel distributors of PEMEX fuel around the country. If PEMEX were to experience significant operational difficulties not quickly resolved, the Mexican operations could be materially adversely affected.

Weaknesses in the short and long-term debt markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.

Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, the Company regularly relies on debt markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, bank financing and commercial paper. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including debt markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase the cost of financing sources. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings to below investment grade, limiting its access to external sources of capital, and increasing the costs of short and long-term debt financing, and could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s business may be affected by market and regulatory responses to climate change.

KCS’s operations may be adversely affected by restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases, including diesel exhaust. Restrictions on emissions could also affect KCS’s customers that use commodities that KCS transports to produce energy, use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities KCS transports, or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including coal-fired power plants, chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities KCS transports, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain customers and their respective markets for certain commodities KCS transports in an unpredictable manner that could alter traffic patterns, including, for example, the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Any of these factors, individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

A majority of KCS’s employees belong to labor unions. Strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect operations.

The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of

December 31, 2016

, approximately 75% and 80% of KCSR and KCSM Servicios employees, respectively, were covered by labor contracts subject to collective bargaining. The Company may be subject to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of disputes under these collective bargaining agreements and labor contracts or KCS’s potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United States, because such agreements are generally negotiated on an industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond KCS’s control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. If the unionized workers in the United States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown; if other employees were to become unionized or if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of United States railway workers to strike, there is no law in Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway workers in that country to strike.



KCS is dependent on certain key suppliers of core rail equipment.

KCS relies on a limited number of suppliers of core rail equipment (including locomotives, rolling stock equipment, rail and ties). The capital intensive nature and complexity of such equipment creates high barriers of entry for any potential new suppliers. If any of KCS’s suppliers discontinue production or experience capacity or supply shortages, this could result in increased costs or difficulty in obtaining rail equipment and materials, which could have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

The availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect KCS’s operations.

Changes in demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect KCS’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Unforeseen increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on KCS’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on KCS’s consolidated financial statements.

KCS’s business may be affected by future acts of terrorism, war or other acts of violence or crime.

Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s chemical transportation activities, any government response thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’s consolidated financial statements. These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise capital or its future business opportunities. KCS’s rail lines and facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which could cause significant business interruption and damage to KCS’s property. In recent years, there have been reported incidents of train-related robberies in Mexico, including incidents involving KCSM’s trains and infrastructure. Other acts of violence or crime could also adversely affect the Company’s business.

As a result, acts of terrorism or war or acts of crime or violence could result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues for KCS. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the applicable coverage currently maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be adequate to cover losses or may not be available in the future.

Properties

Track Configuration

KCSR operates over a railroad system consisting of approximately 3,400 route miles in ten states extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United States south to the Mexican border, which includes approximately 635 miles of trackage rights that permit KCSR to operate its trains with its crews over other railroads’ tracks.

Under its Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM has the right to operate approximately 3,200 route miles, but does not own the land, roadway, or associated structures, and additionally has approximately 550 miles of trackage rights. The Concession requires KCSM to make investments as described in a business plan filed every three years with the Mexican government. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors — KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in certain circumstances which would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad and would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.”

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Financial Overview

Revenues in


decreased

3%

from


, due to a

2%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit and carload/unit volumes.

Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge, partially offset by positive pricing impacts. Energy revenue decreased by

$49.6 million

due to lower volumes in crude oil as a result of low crude oil spreads and increased pipeline capacity. Volumes also decreased as the decline in new crude drilling operations in the U.S. has reduced the demand for frac sand. In addition, low natural gas prices and high coal inventory levels reduced the demand for utility coal in 2016.

Operating expenses decreased

6%

compared to


, due to a

$62.8 million

Mexican fuel excise tax credit recognized in 2016, the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices. Expense reductions resulting from the weakening Mexican peso and lower fuel prices largely offset the revenue reductions driven by these same macroeconomic factors. These expense reductions were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and increased depreciation expense. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to

64.9%

in 2016 from 66.8% in 2015.

In 2016, the Company invested

$584.0 million

in capital expenditures. In addition, the Company purchased

$26.6 million

of equipment under existing operating leases or replacement equipment as certain operating leases expired, which was primarily funded with internally generated cash flows and short-term borrowings.



The Company reported


earnings of

$4.43

per diluted share on consolidated net income attributable to Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries of

$478.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to annual earnings of

$4.40

per diluted share on consolidated net income attributable to Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries of

$483.5 million

for


.

During 2016, KCS repurchased

2,127,612

shares of common stock for

$185.4 million

at an average price of

$87.15

per share under the

$500.0 million

share repurchase program announced in May 2015. Since inception of this program, KCS has repurchased

4,261,596

shares of common stock for

$379.6 million

at an average price of

$89.07

per share. Management's assessment of market conditions, available liquidity and other factors will determine the timing and volume of any future repurchases.

On May 16, 2016, KCS issued $250.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 3.125%. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding commercial paper issued by KCS and for other general corporate purposes.

On October 28, 2016, $250.0 million principal amount of outstanding floating rate senior notes issued by KCS and KCSM matured and were redeemed by the Company at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount using available cash on hand and commercial paper.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended

December 31, 2016

, compared with the Year Ended

December 31, 2015

The following summarizes KCS’s consolidated income statement components

(in millions):

Revenues

The following summarizes revenues

(in millions),

carload/unit statistics

(in thousands)

and revenue per carload/unit:

Revenues include revenue for transportation services and fuel surcharges. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, revenues and carload/unit volumes decreased

3%

and

2%

, respectively, compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased by $66.0 million or approximately 3%, compared to the prior year, due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for revenue transactions denominated in Mexican pesos. The average exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar was Ps.18.7 for 2016 compared to Ps.15.8 for 2015.



Revenue per carload/unit decreased by

2%

for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge, partially offset by positive pricing impacts.

KCS’s fuel surcharges are a mechanism to adjust revenue based upon changes in fuel prices above fuel price thresholds set in KCS’s tariffs or contracts. Fuel surcharge revenue is calculated using a fuel price from a prior time period that can be up to 60 days earlier. In a period of volatile fuel prices or changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel surcharge revenue may differ.

Fuel surcharge revenue decreased

$126.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to the prior year, due in part to the adjustment of certain line haul rates while reducing or eliminating fuel surcharges on those rates. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue decreased due to lower U.S. fuel prices and the impact of fuel prices falling below fuel price thresholds for certain of KCS’s tariffs and contracts during 2016.

The following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by commodity group:

Revenues by commodity

group for


Chemical and petroleum.

Reven

ues increas

ed $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, due to a 1% increase in revenue per carload/unit. Revenue per carload/unit increased due to

positive pricing impacts and mix, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge and the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Plastic volumes increased due to strong market demand and low commodity pricing environment and petroleum volumes increased as a result of several customers’ business expansion. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in chemical volumes due to oversupply caused by low natural gas prices that drove fertilizer prices down and a customer’s lost business.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues decreased $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, due to a 2% decrease in revenue per carload/unit and a 1% decrease in carload/unit volumes. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge, partially offset by positive pricing impacts. Paper volumes decreased due to competitive trucking market, global softness in the market, and high inventory levels.



Revenues by commodity

group for


Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues increased $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, due to a 5% increase in carload/unit volumes and a 2% increase in revenue per carload/unit. Grain and food product volumes increased due to improved cycle times. In addition, grain volumes increased due to additional equipment capacity, partially offset by a decrease in ores and minerals volumes due to weather related issues in the southeast region of the United States. Revenue per carload/unit increased due to longer average length of haul and mix, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge and the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.

Energy.

Revenues decreased $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, due to an 11% decrease in revenue per carload/unit and a 10% decrease in carload/unit volumes. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to shorter average length of haul and lower fuel surcharge. Volumes decreased as low natural gas prices and high coal inventory levels reduced the demand for utility coal in 2016. In addition, crude oil volumes decreased as result of low crude oil spreads and increased pipeline capacity, and the decline in new crude drilling operations in the U.S. has reduced the demand for frac sand.

Intermodal.

Revenues decreased

$23.9 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to a

4%

decrease in carload/unit volumes and a

3%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit. Volumes decreased due to service disruptions related to the flooding in the southeastern United States earlier in the year and protests in Mexico during July of 2016, increased truck conversion, and high retail inventory levels. Revenue per carload/unit decreased as a result of pricing impacts and shorter average length of haul.

Automotive.

Revenues decreased

$28.8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to an

18%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit, partially offset by a

5%

increase in carload/unit volumes. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge. Volumes increased due to 2015 service-related issues and new customers in 2016, partially offset by customers’ temporary plant shutdowns in the first half of 2016.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses, as shown below (

in millions

), decreased

$99.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to the Mexican fuel excise tax credit, the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, lower fuel prices and purchased services, and lease termination costs recognized in 2015, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and increased depreciation expense. The weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar resulted in an expense reduction of approximately $63.0 million or 4% for expense transactions denominated in Mexican pesos. The average exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar was Ps.18.7 for


compared to Ps.15.8 for


.

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and benefits increased

$20.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to higher incentive compensation of approximately $34.0 million and annual wage increases of approximately $14.0 million. Incentive compensation increased due to higher expected achievement of short and long-term incentive performance targets in 2016, as compared to 2015. These increases were partially offset by the weakening of the Mexican peso of approximately $19.0 million compared to 2015, and lower U.S. labor costs of approximately $15.0 million due to reduced volumes and increased productivity.

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense decreased

$14.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to car repair in Mexico being performed in-house starting in October 2016 and the weakening of the Mexican peso.

Fuel.

Fuel expense decreased

$53.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to the weakening of the Mexican peso of approximately $28.0 million and lower diesel fuel prices of approximately $18.0 million and $4.0 million in the U.S. and Mexico, respectively. The average price per gallon, inclusive of the impact from the weakening of the Mexican peso, was $1.95 in


, compared to $2.32 in


. In addition, fuel expense decreased due to improved fuel efficiency and lower fuel consumption.

Mexican fuel excise tax credit.

The Mexican fuel excise tax is used by the Mexican government to control fuel price. Mexico is transitioning to market-based fuel pricing, and the transition is expected to be complete by the end of 2017. The implementation of a 2016 fuel excise tax credit for the Mexico railroad industry effectively moved the industry to market-based pricing in 2016.

For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the Company recognized a

$62.8 million

credit available under changes in Mexican law for the excise tax included in the price of fuel that is purchased and consumed in locomotives and certain work equipment in Mexico. The Mexican fuel excise tax credit is realized through the offset of the total 2016 Mexico income tax liability and income tax withholding payment obligations of KCSM.  Recently enacted legislation extended the fuel excise tax credit to Mexican railroads in 2017.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased $0.6 million for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to higher car hire expense due to volume mix, partially offset by lower lease expense as a result of the purchase of equipment under existing operating leases and replacement equipment as certain operating leases expired.



Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased

$20.4 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to a larger asset base.

Materials and other.

Materials and other expense was flat for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


.

Lease termination costs.

Lease termination costs were

$9.6 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, due to the early termination of certain operating leases and the related purchase of the equipment. The Company did not incur lease termination costs for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

Non-Operating Expenses

Equity in net earnings of affiliates.

Equity in net earnings from affiliates decreased

$3.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to

Interest expense

. Interest expense increased

$15.8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to higher average debt balances and average interest rates as a result of the Company’s issuance of debt during the third quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2016. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, the average debt balance (including short-term borrowings) was

$2,492.7 million

Foreign exchange loss.

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, foreign exchange loss was

$72.0 million

and

$56.6 million

, respectively. Foreign exchange loss includes the re-measurement and settlement of net monetary assets denominated in Mexican pesos and the loss on foreign currency derivative contracts.

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, the re-measurement and settlement of net monetary assets denominated in Mexican pesos resulted in a foreign exchange loss of

$18.5 million

and

$9.4 million

, respectively.

, foreign exchange loss on foreign currency derivative contracts was

$53.5 million

and

$47.2 million

, respectively.

Other expense, net.

Other expense, net, decreased

$2.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to lower miscellaneous expenses.

Income tax expense.

Income tax expense decreased

$4.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, compared to


, due to lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was

27.6%

and

27.8%

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the more significant weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar in


, as compared to


.

The weakening of the Mexican peso during 2016 and 2015 decreased the Company’s Mexican cash tax obligation by $49.2 million and $46.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge its net exposure to fluctuations in the Mexican cash tax obligation due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, and losses on these foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded in foreign exchange loss.

(in millions):

Revenues

The following summarizes revenues

(in millions),

carload/unit statistics

(in thousands)

and revenue per carload/unit:

Revenues include both revenue for transportation services and fuel surcharges. For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, revenues and carload/unit volumes decreased

6%

and

3%

, respectively, compared to the prior year. Revenue decreased by $79.0 million or approximately 3% due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for revenue transactions denominated in Mexican pesos. The average exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar was Ps.15.8 for 2015, compared to Ps.13.3 for 2014.



Revenue per carload/unit decreased by

4%

for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to lower fuel surcharge and the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by positive pricing impacts.

KCS’s fuel surcharges are a mechanism to adjust revenue based upon changes in fuel prices above fuel price thresholds set in KCS’s tariffs or contracts. Fuel surcharge revenue is calculated using a fuel price from a prior time period that can be up to 60 days earlier. In a period of volatile fuel prices or changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel surcharge revenue may differ.

Fuel surcharge revenue decreased $104.6 million for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to the prior year, due to lower U.S. fuel prices.

The following discussion provides an analysis of revenues by commodity group:

Revenues by commodity

group for


Chemical and petroleum.

Revenues increased $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, due to a 5% increase in carload/unit volumes. Petroleum volumes increased as a result of new business and plastics volumes increased due to lower commodity prices. Revenue per carload/unit was flat for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, as positive pricing impacts were offset by the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower fuel surcharge.

Industrial and consumer products.

Revenues decreased $52.9

million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, due to an 8% decrease in carload/unit volumes and a 1% decrease in revenue per carload/unit. Metals and scrap volumes decreased due to the decline in new drilling operations in the U.S. and higher imports from foreign sources. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to lower fuel surcharge and the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by positive pricing impacts.



Revenues by commodity

group for


Agriculture and minerals.

Revenues decreased $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, due to a 6%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit, partially offset by a 2% increase in carload/unit volumes. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to lower fuel surcharge and the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Food products volumes increased as a result of a customer's temporary plant shutdown during the third quarter of 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in grain volumes due to service-related issues in the second and third quarters of 2015.

Energy.

Revenues decreased $74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, due to an 18% decrease in revenue per carload/unit and a 6% decrease in carload/unit volumes. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to lower fuel surcharge, a short-term rate concession provided to a customer during the second half of 2015 and shorter average length of haul. Volumes decreased as low natural gas prices reduced the demand for utility coal and the decline in new crude drilling operations in the U.S. reduced the demand for frac sand. These decreases were partially offset by increased crude oil volumes due to new business.

Intermodal.

Revenues decreased

$14.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to a 3% decrease in in carload/unit volumes and a

1%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit. Lower volumes due to service-related issues in the second and third quarters of 2015 and the conversion of rail traffic to truck were partially offset by volume growth driven by trans-Pacific imports via the Port of Lazaro Cardenas. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to lower fuel surcharge.

Automotive.

Revenues decreased

$19.7 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, due to an

8%

decrease in revenue per carload/unit. Revenue per carload/unit decreased due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by positive pricing impacts. Volumes were flat for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to 2014, due to service-related issues in the second and third quarters of 2015.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses, as shown below (

in millions

), decreased

$153.0 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to the weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and lower U.S. fuel prices, partially offset by increased depreciation expense. The weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar resulted in an expense reduction of approximately $77.0 million for expense transactions denominated in Mexican pesos. The average exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar was Ps.15.8 for 2015 compared to Ps.13.3 for 2014. Lower U.S. fuel prices reduced 2015 expenses by $71.5 million.

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and benefits decreased

$32.3 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to the weakening of the Mexican peso of approximately $23.0 million, lower incentive compensation of $22.4 million and a reduction in post-employment liabilities due to changes in discount rates. These decreases were partially offset by annual salary rate increases and a 3% growth in headcount.

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense decreased

$22.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to renegotiation of maintenance contracts during 2015, the weakening of the Mexican peso and lower track maintenance and corporate expenses.

Fuel.

Fuel expense decreased

$109.0 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to lower U.S. diesel fuel prices of $71.5 million and the weakening of the Mexican peso of approximately $37.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $12.0 million increase due to Mexican diesel prices. The average price per gallon, inclusive of the impact from the weakening of the Mexican peso, was $2.32 in 2015, compared to $3.03 in 2014. In addition, fuel expense decreased due to improved fuel efficiency and lower fuel consumption.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased

$0.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, primarily due to higher car hire expense due to longer cycle times, partially offset by lower lease expense as a result of the purchase of equipment under existing operating leases and replacement equipment as certain operating leases expired.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization increased

$26.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to a larger asset base, including the purchase of equipment under existing operating leases and replacement equipment as certain operating leases expired.

Materials and other.

Materials and other increased

$12.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to an increase in materials and supplies, derailment expense, property taxes, environmental expense and the settlement of a litigation dispute during 2015. These increases were partially offset by the weakening of the Mexican peso, lower employee expenses and a reduction in personal injury expense recognized during 2015 as a result of changes in estimates due to favorable claim experience

Lease termination costs.

Lease termination costs were

$9.6 million

and

$38.3 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively, due to the early termination of certain operating leases and the related purchase of the equipment.



Non-Operating Expenses

Equity in net earnings of affiliates.

Equity in net earnings from affiliates decreased

$2.8 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


. Equity in net earnings from the operations of Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. decreased due to higher operating expenses. In addition, equity in net earnings from the operations of Panama Canal Railway Company decreased due to lower container volumes.

Interest expense.

Interest expense increased

$9.1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to higher average interest rates and average debt balances as a result of the Company’s issuance of debt during the third quarter of 2015. For the year ended

December 31, 2015

, the average debt balance (including short-term borrowings) was

$2,257.8 million

, compared to

$2,174.7 million

in


. The average interest rate for the year ended

December 31, 2015

was

3.7%

, compared to

3.5%

in


.

Debt retirement and exchange costs.

Debt retirement and exchange costs were

$7.6 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, related to costs that were payable to parties other than the debt holders as a result of the KCSR and KCSM senior notes exchanged for KCS senior notes. For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, debt retirement and exchange costs were

$6.6 million

related to the call premiums, original issue discounts and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Company’s various debt redemption activities.

Foreign exchange loss.

For the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, foreign exchange loss was

$56.6 million

and

$35.5 million

, respectively. Foreign exchange loss includes the re-measurement and settlement of net monetary assets denominated in Mexican pesos and the loss on foreign currency derivative contracts.

For the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, the re-measurement and settlement of net monetary assets denominated in Mexican pesos resulted in a foreign exchange loss of

$9.4 million

and

$7.6 million

, respectively.

The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge its net exposure to fluctuations in the Mexican cash tax obligation due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. For the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, foreign exchange loss on foreign currency derivative contracts was

$47.2 million

and

$27.9 million

, respectively.

Other expense, net.

Other expense, net, increased

$1.2 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to lower miscellaneous income.

Income tax expense.

Income tax expense decreased

$21.5 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2015

, compared to


, due to lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate was

27.8%

and

29.3%

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the more significant weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar in 2015 as compared to 2014.

The weakening of the Mexican peso during 2015 and 2014 decreased the cash tax obligation by $46.4 million and $27.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge its net exposure to fluctuations in the Mexican cash tax obligation due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, and losses on these foreign currency derivative contracts are recorded in foreign exchange loss.

to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

The Company focuses its cash and capital resources on investing in the business, shareholder returns and optimizing its capital structure.

The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets, and other available financing resources will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service costs, dividends, share repurchases and other commitments in the foreseeable



future. The Company may, from time to time, incur debt to refinance existing indebtedness, purchase equipment under operating leases, repurchase shares or fund equipment additions or new investments.

During


, the Company invested

$584.0 million

in capital expenditures and purchased

$26.6 million

of equipment under existing operating leases or replacement equipment as certain operating leases expired.

During


, KCS repurchased

2,127,612

shares of common stock for

$185.4 million

at an average price of

$87.15

per share under the

$500.0 million

share repurchase program announced in May 2015. Since inception of this program, KCS has repurchased

4,261,596

shares of common stock for

$379.6 million

at an average price of

$89.07

per share. Remaining share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt. Management's assessment of market conditions, available liquidity and other factors will determine the timing and volume of any future repurchases.

During the first quarter of 2016, KCS entered into agreements with certain holders of KCSR and KCSM senior notes to exchange approximately $55.6 million of existing KCSR and KCSM senior notes for new securities issued by KCS with the same interest rates, interest payment dates and maturity dates and substantially identical redemption provisions as the corresponding existing senior note.

On May 16, 2016, KCS issued $250.0 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of 3.125%. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding commercial paper issued by KCS and for other general corporate purposes.

On October 28, 2016, $250.0 million principal amount of outstanding floating rate senior notes issued by KCS and KCSM matured and were redeemed by the Company at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount using available cash on hand and commercial paper.

The Company’s current financing instruments contain restrictive covenants which limit or preclude certain actions; however, the covenants are structured such that the Company expects to have sufficient flexibility to conduct its operations. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of

December 31, 2016

.

For discussion regarding the agreements representing the indebtedness of KCS, see “Note


, Short-Term Borrowings” and “Note


, Long-Term Debt” in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of this annual report on Form 10-K.

During


, the Company’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.33 per share or

$141.9 million

on its common stock. On

January 26, 2017

, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of

$0.33

per share payable on

April 5, 2017

, to common stockholders of record as of

March 13, 2017

. Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors, capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in the best interest of its stockholders, the Company intends to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis.

On

December 31, 2016

, total available liquidity (the cash balance plus revolving credit facility availability) was

$789.2 million

, compared to available liquidity at

December 31, 2015

of $856.6 million.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the total cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in foreign subsidiaries was

$133.0 million

. The Company expects that this cash will be available to fund company operations without incurring significant additional income taxes.

KCS’s operating results and financing alternatives can be unexpectedly impacted by various factors, some of which are outside of its control. For example, if KCS were to experience a reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities, its earnings could be significantly reduced, increasing the risk of non-compliance with debt covenants. Additionally, the Company is subject to external factors impacting debt and equity capital markets and its ability to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions. Volatility in capital markets and the tightening of market liquidity could impact KCS’s access to capital. Further, KCS’s cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating agencies which assign debt ratings based on certain factors including competitive position, credit measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios, and liquidity.



Cash Flow Information and Contractual Obligations

Summary cash flow data follows

(in millions):

During


, cash and cash equivalents increased

$34.0 million

as a result of the impacts discussed in the paragraphs below. During


, cash and cash equivalents decreased

$211.4 million

as a result of the repurchase of common stock of $194.2 million and higher dividend payments.

Operating Cash Flows.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased

$4.0 million

for


, as compared to


, due to an increase in cash inflows from working capital items resulting mainly from the timing of certain payments, partially offset by the 2016 Mexican fuel excise tax credit, for which cash will be received in 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased

$3.3 million

for


, as compared to 2014, as a decrease in net income was more than offset by higher non-cash depreciation and amortization expense and unrealized foreign exchange loss on foreign currency contracts. Additionally, materials and supplies increased due to timing of construction activities and fuel purchases.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net cash used for investing activities decreased

$244.8 million

for


, as compared to


, due to reduced capital expenditures and reduced expenditures for the purchase or replacement of equipment under existing operating leases. Net cash used for investing activities decreased

$109.9 million

for


, as compared to 2014, due to reduced expenditures for the purchase or replacement of equipment under existing operating leases, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and other investing activities. Additional capital expenditure information is included within the Capital Expenditure section of Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows are generated from the issuance of long-term debt, short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Financing cash outflows are used for the repayment of debt, short-term borrowings, share repurchases and the payment of dividends and debt costs. Financing cash flows for


,


, and


are discussed in more detail below:

•

Net financing cash outflows for


were

$251.1 million

due to the the repurchase of common stock of

$185.4 million

, the payment of dividends of

$142.8 million

and the net repayment of long-term debt of $27.7 million, partially offset by the net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $100.8 million.

•

Net financing cash outflows for


were

$247.7 million

due to the net repayment of short-term borrowings of

$371.1 million, the repurchase of common stock of $194.2 million, the payment of dividends of

$140.1 million

and the payment of debt costs of $20.3 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $473.9 million.

•

Net financing cash outflows for


were

$4.6 million

due to the the net repayment of $333.0 million of long-term debt and the payment of

$116.6 million

of dividends, offset by the net proceeds of $448.6 million from short-term borrowings.



Contractual Obligations.

The following table outlines the material obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2016

(in millions):

_____________________

(i)

For variable rate obligations, interest payments were calculated using the December 31, 2016 rate. For fixed rate obligations, interest payments were calculated based on the applicable rates and payment dates.

(ii)

For amounts where the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, obligations due to uncertainty in income taxes are included in the Other column.

(iii)

Capital expenditure obligations include minimum capital expenditures under the KCSM Concession agreement and other regulatory requirements.

(iv)

Other contractual obligations include purchase commitments and certain maintenance agreements.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into long-term contractual commitments for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity. Such commitments are not included in the above table.

The Company is party to four utilization leases covering 616 railcars in which car hire revenue as defined in the lease agreements is shared between the lessor and the Company. The leases expire at various times through 2024. Amounts that may be due to lessors under these utilization leases vary from month to month based on car hire rental with the minimum monthly cost to the Company being zero. Accordingly, the utilization leases have been excluded from contractual obligations above.

The SCT previously required KCSM to submit a five-year capital expenditures plan every five years. As a result of new regulation in 2016, the SCT requires KCSM to submit a three-year capital expenditures plan every three years, once the most recent plan expires. The most recent five-year plan was submitted in 2012 for the years 2013 — 2017. KCSM expects to continue capital spending at current levels in future years and will continue to have capital expenditure obligations past 2017, which are not included in the table above.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

On November 2, 2007, PCRC completed an offering of $100.0 million of 7.0% senior secured notes due November 1, 2026 (the “Notes”). The Notes are senior obligations of PCRC, secured by certain assets of PCRC. KCS has pledged its shares of PCRC as security for the Notes. The Notes are otherwise non-recourse to KCS. The Company has agreed, along with Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), the other 50% owner of PCRC, to each fund one-half of any debt service reserve and liquidity reserve (reserves which are required to be established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the Notes). As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s portion of these reserves was

$5.5 million

. The Company has issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of

$5.5 million

to fund its share of these reserves.



Capital Expenditures

KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund, capital expenditures with operating cash flows and short and long-term debt.

The following table summarizes capital expenditures by type for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, respectively

(in millions):

Generally, the Company’s capital program consists of capital replacement and equipment. For


, internally generated cash flows and short-term borrowings are expected to fund cash capital expenditures, which are currently estimated to be between $550.0 million and $560.0 million. In addition, the Company periodically reviews its equipment under operating leases. Any additional purchase or replacement of equipment under operating leases during 2017 is expected to be funded with internally generated cash flows and/or short-term debt.

Property Statistics

The following table summarizes certain property statistics as of December 31:

Shelf Registration Statements and Public Securities Offerings

KCS has one current, universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC (the “Universal Shelf” — Registration No. 333-200411). The Universal Shelf was filed on November 20, 2014 in accordance with the securities offering reform rules of the SEC that allow “well-known seasoned issuers” to register an unspecified amount of different types of securities on an immediately effective Form S-3 registration statement. The Universal Shelf will expire on November 20, 2017.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’s accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to an understanding of KCS’s historical and future performance. Management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of KCS’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates.

Capitalization, Depreciation and Amortization of Property and Equipment (including Concession Assets)

Due to the highly capital intensive nature of the railroad industry, capitalization and depreciation of property and equipment are a substantial portion of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Net property and equipment, including concession assets, comprised approximately

92%

of the Company’s total assets as of

December 31, 2016

, and related depreciation and amortization comprised approximately

20%

of total operating expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

KCS capitalizes costs for self-constructed additions and improvements to property including direct labor and material, indirect overhead costs, and interest during long-term construction projects. Direct costs are charged to capital projects based on the work performed and the material used. Indirect overhead costs are allocated to capital projects as a standard percentage, which is evaluated annually, and applied to direct labor and material costs. Asset removal activities are performed in conjunction with replacement activities; therefore, removal costs are estimated based on a standard percentage of direct labor and indirect overhead costs related to capital replacement projects. For purchased assets, all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are capitalized. Expenditures that significantly increase asset values, productive capacity, efficiency, safety or extend useful lives are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated primarily on the group method of depreciation, which the Company believes closely approximates a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets measured in years. The group method of depreciation applies a composite rate to classes of similar assets rather than to individual assets. Composite depreciation rates are based upon the Company’s estimates of the expected average useful lives of assets as well as expected net salvage value at the end of their useful lives. In developing these estimates, the Company utilizes periodic depreciation studies performed by an independent engineering firm. Depreciation rate studies are performed at least every three years for equipment and at least every six years for road property (rail, ties, ballast, etc.). The depreciation studies take into account factors such as:

•

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each asset class;

•

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for the continued use of the assets;

•

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and

•

Historical and expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

The depreciation studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful lives of the affected asset class, as determined by the study. The Company also monitors these factors in non-study years to determine if adjustments should be made to depreciation rates. The Company completed depreciation studies for KCSM in 2016 and KCSR in 2015. The impacts of the studies were immaterial to the consolidated financial results for all periods.

Also under the group method of depreciation, the cost of railroad property and equipment (net of salvage or sales proceeds) retired or replaced in the normal course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Actual historical costs are retired when available, such as with equipment costs. The use of estimates in recording the retirement of roadway assets is necessary as it is impractical to track individual, homogeneous network-type assets. Certain types of roadway assets are retired using statistical curves derived from the depreciation studies that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired. For other roadway assets, historical costs are estimated by (1) deflating current costs



using inflation indices published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and (2) the estimated useful life of the assets as determined by the depreciation studies. The indices applied to the replacement value are selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the items comprising the roadway assets. Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of assets is completely retired, the Company continually monitors the estimated useful lives of its assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset group to ensure the depreciation rates are appropriate.

Estimation of the average useful lives of assets and net salvage values requires management judgment. Estimated average useful lives may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies and other factors that could have an impact on the retirement experience of the asset classes. Accordingly, changes in the assets’ estimated useful lives could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was

$305.0 million

. If the weighted average useful lives of assets were changed by one year, annual depreciation and amortization expense would change approximately $11.0 million.

Gains or losses on dispositions of land or non-group property and abnormal retirements of railroad property are recognized through income. A retirement of railroad property would be considered abnormal if the cause of the retirement is unusual in nature and its actual life is significantly shorter than what would be expected for that group based on the depreciation studies. An abnormal retirement could cause the Company to re-evaluate the estimated useful life of the impacted asset class. There were no significant gains or losses from abnormal retirements of property or equipment for any of the three years ended December 31, 2016.

Costs incurred by the Company to acquire the concession rights and related assets, as well as subsequent improvements to the concession assets, are capitalized and amortized using the group method of depreciation over the lesser of the current expected Concession term, including probable renewal of an additional 50-year term, or the estimated useful lives of the assets and rights. The Company’s ongoing evaluation of the useful lives of concession assets and rights considers the aggregation of the following facts and circumstances:

•

The Company’s executive management is dedicated to ensuring compliance with the various provisions of the Concession and to maintaining positive relationships with the SCT and other Mexican federal, state, and municipal governmental authorities;

•

During the time since the Concession was granted, the relationships between KCSM and the various Mexican governmental authorities have matured and the guidelines for operating under the Concession have become more defined with experience;

•

There are no known supportable sanctions or compliance issues that would cause the SCT to revoke the Concession or prevent KCSM from renewing the Concession; and

•

KCSM operations are an integral part of the KCS operations strategy, and related investment analyses and operational decisions assume that the Company’s cross border rail business operates into perpetuity, and do not assume that Mexico operations terminate at the end of the current Concession term.

Based on the above factors, as of

December 31, 2016

, the Company continues to believe that it is probable that the Concession will be renewed for an additional 50-year term beyond the current term.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value would be reduced to the estimated fair value. Future cash flow estimates for an impairment review would be based on the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which are the Company’s U.S. and Mexican operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, management did not identify any indicators of impairment.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes represent a net asset or liability of the Company. For financial reporting purposes, management determines the current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred



into the future. Currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to the Company’s U.S., state and foreign income tax returns for the current year and anticipated tax payments resulting from income tax audits, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of net deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the estimated timing of reversal of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time these differences are expected to reverse. Additionally, management estimates whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized.

Income tax expense related to Mexican operations has additional complexities such as the impact of exchange rate variations, which can have a significant impact on the effective income tax rate.

Management believes that the assumptions and estimates related to the provision for income taxes are critical to the Company’s results of operations. For the year ended

December 31, 2016

, income tax expense totaled

$182.8 million

. For every 1% change in the


effective rate, income tax expense would have changed by approximately $6.6 million. For further information on the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation on income taxes, refer to Foreign Exchange Sensitivity in

Item 7A.

OTHER MATTERS

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations. Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by current and former employees for job related injuries and by third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS aggressively defends these matters and has established liability provisions that management believes are adequate to cover expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s management, other than those proceedings described in Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Inflation.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost, which does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property. Due to the capital intensive nature of KCS’s business, the replacement cost of these assets would be significantly higher than the amounts reported under the historical cost basis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Refer to Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form

10-K for information relative to recent accounting pronouncements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain inherent market risks. These instruments have been entered into for hedging rather than trading purposes. The following information, together with information included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Floating-rate indebtedness includes commercial paper borrowings, revolving credit facilities and floating rate senior notes which totaled $181.4 million and $330.0 million at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. Considering the balance of $181.4 million of variable rate debt at

December 31, 2016

, KCS is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense of $1.8 million on an annualized basis for the floating-rate instruments issued by the Company as of

December 31, 2016

.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was approximately

$2,303.8 million

and

$2,287.5 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, compared with a carrying value of

$2,296.9 million

and

$2,321.1 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

Commodity Price Sensitivity.

KCS periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitments and derivative financial instruments. At

December 31, 2016

and


, KCS did not have any outstanding fuel derivative financial instruments. The Company also holds fuel inventories for use in operations. These inventories are not material to KCS’s overall financial position. Fuel costs are expected to reflect market conditions in


; however, fuel costs are unpredictable and subject to a variety of factors outside the Company’s control. Assuming annual consumption of 130 million gallons, a 10 cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause a $13.0 million change in operating expenses. KCS mitigates the impact of increased fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from customers; however, in a period of volatile fuel prices or changing customer business mix, changes in fuel expense and fuel surcharge revenue may differ.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity.

KCS’s foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency; however, a portion of the foreign subsidiaries’ revenues and expenses are denominated in Mexican pesos. Based on the volume of revenue and expense transactions denominated in Mexican pesos, revenue and expense fluctuations have historically offset.

The Company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar due to its net monetary assets that are denominated in Mexican pesos. The Company had Ps.2,168.4 million of net monetary assets at

December 31, 2016

.

The following table presents an estimate of the impact to the consolidated statements of income that would result from a hypothetical change in the exchange rate of one Mexican peso at

December 31, 2016

:

Mexican income taxes are paid in Mexican pesos, and as a result, the effective income tax rate reflects fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Most significantly, any gain or loss from the revaluation of the Company’s net U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities into Mexican pesos is included in Mexican taxable income under Mexican tax law. As a result, a strengthening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for the reporting period will generally increase the Mexican cash tax obligation and the effective income tax rate, and a weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for the reporting period will generally decrease the Mexican cash tax obligation and the effective tax rate.



The following table presents an estimate of the impact to the effective income tax rate and income tax expense that would result from a hypothetical change in the exchange rate of one Mexican peso at

December 31, 2016

:

The Company has and may continue to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in the Mexican cash tax obligation due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of

$340.0 million

. These contracts matured on

January 17, 2017

, and obligated the Company to purchase a total of

$6,207.7 million

at a weighted-average exchange rate of

Ps.18.26

to each U.S. dollar. During January 2017, the Company entered into offsetting contracts with an aggregate notional amount of

$287.0 million

. These offsetting contracts matured on

January 17, 2017

, and obligated the Company to sell a total of

Ps.6,207.7 million

at a weighted-average exchange rate of

Ps.21.63

to each U.S. dollar.

During January 2017, the Company entered into foreign currency option contracts known as zero-cost collars with an aggregate notional amount of $380.0 million to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in the Mexican cash tax obligation due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The zero-cost collar contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $130.0 million and $250.0 million will mature on April 25, 2017 and January 16, 2018, respectively. The zero-cost collar contracts have a weighted-average rate of Ps.21.61 to each U.S. dollar for the Mexican peso call options purchased by KCS and a weighted-average rate of Ps.23.87 to each U.S. dollar for the Mexican peso put options sold by KCS.

The Company has not designated these foreign currency derivative instruments as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The foreign currency derivative instruments will be measured at fair value each period and any change in fair value will be recognized in foreign exchange gain (loss) within the consolidated statements of income.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). KCS’s internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013)

(commonly referred to as the COSO Framework). Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the criteria outlined in the COSO Framework.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which immediately follows this report.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited Kansas City Southern’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Kansas City Southern maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Description of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with principal operations in rail transportation.

The Company is engaged primarily in the freight rail transportation business operating through a single coordinated rail network under one reportable business segment. The Company generates revenues and cash flows by providing its customers with freight delivery services both within its regions, and throughout North America through connections with other Class I rail carriers. KCS’s customers conduct business in a number of different industries, including electric-generating utilities, chemical and petroleum products, paper and forest products, agriculture and mineral products, automotive products and intermodal transportation.

The primary subsidiaries of the Company consist of the following:

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. KCSR is a U.S. Class I railroad that services the midwest and southeast regions of the United States;

•

Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”), a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary which operates under the rights granted by the Concession acquired from the Mexican government in 1997 (the “Concession”) as described below;

•

Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”), a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary; which wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”);

•

KCSM Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM Servicios”), a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary which provides employee services to KCSM;

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a

seventy percent

-owned consolidated affiliate. MSLLC owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway”.

Including equity investments in:

•

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), a

fifty percent

-owned unconsolidated affiliate which provides ocean to ocean freight and passenger services along the Panama Canal;

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (“FTVM”), a

twenty-five percent

-owned unconsolidated affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary services in the greater Mexico City area; and

•

PTC-220, LLC (“PTC-220”), a

fourteen percent

-owned unconsolidated affiliate that holds the licenses to large blocks of radio spectrum and other assets for the deployment of positive train control.

The KCSM Concession.

KCSM holds a concession from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusive service through 2027, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires), which is renewable under certain conditions for an additional period of up to

50 years

(the “Concession”). The Concession is to provide freight transportation services over north-east rail lines which are a primary commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system. KCSM has the right to use, but does not own, all track and buildings that are necessary for the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is required to pay the Mexican government an annual concession duty equal to

1.25%

of gross revenues during the Concession period.

Employees and Labor Relations.

KCSR participates in industry-wide multi-employer bargaining as a member of the National Carriers’ Conference Committee, as well as local bargaining for agreements that are limited to KCSR's property. Approximately

75%

of KCSR employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

KCSM Servicios union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which was signed on April 16, 2012, between KCSM Servicios and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana (“Mexican Railroad Union”), for an indefinite period of time, for the purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties. Approximately

80%

of KCSM Servicios employees are covered by this labor agreement.

Union labor negotiations have not historically resulted in any strike, boycott, or other disruption in the Company’s business operations.

. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented using the accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not a controlling interest. The Company evaluates less-than-majority-owned investments for consolidation pursuant to consolidation and variable interest entity guidance. The Company does not have any less-than-majority-owned investments requiring consolidation.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, litigation provisions, and income taxes. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes freight revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a commodity movement as a shipment moves from origin to destination, with the related expense recognized as incurred. Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the product is shipped, as services are performed or contractual obligations are fulfilled.

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss).

For financial reporting purposes, foreign subsidiaries maintain records in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency. The dollar is the currency that reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to the entity. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in pesos are remeasured into dollars using current exchange rates. The difference between the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the exchange rate on the settlement date, or balance sheet date if not settled, is included in the income statement as foreign exchange gain or loss.

Cash Equivalents.

Short-term liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined by historical experience and adjusted for economic uncertainties or known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance when a customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has been transferred to a collection agent or submitted for legal action, or when a customer is significantly past due and all available means of collection have been exhausted. At

December 31, 2016

and


, the allowance for doubtful accounts was

$5.3 million

and

$4.9 million

, respectively. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, bad debt expense was

$1.2 million

,

$1.0 million

and

$0.4 million

, respectively.

Materials and Supplies.

Materials and supplies consisting of diesel fuel, items to be used in the maintenance of rolling stock and items to be used in the maintenance or construction of road property are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.

Derivative Instruments.

Derivatives are measured at fair value and recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded either through current earnings or as other comprehensive income, depending on hedge designation. Gains and losses on derivative instruments classified as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedge transactions is recognized in current period earnings.

Property and Equipment (including Concession Assets).

KCS capitalizes costs for self-constructed additions and improvements to property including direct labor and material, indirect overhead costs, and interest during long-term construction projects. For purchased assets, all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are capitalized.



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

Expenditures that significantly increase asset values, productive capacity, efficiency, safety or extend useful lives are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated primarily on the group method of depreciation, which the Company believes closely approximates a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets measured in years. The group method of depreciation applies a composite rate to classes of similar assets rather than to individual assets. Composite depreciation rates are based upon the Company’s estimates of the expected average useful lives of assets as well as expected net salvage value at the end of their useful lives. In developing these estimates, the Company utilizes periodic depreciation studies performed by an independent engineering firm. Depreciation rate studies are performed at least every three years for equipment and at least every six years for road property (rail, ties, ballast, etc.). The Company completed depreciation studies for KCSM in 2016 and KCSR in 2015. The impacts of the studies were immaterial to the consolidated financial results for all periods.

Under the group method of depreciation, the cost of railroad property and equipment (net of salvage or sales proceeds) retired or replaced in the normal course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Gains or losses on dispositions of land or non-group property and abnormal retirements of railroad property are recognized through income. A retirement of railroad property would be considered abnormal if the cause of the retirement is unusual in nature and its actual life is significantly shorter than what would be expected for that group based on the depreciation studies. An abnormal retirement could cause the Company to re-evaluate the estimated useful life of the impacted asset class.

Costs incurred by the Company to acquire the concession rights and related assets, as well as subsequent improvements to the concession assets, are capitalized and amortized using the group method of depreciation over the lesser of the current expected Concession term, including probable renewal of an additional 50-year term, or the estimated useful lives of the assets and rights.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value would be reduced to the estimated fair value. Future cash flow estimates for an impairment review would be based on the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which are the Company’s U.S. and Mexican operations. During the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, management did not identify any indicators of impairment.

Goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in business combinations. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the goodwill balance was

$13.2 million

, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed at least annually, or more frequently as indicators warrant, for impairment. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets’ fair values. The Company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill as of

November 30, 2016

and


, and concluded there was no impairment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Non-financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to recognition in the financial statements only in certain circumstances. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based upon the observability of inputs. Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance activities related to current operations are expensed as incurred.

Personal Injury Claims.

Personal injury claims in excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence. The Company’s personal injury liability is based on actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted basis by an independent third party actuarial firm and reviewed by management. The liability is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Adjustments to the liability are reflected as operating expenses in the period in which the adjustments are known. Legal fees related to personal injury claims are recorded in operating expense in the period incurred.

Health and Welfare and Postemployment Benefits.

The Company provides certain medical, life and other postemployment benefits to certain active employees and retirees. The Company uses actuaries to assist management in measuring the benefit obligation and cost based on the current plan provisions, employee demographics, and assumptions about financial and demographic factors affecting the probability, timing and amount of expected future benefit payments. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels, and the health care cost trend rate. Actuarial gains and losses determined at the measurement date (December 31) are recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of income.

Share-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts for all share-based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions. Under this method, compensation expense is measured at grant date fair value net of estimated forfeitures, and is recognized over the requisite service period in which the award is earned. The Company issues treasury stock to settle share-based awards.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of the deferred income tax items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws in the year of enactment. In addition, the Company has not provided U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed operating earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free transaction.

The Company has recognized a deferred tax asset, net of a valuation allowance, for net operating loss and tax credit carryovers. The Company projects sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset recorded less the valuation allowance. These projections take into consideration assumptions about future income, future capital expenditures and inflation rates. If assumptions or actual conditions change, the deferred tax asset, net of the valuation allowance, will be adjusted to properly reflect the expected tax benefit.

Treasury Stock.

The excess of repurchase price over par value of common shares held in treasury is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter 2018 and the Company plans to adopt the accounting standard using the modified retrospective transition approach.

The modified retrospective transition approach will recognize any changes from the beginning of the year of initial application through retained earnings with no restatement of comparative periods. The Company has substantially completed a review of the likely impacts of the application of the new standard to the



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

existing portfolio of customer contracts entered into prior to the adoption of the new standard and will continue to review new contracts entered into prior to the adoption of the new standard. Based on this review, the adop

tion of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases

, which requires lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease obligation for all leases. Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lessor accounting under the new standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter 2019 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,

which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Upon adoption of the new ASU, the Company plans to account for forfeitures as incurred. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows

, which reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The Company plans to early adopt the ASU beginning with the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

, that requires entities to recognize at the transaction date the income tax consequences of many intercompany asset transfers.  The Company plans to early adopt the ASU beginning with the first quarter of 2017.  The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

3. Mexican Fuel Excise Tax Credit

Fuel purchases made in Mexico are subject to an excise tax that is included in fuel expense. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined that it could utilize a credit available under changes in Mexican law for the excise tax included in the price of fuel that is purchased and consumed in locomotives and certain work equipment in Mexico. As a result, the Company recognized a

$62.8 million

benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Mexican fuel excise tax credit is realized through the offset of the current year Mexico income tax liability and income tax withholding payment obligations of KCSM with no carryforward to future periods.

4. Flooding in the Southeastern United States

In March 2016, flooding in the southeastern United States caused damage to the Company’s track infrastructure and interruptions to the Company’s rail service. The Company filed a claim under its insurance program for property damage, incremental expenses and lost profits caused by this flooding event. In December 2016, the Company settled its insurance claim related to the flooding, and as a result, recognized a gain on insurance recovery of

$3.0 million

. This gain primarily represents the recovery of lost profits and the replacement value of property in excess of its carrying value, net of the self-insured retention.  The gain on insurance recovery was recognized in Materials and other in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 5. Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share adjusts basic earnings per common share for the effects of potentially dilutive common shares, if the effect is not anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effects of shares issuable under the Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and shares issuable upon the conversion of preferred stock to common stock.

Note 9. Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy as described in Note 2 — “Significant Accounting Policies”. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts, which are classified as Level 2 valuations. The Company determines the fair value of its derivative financial instrument positions based upon pricing models using inputs observed from actively quoted markets and also takes into consideration the contract terms as well as other inputs, including market currency exchange rates and in the case of option contracts, volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the time to expiration. The fair value of the foreign currency derivative instruments was a liability of

$41.1 million

and

$46.0 million

as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

The Company’s short-term financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings. The carrying value of the short-term financial instruments approximates their fair value.

The fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated using quoted market prices when available. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates for debt with similar maturities and credit quality. The fair value of the Company’s debt was

$2,303.8 million

and

$2,287.5 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. The carrying value was

$2,296.9 million

and

$2,321.1 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively. If the Company’s debt were measured at fair value, the fair value measurements of the individual debt instruments would have been classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

. Derivative Instruments

The Company enters into derivative transactions in certain situations based on management’s assessment of current market conditions and perceived risks. Management intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions and in doing so, may enter into such transactions as deemed appropriate.

Credit Risk.

As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. The Company manages this risk by limiting its counterparties to large financial institutions which meet the Company’s credit rating standards and have an established banking relationship with the Company. As of

December 31, 2016

, the Company did not expect any losses as a result of default of its counterparties.

Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments.

The Company’s Mexican subsidiaries have net U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities which, for Mexican income tax purposes, are subject to periodic revaluation based on changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. This revaluation creates fluctuations in the Company’s Mexican income tax expense and the amount of income taxes paid in Mexico. The Company hedges its exposure to this cash tax risk by entering into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts known as zero-cost collars.

The foreign currency forward contracts involve the Company’s purchase of pesos at an agreed-upon weighted-average exchange rate to each U.S dollar. The zero-cost collars involve the Company’s purchase of a Mexican peso call option and a simultaneous sale of a Mexican peso put option, with equivalent U.S. dollar notional amounts for each option and no net cash premium paid by the Company.

Below is a summary of the Company’s 2016 and 2015 foreign currency derivative contracts

Commercial Paper.

The Company’s commercial paper program generally serves as the primary means of short-term funding. As of

December 31, 2016

, KCS had

$181.3 million

of commercial paper outstanding, net of

$0.1 million

discount, at a weighted-average interest rate of

. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31

(in millions):

Revolving Credit Facility

KCS with certain of its domestic subsidiaries named therein as guarantors, has an

$800.0 million

revolving credit facility (the “KCS Revolving Credit Facility”), with a

$25.0 million

standby letter of credit facility which, if utilized, constitutes usage under the revolving facility. The KCS Revolving Credit Facility serves as a backstop for KCS’s

$800.0 million

commercial paper program (the “KCS Commercial Paper Program”) which generally serves as the Company’s primary means of short-term funding.

Borrowings under the KCS Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin that KCS pays above the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) at any point is between

1.125%

and

2.0%

. As of December 31, 2016, the margin is

1.5%

based on KCS’s current credit rating.

The KCS Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by KCSR, together with certain domestic subsidiaries named therein as guarantors (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) and matures on

December 9, 2020

. The KCS Revolving Credit Facility agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants (including financial covenants related to a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio) and events of default that are customary for credit agreements of this type. The occurrence of an event of



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

default could result in the termination of the commitments and the acceleration of the repayment of any outstanding principal balance on the KCS Revolving Credit Facility and the KCS Commercial Paper Program.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, KCS had

no

outstanding borrowings under the KCS Revolving Credit Facility.

Debt Exchange

During the first quarter of 2016, KCS entered into agreements with certain holders of KCSR and KCSM senior notes (collectively, the “Existing Notes”) to exchange Existing Notes for new securities issued by KCS. Each KCS note issued in exchange for an Existing Note has the same interest rate, interest payment dates and maturity date and substantially identical redemption provisions as the corresponding Existing Note. The following table summarizes the outstanding notes that were exchanged on March 29, 2016 (

in millions

):

The Company has accounted for this transaction as a debt exchange as the exchanged debt instruments are not considered to be substantially different. The balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the KCS notes. There was no gain or loss recognized as a result of the exchange.

Senior

Notes

The Company’s senior notes include certain covenants which are customary for these types of debt instruments issued by borrowers with similar credit ratings.

The KCS Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KCSR and each current and future domestic subsidiary of KCS that guarantees the KCS Revolving Credit Facility or certain other debt of KCS or a Note Guarantor (collectively, the “Note Guarantors”).

KCSR’s senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured senior basis, by KCS and each current and future domestic subsidiary of KCS that guarantees the KCS Revolving Credit Facility or certain other debt of KCS or a note guarantor. KCSR’s senior notes and the note guarantees rank pari passu in right of payment with KCSR’s, KCS’s and the Note Guarantors’ existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations.

KCSM’s senior notes are denominated in U.S. dollars; are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations; rank pari passu in right of payment with KCSM’s existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and are senior in right of payment to KCSM’s future subordinated indebtedness.

Senior notes are redeemable at the issuer’s option, in whole or in part, at any time, by paying the greater of either

100%

of the principal amount to be redeemed and a formula price based on interest rates prevailing at the time of redemption and time remaining to maturity. In addition, KCSM senior notes are redeemable, in whole but not in part, at KCSM’s option at any time at a redemption price of

100%

of their principal amount, plus any accrued unpaid interest in the event of certain changes in the Mexican withholding tax rate.

3.125% Senior Notes.

On May 16, 2016, KCS issued

$250.0 million

principal amount of senior unsecured notes due

June 1, 2026

(the “3.125% Senior Notes”), which bear interest semiannually at a fixed annual rate of

3.125%

. The 3.125% Senior Notes were issued at a discount to par value, resulting in a

$1.3 million

discount and a yield to maturity of

3.185%

. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding commercial paper issued by KCS and for other general corporate purposes.



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

Floating Rate Senior Notes.

On October 28, 2016,

$250.0 million

principal amount of outstanding floating rate senior notes issued by KCS and KCSM (together, the “Floating Rate Senior Notes”) matured. The Floating Rate Senior Notes were redeemed by the Company upon maturity at a redemption price equal to

100%

of the principal amount using available cash on hand and commercial paper.

RRIF Loan Agreements

The following loans were made under the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (“RRIF”) Program administered by the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”):

KCSR RRIF Loan Agreement.

On February 21, 2012, KCSR entered into an agreement with the FRA to borrow

$54.6 million

to be used to reimburse KCSR for a portion of the purchase price of

thirty

new locomotives (the “Locomotives”) acquired by KCSR in the fourth quarter of 2011. The loan bears interest at

2.96%

annually and the principal balance amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of

February 24, 2037

. The obligations under the financing agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in the Locomotives and certain related rights. In addition, the Company has agreed to guarantee repayment of the amounts due under the financing agreement and certain related agreements. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any outstanding principal balance of the loan.

Tex-Mex RRIF Loan Agreement.

On June 28, 2005, Tex-Mex entered into an agreement with the FRA to borrow

$50.0 million

to be used for infrastructure improvements in order to accommodate growing freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA corridor. The loan bears interest at

4.29%

annually and the principal balance amortizes quarterly with a final maturity of

July 13, 2030

. The loan is guaranteed by Mexrail, which has issued a pledge agreement in favor of the lender equal to the gross revenues earned by Mexrail on per-car fees on traffic crossing the International Rail Bridge in Laredo, Texas. In addition, the Company has agreed to guarantee the scheduled principal payment installments due to the FRA from Tex-Mex under the loan agreement on a rolling five-year basis.

Locomotive Financing Agreements

During 2008 and 2011, KCSM entered into various financing agreements totaling

$216.0 million

to purchase locomotives. The agreements mature between

December 2020

and

September 2023

, are payable on a quarterly or semi-annual basis and contain annual interest rates ranging between

5.737%

and

9.310%

. KCSM has either granted the lender a security interest in the locomotives to secure the loan or has secured the loans by transferring legal ownership of the locomotives to irrevocable trusts established by KCSM to which the lender is the primary beneficiary and KCSM has a right of reversion upon satisfaction of the obligations of the loan agreements.

KCSM’s locomotive financing agreements contain representations, warranties and covenants typical of such equipment loan agreements. Events of default in the financing agreements include, but are not limited to, certain payment defaults, certain bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings and the failure to perform any covenants or agreements contained in the financing agreements. Any event of default could trigger acceleration of KCSM’s payment obligations under the terms of the financing agreements.

Debt Covenants Compliance

The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of

December 31, 2016

.

Other Debt Provisions

Certain loan agreements and debt instruments entered into or guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries provide for default in the event of a specified change in control of the Company or particular subsidiaries of the Company.

:

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

. Income Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized.

Tax Expense.

Tax Rates.

Differences between the Company’s effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of

35%

follow

(in millions):

_____________________

(i)

Mexican income taxes are paid in Mexican pesos, and as a result, the effective income tax rate reflects fluctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The foreign exchange impact on income taxes includes the gain or loss from the revaluation of the Company’s net U.S. dollar-denominated monetary liabilities into Mexican pesos which is included in Mexican taxable income under Mexican tax law. As a result, a strengthening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for the reporting period will generally increase the Mexican cash tax obligation and the effective income tax rate, and a weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar for the reporting period will generally decrease the Mexican cash tax obligation and the effective tax rate. To hedge its exposure to this cash tax risk, the Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, which are measured at fair value each period and any change in fair value is recognized in foreign exchange loss within the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note


Derivative Instruments for further information.

Difference Attributable to Foreign Investments.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company’s cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was

$2,181.8 million

. The Company has not provided a deferred income tax liability on the undistributed earnings because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the U.S. or remit the earnings in tax-free transactions. If the foreign earnings were to be remitted in a taxable transaction, as of

December 31, 2016

, the Company would incur gross federal income taxes of

$763.6 million

which would be partially offset by foreign tax credits.

Tax Carryovers.

The Company has U.S. state net operating losses which are carried forward from


to


years and are analyzed each year to determine the likelihood of realization. The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and separate tax filings from as early as 1999 and may expire as early as December 31, 2017 and as late as December 31, 2036. The state loss carryover at

December 31, 2016

, was

$435.1 million

. In addition, the Company has

$49.6 million

of U.S. federal tax credit carryovers consisting primarily of

$37.2 million

of track maintenance credits which, if not used, will begin to expire in 2025.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at

December 31, 2016

, were

$7.5 million

and, if not used, will begin to expire in 2025. A deferred tax asset was recorded in prior periods for the expected future tax benefit of these losses which will be carried forward to reduce only Mexican income tax payable in future years. A deferred tax asset is also recorded for an asset tax credit carryover in the amount of

$4.3 million

, which if not used, will begin to expire in 2017.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of

December 31, 2016

and


, was

$1.7 million

and

$1.1 million

, respectively. The Company believes it is more likely than not that reversals of existing temporary differences that will produce future taxable income and the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, related to loss carryovers and tax credits.

Uncertain Tax Positions.

The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The guidance requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements the benefit of a tax position only if the impact is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (

in millions

):

All of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective income tax rate if recognized and is not expected to significantly change in the next twelve months.

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included in income before taxes on the consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalty expense was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Tax Contingencies

. Tax returns filed in the U.S. for periods after 2012 and in Mexico for periods after 2008 for KCSM and after 2010 for Mexico subsidiaries other than KCSM remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The Servicio de Administración Tributaria (the “SAT”), the Mexican equivalent of the IRS, is currently examining the KCSM 2009, 2010 and 2011 Mexico tax returns and the 2013 Mexico tax return of KCSM Servicios. An SAT examination was completed during the second quarter of 2016 without adjustment for the 2012 Mexico tax return of KCSM Servicios. The Company litigated a Value Added Tax (“VAT”) audit assessment from the SAT for KCSM for the year ended December 31, 2005. In November 2016, KCSM was notified of a resolution by the Mexican tax court annulling this assessment.  The SAT has appealed this resolution.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will continue to prevail in this matter.  However, an unexpected adverse resolution could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in a particular quarter or fiscal year.



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

KCSM has not historically assessed VAT on international import transportation services provided to its customers based on a written ruling that KCSM obtained from the SAT in 2008 stating that such services were not subject to VAT (the “2008 Ruling”). Notwithstanding the 2008 Ruling, in December 2013, the SAT unofficially informed KCSM of an intended implementation of new criteria effective as of January 1, 2014, pursuant to which VAT would be assessed on all international import transportation services on the portion of the services provided within Mexico. Additionally, in November 2013, the SAT filed an action to nullify the 2008 Ruling, potentially exposing the application of the new criteria to open tax years. In February 2014, KCSM filed an action opposing the SAT’s nullification action. In December 2016, KCSM was notified of a resolution issued by the Mexican tax court confirming the 2008 Ruling.  The SAT has appealed this resolution.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that it will continue to prevail in this matter.  As of the date of this filing, the SAT has not implemented any new criteria regarding this assessment of VAT on international import transportation services.

Share Repurchase Program.

In May 2015, the Company announced a share repurchase program of up to

$500.0 million

, which expires on

June 30, 2017

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with certain employees whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

options become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are automatically funded and such employees are entitled to specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and entitlements of certain officers, directors, employees and others in the event of a specified change in control of the Company or subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts on

December 31, 2016

and


, were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at the time of any such change in control, the most significant of which would be the price paid for KCS common stock by a party seeking to control the Company, funding of the Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Cash Dividends on Common Stock.

The following table presents the amount of cash dividends declared per common share by the Company’s Board of Directors:

Note 15. Share-Based Compensation

On October 7, 2008, the Company’s stockholders approved the Kansas City Southern 2008 Stock Option and Performance Award Plan (the “2008 Plan”). The 2008 plan became effective on October 14, 2008 and replaced the Kansas City Southern 1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan. The 2008 Plan provides for the granting of up to

2.3 million

shares of the Company’s common stock to eligible persons as defined in the 2008 Plan. The material terms and performance measures of the 2008 Plan were reapproved by the Company’s stockholders on May 2, 2013.

On February 19, 2016 the Company granted

66,320

shares of nonvested stock (“the market-based award”) under the 2008 Plan. The market-based award contains a market condition that accelerates the vesting in

three

tranches if the

twenty

trading day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock is above

$84.14

,

$91.79

or

$99.44

. If the target share prices are met prior to December 31, 2017, the awards would vest on January 5, 2018. If the target prices are met after January 1, 2018 but prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant date, the awards would vest immediately. If the target prices are not met prior to the fifth anniversary of the grant date, the awards would forfeit. The target prices of

$84.14

and

$91.79

were met in the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. The target price of

$99.44

has not been met as of December 31, 2016. See further details in the nonvested stock summary table below.

Stock Options.

The exercise price for options granted under the 2008 Plan equals the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. Options generally have a


year vesting period and are exercisable over the


year contractual term, except that options outstanding become immediately exercisable upon certain defined circumstances constituting a change in control of the Company. The grant date fair value, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:

The expected dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price over a term equal to the estimated life of the options. The risk-free interest rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury rates for instruments with



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

terms approximating the expected life of the options granted, which represents the period of time the awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical experience of similar awards.

A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated.

December 31, 2016

, there were

562,754

shares available for future grants under the 2008 Plan.

Nonvested Stock.

The 2008 Plan provides for the granting of nonvested stock awards to officers and other designated employees. The grant date fair value is based on the closing market price on the date of the grant. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during the vesting period, which is generally


year or


year vesting for employees. Awards granted to the Company’s directors vest immediately on date of grant. The grant date fair value of nonvested shares, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

The fair value and requisite service period of nonvested market-based awards granted on February 19, 2016 are estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model are consistent with those used to value stock options and were as follows:

Performance Based Awards.

The Company granted performance based nonvested stock awards during 2016 (the “2016 Awards”), 2015 (the “2015 Awards”) and 2014 (the “2014 Awards”). The awards granted provide a target number of shares that generally vest at the end of a


year requisite service period following the grant date. In addition to the service condition, the number of nonvested shares to be received depends on the attainment of defined Company-wide performance goals based on operating ratio (“OR”) and return on invested capital (“ROIC”) over a

three

-year performance period. The 2016 Awards are also subject to a revenue growth multiplier based on a

three

-year performance period calculated as defined in the award agreement that can range from

80%

to

140%

of the award earned based on the OR and ROIC achieved. The number of nonvested shares ultimately earned will range between

zero

to

200%

of the target award.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) provides substantially all U.S. full-time employees of the Company, certain subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities, with the right to subscribe to an aggregate of

4.0 million

shares of common stock of the Company.

Prior to January 1, 2015, eligible employees could contribute, through payroll deductions, up to

5%

of their regular base compensation during

six

-month purchase periods. The purchase price for shares was equal to

90%

of the closing market price on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever was lower.

Effective January 1, 2015, the ESPP plan was amended to allow eligible employees to contribute up to

10%

of their regular base compensation during

six

-month purchase periods at a purchase price equal to

85%

of the closing market price on either the exercise date or the offering date, whichever is lower.

At the end of each purchase period, the accumulated deductions are applied toward the purchase of the Company’s common stock. Both the discount in grant price and the share option purchase price are valued to derive the award’s fair value. The awards vest and the expense is recognized ratably over the offering period.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which, except as set forth below, are of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations. Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by current and former employees for job-related injuries and by third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS aggressively defends these matters and has established liability provisions, which management believes are adequate to cover expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of management, other than those proceedings described in detail below, such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. The major U.S. environmental laws to which the Company is subject include, among others, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. CERCLA can impose joint and several liabilities for cleanup and investigation costs, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well as those who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous substances. The Company does not believe that compliance with the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will impair its competitive capability or result in any material additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs. The Company is, however, subject to environmental remediation costs as described in the following paragraphs.

The Company’s Mexico operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment through the establishment of standards for water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and criminal proceedings, impose economic sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and chemicals industry, the Company transports hazardous materials and has a professional team available to respond to and handle environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such materials.

The Company performs ongoing reviews and evaluations of the various environmental programs and issues within the Company’s operations, and, as necessary, takes actions intended to limit the Company’s exposure to potential liability. Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Personal Injury.

The Company’s personal injury liability is based on semi-annual actuarial studies performed on an undiscounted basis by an independent third party actuarial firm and reviewed by management. This liability is based on personal injury claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Adjustments to the liability are reflected within operating expenses in the period in which changes to estimates are known. Personal injury claims in excess of self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence. The personal injury liability as of

December 31, 2016

is based on an updated actuarial study of personal injury claims through November 30, 2016 and review of December 2016 experience. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company recorded a

$1.1 million

and

$6.1 million

reduction, respectively, in personal injury liability, due to changes in estimates as a result of the Company’s claims development and settlement experience.

The personal injury liability activity was as follows

Certain Disputes with Ferromex.

KCSM and Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”) use certain trackage rights, switching services and interline services provided by each other. KCSM and Ferromex had not agreed on the rates to be charged for trackage rights and switching services for periods beginning in 1998 through December 31, 2008, or for interline services for periods beginning in 1998 through February 8, 2010. Both KCSM and Ferromex had initiated administrative proceedings seeking a determination by the Mexican Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (“Secretary of Communications and



Kansas City Southern and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)

Transportation” or “SCT”) of the rates that KCSM and Ferromex should pay each other. The SCT issued rulings in 2002 and 2008 setting the rates for the services and both KCSM and Ferromex had challenged these rulings based on different grounds. Additionally, KCSM and Ferromex had not settled amounts payable to each other for trackage rights and switching services for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In the first quarter of 2016, KCSM and Ferromex executed a settlement agreement resolving amounts payable to each other for trackage rights and switching services for periods beginning in 1998 through December 31, 2009, and for interline services for periods beginning in 1998 through February 8, 2010. Under this settlement agreement, KCSM and Ferromex also agreed to terminate all related administrative proceedings. This settlement agreement did not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Tax Contingencies.

Information regarding tax contingencies is included in Note 13 Income Taxes - Tax Contingencies.

Contractual Agreements.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various contractual agreements related to commercial arrangements and the use of other railroads’ or governmental entities’ infrastructure needed for the operations of the business. The Company is involved or may become involved in certain disputes involving transportation rates, product loss or damage, charges, and interpretations related to these agreements. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that, when resolved, these disputes will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Credit Risk.

The Company continually monitors risks related to economic changes and certain customer receivables concentrations. Significant changes in customer concentration or payment experience, deterioration of customer creditworthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectability of the Company’s receivables and its operating results. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company has recorded provisions for uncollectability based on its best estimate as of

December 31, 2016

Panama Canal Railway Company (”PCRC”) Guarantees and Indemnities.

At

December 31, 2016

, the Company had issued and outstanding

$5.5 million

under a standby letter of credit to fulfill its obligation to fund

fifty percent

of the debt service reserve and liquidity reserve established by PCRC in connection with the issuance of the

7.0%

Senior Secured Notes due

November 1, 2026

(the “PCRC Notes”). Additionally, KCS has pledged its shares of PCRC as security for the PCRC Notes.

Mexican Antitrust Review.

Pursuant to the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law as recently amended and the new Mexican Antitrust Law, on September 12, 2016, the Mexican government’s antitrust commission (Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica or “COFECE”), announced that it would review competitive conditions in the Mexican railroad industry, with respect to the existence of effective competition in the provision of interconnection services, trackage rights and switching rights used to render public freight transport in Mexico. The COFECE review includes the entire freight rail transportation market in Mexico and is not targeted to any single rail carrier. Notwithstanding that it is too early to determine what, if any, impact this review may have on Mexican rail operations in the future, if the COFECE determines there is a lack of effective competition, it could request the new Mexican Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario (“Regulatory Agency of Rail Transportation” or “ARTF”), which oversees primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican operations, to establish new limited mandatory trackage rights and/or rate regulation under the Amendments to the Mexican Regulatory Railroad Service Law. COFECE has extended its own preliminary report deadline to January 30, 2017.

Surface Transportation Board.

On July 27, 2016, the Surface Transportation Board issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Ex Parte 711 (Sub-No.1) Reciprocal Switching proposing rules related to reciprocal switching. Initial comments on the proposed rule were due by October 26, 2016, and replies to the initial comments were due by January 13, 2017. Until the rule has been finalized, KCS cannot determine what effect, if any, the rule will have on its business.
