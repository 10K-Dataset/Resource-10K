Item 1.

Business

COMPANY
    OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
    “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a holding
    company with domestic and international rail operations in North
    America that are strategically focused on the growing
    north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and
    industrial markets in the central United States with major
    industrial cities in Mexico. KCS and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 6,470 employees on December 31, 2006. The
    Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), which
    was founded in 1887, is a U.S. Class I railroad. KCSR
    serves a ten-state region in the Midwest and Southeast regions
    of the United States and has the shortest north/south rail route
    between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the
    Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern
    de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“KCSM”), through
    its wholly owned subsidiary, Grupo KCSM, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Grupo KCSM”), formerly known as Grupo
    Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., or Grupo
    TFM. Through its

50-year

Concession from the Mexican government (“the
    Concession”), KCSM operates a primary commercial corridor
    of the Mexican railroad system and has as its core route a key
    portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway between
    Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s
    principal industrial cities and three of its major shipping
    ports. KCSM’s rail lines are the only ones that serve Nuevo
    Laredo, Mexico, the largest rail freight interchange point
    between the United States and Mexico. Under the Concession, KCSM
    has the right to control and operate the southern half of the
    rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River
    between the United States and Mexico.

The Company wholly owns, directly and indirectly, through its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”)
    which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex operates a

157-mile

rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of
    Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR
    with KCSM. Tex-Mex connects with KCSM at the United
    States/Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and connects to KCSR
    through trackage rights at Beaumont, Texas. Through its
    ownership of Mexrail, the Company owns the northern half of the
    rail bridge at Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal
    international gateway through which more than half of all rail
    and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico
    crosses the border.

The KCS rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex) comprises
    approximately 6,000 miles of main and branch lines
    extending from the Midwest and Southeast portions of the United
    States south into Mexico and connects with other Class I
    railroads, providing shippers with an effective alternative to
    other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the
    Southeast and Southwest United States through less congested
    interchange hubs.

KCS also owns a fifty percent equity investment in the stock of
    Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), which holds the
    concession to operate a

47-mile

coast-to-coast

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal. The railroad
    handles containers in freight service across the Isthmus of
    Panama. Panarail Tourism Company (“Panarail”), a
    wholly owned subsidiary of PCRC, operates commuter and tourist
    railway services over the lines of PCRC.

Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a ninety percent
    owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line
    between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which
    is the portion of the KCSR rail line between Dallas, Texas and
    Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway.” Norfolk
    Southern Corporation (“NS”) through its wholly-owned
    subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns
    the remaining ten percent of MSLLC. Ultimately KCS will own
    seventy percent and NS will own thirty percent of MSLLC upon the
    contribution of additional capital by NS to MSLLC;



•

PABTEX GP, LLC, a wholly-owned and consolidated owner of a bulk
    materials handling facility with deep-water access to the Gulf
    of Mexico at Port Arthur, Texas that stores and transfers
    petroleum coke and soda ash from trucks and rail cars to ships,
    primarily for export;

•

Trans-Serve, Inc. (doing business as Superior Tie and Timber), a
    wholly-owned and consolidated operator of a railroad wood tie
    treatment facility;

•

Transfin Insurance, Ltd., a wholly-owned and consolidated
    captive insurance company, providing property, general liability
    and certain other insurance coverage to KCS and its subsidiaries
    and affiliates;

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that leases locomotives and rail equipment; and

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

MARKETS SERVED

Chemical and Petroleum.

KCS transports chemical and petroleum products via tank and hopper cars to markets in the Southeast and Northeast United States and throughout Mexico through interchanges with other rail carriers.
Primary traffic includes plastics, petroleum, oils, petroleum coke, rubber and miscellaneous chemicals.

Forest Products and Metals.

KCS’ rail lines run through the heart of the Southeast United States timber-producing region. The Company believes that

2006 Revenues

Business Mix

forest products made from trees in this region are generally
    less expensive than those from other regions due to lower
    production costs. As a result, southern yellow pine products
    from the Southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of
    western producers that have experienced capacity reductions
    because of public policy considerations. KCSR serves paper mills
    directly and indirectly through short-line connections.

This product category includes metals, minerals and ores such as
    iron, steel, zinc and copper. The majority of metals, minerals
    and ores mined, and steel produced in Mexico are used for
    domestic consumption. The volume of Mexican steel exports
    fluctuates based on global market prices. Higher-end finished
    products such as steel coils used by Mexican manufacturers in
    automobiles, household appliances and other consumer goods are
    imported through Nuevo Laredo and through the seaports served by
    KCS’ rail lines. United States slab steel products are used
    primarily in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry.

Agricultural and Mineral.

Agricultural
    products consist of grain, food and related products. Shipper
    demand for agricultural products is affected by competition
    among sources of grain and grain products, as well as price
    fluctuations in international markets for key commodities. In
    the United States, KCS’ rail lines receive and originate
    shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills
    serving the poultry industry. KCS currently serves feed mills
    along its rail lines throughout Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas,
    Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Through its marketing
    agreements, KCS has access to sources of corn and other grain in
    Iowa and other Midwest states. United States export grain
    shipments and Mexico import grain shipments include primarily
    corn, wheat, and soybeans transported to Mexico via Laredo and
    to the Gulf of Mexico for overseas destinations. Over the long
    term, export grain shipments to Mexico are expected to increase
    as a result of Mexico’s reliance on grain imports. Food and
    related products consist mainly of soybean meal, grain meal,
    oils and canned goods, sugar and beer. Mineral shipments consist
    of a variety of products including ores, clay, stone and cement.



Intermodal and Automotive.

The intermodal
    freight business consists primarily of hauling freight
    containers or truck trailers from motor carriers and ocean
    liners, with rail carriers serving as long-distance haulers. The
    automotive business consists primarily of moving parts to
    assembly plants and finished vehicles to distribution centers
    for market consumption in North and South America.

Coal.

KCS hauls unit trains of coal for ten
    electric generating plants in the central United States from the
    Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Coal mined in the Midwest United
    States is transported in

non-unit

trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills and cement
    companies.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION

The Company’s United States operations are subject to
    federal, state and local laws and regulations generally
    applicable to all businesses. Rail operations are subject to the
    regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board
    (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation
    (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the
    DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state
    regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and
    complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the
    sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line
    extensions and construction, and consolidation or merger with,
    or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers. DOT and OSHA
    each has jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a
    number of safety and health aspects of rail operations,
    including the transportation of hazardous materials. State
    agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect
    to health and safety in areas not otherwise regulated by federal
    law.

KCS’ subsidiaries, as well as its competitors, are subject
    to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations.
    These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic
    substances, and the generation, handling, storage,
    transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials.
    These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks
    and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental
    risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently
    involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.

Primary regulatory jurisdiction for the Company’s Mexican
    operations is overseen by the Secretary of Communications and
    Transportation (“SCT”). The SCT establishes
    regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and it is
    responsible for resolving disputes between railways and between
    railways and customers. In addition, KCSM must register its
    maximum rates with the SCT and make regular reports to the SCT
    on investment and traffic volumes.

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the
    imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of
    operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or
    the termination of the Concession. KCS believes that all
    facilities that it operates are in substantial compliance with
    applicable environmental laws, regulations and agency
    agreements. There are currently no material legal or
    administrative proceedings pending against the Company with
    respect to any environmental matters and management does not
    believe that continued compliance with environmental laws will
    have any material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition or results of operations. KCS cannot predict the
    effect, if any, that the adoption of additional or more
    stringent environmental laws and regulations would have on the
    Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial
    condition.

COMPETITION

The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are
    much larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources. Since 1994, there has been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. As a result, the
    railroad industry is now dominated by a few very large carriers.



The larger western railroads (BNSF Railway Company and Union
    Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are significant
    competitors to KCS because of their substantial resources. The
    ongoing impact of these mergers is uncertain. KCS believes that
    its investments and strategic alliances continue to position the
    Company to attract additional rail traffic throughout its rail
    network.

In November 2005, Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Ferromex”) acquired control of and merged with
    Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”),
    creating Mexico’s largest railway. The merger between
    Ferromex and Ferrosur has been declared illegal by the Mexican
    Antitrust Commission. Both Ferromex and Ferrosur have challenged
    this ruling. These merged operations are much larger than KCSM,
    and they serve most of the major ports and cities in Mexico and
    own fifty percent of FTVM, which serves all of the industries
    located within Mexico City.

The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge
    lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain
    routes in operating areas. Truck carriers have eroded the
    railroad industry’s share of total transportation revenues.
    Intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price
    sensitive competition, particularly from motor carriers.
    However, rail carriers, including KCS, have placed an emphasis
    on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working with
    motor carriers and each other to provide

end-to-end

transportation of products.

While deregulation of freight rates has enhanced the ability of
    railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes
    of transportation, this increased competition has resulted in
    downward pressure on freight rates. Competition with other
    railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based
    on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service
    provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for
    certain commodities.

EMPLOYEES
    AND LABOR RELATIONS

Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject
    to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for
    modification, but their terms remain in effect until new
    agreements are reached. Typically, neither management nor labor
    employees are permitted to take economic action until extended
    procedures are exhausted. Previously, these negotiations have
    not resulted in any extended work interruptions. Under the
    negotiating process which began on November 1, 1999, all
    unions reached new labor agreements with KCSR in 2005. Various
    collective bargaining agreements cover 81% of KCSR’s
    employees.

KCSM’s labor agreement covering approximately 75% of its
    employees was renewed in 2005 and is effective for a two-year
    term ending in July 2007. The compensation terms of the labor
    agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and
    all other terms are renegotiated every two years. These
    negotiations have not resulted in any strikes, boycotts or other
    significant disruptions of KCSM’s operations.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Related to an Investment in KCS’ Common Stock

The
    price of KCS’ common stock may fluctuate significantly,
    which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock
    when they want to or at prices they find
    attractive.

The price of KCS’ common stock on the New York Stock
    Exchange (“NYSE”) constantly changes. The Company
    expects that the market price of its common stock will continue
    to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can fluctuate as a result of a
    variety of factors, many of which are beyond KCS’ control.
    These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

quarterly variations in operating results;

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of management,
    securities analysts, ratings agencies and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to future financial performance,
    including financial estimates by securities analysts, ratings
    agencies and investors;

•

developments generally affecting the railroad industry;

•

announcements by KCS or its competitors of significant
    contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint
    ventures or capital commitments;

•

the assertion or resolution of significant claims or proceedings
    against KCS;

•

KCS’ dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of
    dividends;

•

future sales of KCS’ equity or equity-linked securities;

•

the issuance of common stock in payment of dividends on
    preferred stock or upon conversion of preferred stock; and

•

general domestic and international economic conditions.

In addition, from time to time the stock market in general has
    experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to
    the operating performance of a particular company. These broad
    market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of
    KCS’ common stock.

KCS’
    ability to pay dividends on its common stock is currently
    restricted, and KCS does not anticipate paying cash dividends on
    its common stock in the foreseeable future.

KCS has agreed, and may agree in the future, to restrictions on
    its ability to pay dividends on its common stock. In addition,
    to maintain its credit ratings, the Company may be limited in
    its ability to pay dividends on its common stock so that it can
    maintain an appropriate level of debt. During the first quarter
    of 2000, the board of directors suspended common stock
    dividends. KCS does not anticipate making any cash dividend
    payments to its common stockholders for the foreseeable future.

Holders
    of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred
    Stock may have special voting rights if KCS fails to pay
    dividends on that preferred stock over a stated number of
    quarters.

Because of certain restrictions in the indentures governing
    notes issued by KCSR, KCS did not pay dividends on its
    Series C Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock
    commencing on May 15, 2006, for the first quarter of 2006
    until those dividend arrearages were made up in February 2007.
    If dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock or
    Series D Preferred Stock are in arrears for six consecutive
    quarters (or an equivalent number of days in the aggregate,
    whether or not consecutive) holders of the Series C
    Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable,
    will be entitled to elect two of the authorized number of
    directors at the next annual stockholders’ meeting at which
    directors are elected and at each subsequent stockholders’
    meeting until such time as all accumulated dividends are paid on
    the Series C Preferred Stock or



Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, or set aside for
    payment. In addition, KCS will not be eligible to register
    future offerings of securities on

Form S-3

or to avail itself of the other benefits available to companies
    that qualify as “well-known seasoned issuers” under
    SEC rules if KCS fails to pay dividends on its preferred stock.
    This could adversely affect KCS’ ability to access capital
    markets, and increase the cost of accessing capital markets,
    until the Company qualifies as a “well-known seasoned
    issuer.”

Sales
    of substantial amounts of KCS’ common stock in the public
    market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the
    common stock.

As of December 31, 2006, there were 10,607,068 shares
    of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under the 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan and
    the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 2,061,234 shares of
    common stock held by executive officers and directors outside
    those plans, and 20,389,113 shares of common stock reserved
    for issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of
    convertible preferred stock. Sales of common stock by employees
    upon exercise of their options, sales by executive officers and
    directors subject to compliance with Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act, and sales of common stock that may be issued
    upon conversion of the outstanding preferred stock, or the
    perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the
    market price of KCS’ common stock.

KCS
    has provisions in its charter, bylaws and Rights Agreement that
    could deter, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring KCS
    and that could deprive an investor of an opportunity to obtain a
    takeover premium for shares of KCS’ common
    stock.

KCS has provisions in its charter and bylaws that may delay or
    prevent unsolicited takeover bids from third parties. These
    provisions may deprive KCS’ stockholders of an opportunity
    to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices.
    For example, the restated certificate of incorporation provides
    for a classified board of directors. It further provides that
    the vote of 70% of the shares entitled to vote in the election
    of directors is required to amend the restated certificate of
    incorporation to increase the number of directors to more than
    eighteen, abolish cumulative voting for directors and abolish
    the classification of the board. The same vote requirement is
    imposed by the restated certificate of incorporation on certain
    transactions involving mergers, consolidations, sales or leases
    of assets with or to certain owners of more than 5% of KCS’
    outstanding stock entitled to vote in the election of directors.
    The bylaws provide that a stockholder must give the Company
    advance written notice of its intent to nominate a director or
    raise a matter at an annual meeting. In addition, the Company
    has adopted a Rights Agreement which under certain circumstances
    would significantly impair the ability of third parties to
    acquire control of KCS without prior approval of the board of
    directors.

Risks
    Related to KCS’ Business

KCS
    competes against other railroads and other transportation
    providers.

The Company’s domestic and international operations are
    subject to competition from other railroads, in particular the
    Union Pacific Railroad Company (“UP”) and BNSF Railway
    Company (“BNSF”) in the United States and
    Ferromex in Mexico. Many of KCS’ rail competitors are much
    larger and have significantly greater financial and other
    resources than KCS. In addition, the Company is subject to
    competition from truck carriers and from barge lines and other
    maritime shipping. Increased competition could result in
    downward pressure on freight rates. Competition with other
    railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based
    on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service
    provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for
    certain commodities. While KCS must build or acquire and
    maintain its infrastructure, truck carriers, maritime shippers
    and barges are able to use public

rights-of-way.

The trucking industry has in the past provided effective rate
    and service competition to the railroad industry. Trucking
    requires substantially smaller capital investment and
    maintenance expenditures than railroads and allows for more
    frequent and flexible scheduling. Continuing competitive
    pressures, any reduction in margins due to competitive
    pressures, future improvements that increase the quality of
    alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which
    the Company operates, or legislation or regulations that provide
    motor carriers with additional advantages,



such as increased size of vehicles and reduced weight
    restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on results of
    operations, financial condition and liquidity.

A material part of KCS’ growth strategy is based upon the
    conversion of truck traffic to rail. There can be no assurance
    the Company will have the ability to convert traffic from truck
    to rail transport or that the customers already converted will
    be retained. If the railroad industry in general, and the
    Mexican operations in particular, are unable to preserve their
    competitive advantages vis-à-vis the trucking industry,
    projected revenue growth from the Mexican operations could be
    adversely affected. Additionally, the revenue growth
    attributable to the Mexican operations could be affected by,
    among other factors, KCS’ inability to grow its existing
    customer base, negative macroeconomic developments impacting the
    United States or Mexican economies, and failure to capture
    additional cargo transport market share from the shipping
    industry and other railroads.

NAFTA called for Mexican trucks to have unrestricted access to
    highways in United States border states by 1995 and full access
    to all United States highways by January 2000. However, the
    United States did not follow that timetable because of concerns
    over Mexico’s trucking safety standards. In February 2001,
    a NAFTA tribunal ruled in an arbitration between the United
    States and Mexico that the United States must allow Mexican
    trucks to cross the border and operate on United States
    highways. On March 14, 2002, as part of its agreement under
    NAFTA, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued safety
    rules that allow Mexican truckers to apply for operating
    authority to transport goods beyond the

20-mile

commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border. These
    safety rules require Mexican motor carriers seeking to operate
    in the United States to, among other things, pass safety
    inspections, obtain valid insurance with a United States
    registered insurance company, conduct alcohol and drug testing
    for drivers and obtain a U.S. Department of Transportation
    identification number. Under the rules issued by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation, it was expected that the
    border would have been opened to Mexican motor carriers in 2002.
    However, in January 2003, in response to a lawsuit filed in May
    2002 by a coalition of environmental, consumer and labor groups,
    the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a
    ruling which held that the rules issued by the
    U.S. Department of Transportation violated federal
    environmental laws because the Department of Transportation
    failed to adequately review the impact on United States air
    quality of rules allowing Mexican carriers to transport beyond
    the

20-mile

commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border. The
    Court of Appeals ruling required the Department of
    Transportation to provide an Environmental Impact Statement on
    the Mexican truck plan and to certify compliance with the United
    States Clean Air Act. The Department of Transportation requested
    the United States Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals
    ruling and, on December 15, 2003, the Supreme Court granted
    the Department of Transportation’s request. On June 7,
    2004, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Court of
    Appeals ruling. Although the Department of Transportation is no
    longer required to provide an Environmental Impact Statement
    under the Supreme Court’s ruling, the United States and
    Mexico must still complete negotiations on safety inspections
    before the border is opened. KCS cannot predict when these
    negotiations will be completed. There can be no assurance that
    truck transport between Mexico and the United States will not
    increase substantially in the future if the United States
    and Mexico complete the negotiations and the border is opened.
    Any such increase in truck traffic could affect KCS’
    ability to continue converting traffic to rail from truck
    transport because it may result in an expansion in the
    availability, or an improvement in the quality, of the trucking
    services offered by Mexican carriers.

Through KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government, the
    Company has the right to control and operate the southern half
    of the rail-bridge at Laredo, Texas. Under the Concession, KCSM
    must grant to Ferromex the right to operate over a north-south
    portion of KCSM’s rail lines between Ramos Arizpe near
    Monterrey and the city of Queretaro that constitutes over 600
    kilometers (360 miles) of KCSM’s main track. Using
    these trackage rights, Ferromex may be able to compete with KCSM
    over KCSM’s rail lines for traffic between Mexico City and
    the United States. The Concession also requires KCSM to grant
    rights to use certain portions of its tracks to Ferrosur and the
    “belt railroad” operated in the greater Mexico City
    area by FTVM, thereby providing Ferrosur with more efficient
    access to certain Mexico City industries. As a result of having
    to grant trackage rights to other railroads, KCSM loses the
    capacity of using a portion of its tracks at all times.



Ferromex, the operator of the largest railway system in Mexico,
    is in close proximity to KCSM’s rail lines. In particular,
    KCSM has experienced and continues to experience competition
    from Ferromex with respect to the transport of a variety of
    products. The rail lines operated by Ferromex run from
    Guadalajara and Mexico City to four United States border
    crossings west of the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo crossing, providing an
    alternative to KCSM’s routes for the transport of freight
    from those cities to the United States border. In addition,
    Ferromex directly competes with KCSM in some areas of its
    service territory, including Tampico, Saltillo, Monterrey and
    Mexico City. Ferrosur competes directly with KCSM for traffic to
    and from southeastern Mexico. Ferrosur, like KCSM, also services
    Mexico City and Puebla.

In November 2005, Grupo México, the controlling shareholder
    of Ferromex, acquired all of the shares of Ferrosur. The common
    control of Ferromex and Ferrosur would give Grupo México
    control over a nationwide railway system in Mexico and ownership
    of 50% of the shares of FTVM. The merger between Ferromex and
    Ferrosur has been declared illegal by the Mexican Antitrust
    Commission. Both Ferromex and Ferrosur have challenged this
    ruling. There can be no assurance as to whether Grupo
    México will be successful in challenging this ruling. If
    Grupo México is successful in its appeal, KCSM’s
    competitive position may be harmed.

On August 3, 2006, the Mexican Antitrust Commission
    announced an investigation into possible antitrust practices in
    the provision of rail cargo services. The targets of that
    investigation have not been identified, and while KCSM may be
    required to provide information in connection with the
    investigation, the Company does not believe KCSM’s
    operations are the subject of the inquiry, although there can be
    no assurance KCSM is not or would not become a subject of the
    inquiry.

Rate reductions by competitors could make KCS’ freight
    services less competitive, and KCS cannot assure that it would
    always be able to match these rate reductions. In recent years,
    KCS has experienced aggressive price competition from Ferromex
    in freight rates for agricultural products, which has adversely
    affected results of operations. KCS’ ability to respond to
    competitive pressures by decreasing rates without adversely
    affecting gross margins and operating results will depend on,
    among other things, the ability to reduce operating costs.
    KCS’ failure to respond to competitive pressures, and
    particularly rate competition, in a timely manner could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    condition.

In recent years, there has also been significant consolidation
    among major North American rail carriers. The resulting merged
    railroads could attempt to use their size and pricing power to
    block other railroads’ access to efficient gateways and
    routing options that are currently and have been historically
    available. There can be no assurance that further consolidation
    in the railroad industry, whether in the United States or
    Mexico, will not have an adverse effect on operations.

KCS’
    business strategy, operations and growth rely significantly on
    agreements with other railroads and third parties.

Operation of KCS’ integrated rail network and its plans for
    growth and expansion rely significantly on agreements with other
    railroads and third parties, including joint ventures and other
    strategic alliances. KCS’ operations are dependent on
    interchange, trackage rights, haulage rights and marketing
    agreements with other railroads and third parties that enable
    KCS to exchange traffic and utilize trackage the Company does
    not own. KCS’ ability to provide comprehensive rail service
    to its customers depends in large part upon its ability to
    maintain these agreements with other railroads and third
    parties. The termination of, or the failure to renew, these
    agreements could adversely affect KCS’ business, financial
    condition and results of operations. KCS is also dependent in
    part upon the financial health and efficient performance of
    other railroads. For example, traffic moves over the UP’s
    lines via trackage rights, a significant portion of KCSR’s
    grain shipments originate with another rail carrier pursuant to
    marketing agreements with that carrier, and BNSF is KCS’
    largest partner in the interchange of rail traffic. There can be
    no assurance that KCS will not be materially adversely affected
    by operational or financial difficulties of other railroads.

Pursuant to the Concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
    use portions of its tracks to Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM.
    Applicable law stipulates that Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM are
    required to grant to KCSM rights to use portions of their
    tracks. KCSM’s Concession classifies trackage rights as
    short trackage



rights and long-distance trackage rights. Although all of these
    trackage rights have been granted under the Concession, no
    railroad has actually operated under the long-distance trackage
    rights because the means of setting rates for usage and often
    related terms of usage have not been agreed upon. Under the
    Mexican railroad services law and regulations, the rates KCSM
    may charge for the right to use its tracks must be agreed upon
    in writing between KCSM and the party to which those rights are
    granted. However, if KCSM cannot reach an agreement on rates
    with rail carriers entitled to trackage rights on KCSM’s
    rail lines, the SCT is entitled to set the rates in accordance
    with Mexican law and regulation, which rates may not adequately
    compensate KCSM. KCSM and Ferromex have not been able to agree
    upon the rates each of them is required to pay the other for
    interline services and haulage and trackage rights. KCSM and
    Ferromex are involved in civil, commercial and administrative
    proceedings in connection with amounts payable to each other for
    interline services, haulage and trackage rights. On
    March 13, 2002, the SCT issued a ruling setting the rates
    for trackage and haulage rights. On August 5, 2002, the SCT
    issued a ruling setting the rates for interline and terminal
    services. KCSM and Ferromex appealed both rulings to the Mexican
    Supreme Court. KCSM and Ferromex also requested and obtained a
    suspension of the effectiveness of the SCT rulings pending
    resolution of the litigation. In February 2006, the Mexican
    Supreme Court sustained KCSM’s appeal of the SCT’s
    trackage and haulage rights ruling, vacated the SCT ruling and
    ordered the SCT to issue a new ruling consistent with the
    Court’s opinion. The Company has not yet received the
    written opinion of the Mexican Supreme Court on the February
    2006 ruling, nor has the Court decided the interline and
    terminal services appeal. On October 2, 2006, KCSM was
    served with a claim by Ferromex asking for information
    concerning the interline traffic between KCSM and Ferromex from
    January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2004. KCSM has filed
    an answer to this claim. KCS cannot predict the ultimate outcome
    of these matters, or whether the rates KCSM is ultimately
    permitted to charge will be sufficient to adequately compensate
    it for the use of its tracks by Ferromex.

The
    Company is highly leveraged and has significant debt service
    obligations. KCS’ leverage could adversely affect its
    ability to fulfill obligations under various debt instruments
    and operate its business.

KCS’ level of debt could make it more difficult for it to
    borrow money in the future, may reduce the amount of money
    available to finance operations and other business activities,
    exposes the Company to the risk of increased interest rates,
    makes it more vulnerable to general economic downturns and
    adverse industry conditions, and could reduce flexibility in
    planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic
    conditions. KCS’ failure to comply with the financial and
    other restrictive covenants in its debt instruments, which,
    among other things, require KCS to maintain specified financial
    ratios and limit the ability to incur debt and sell assets,
    could result in an event of default that, if not cured or
    waived, could have a material adverse effect on business or
    prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service
    its debt, meet other obligations and fund other liquidity needs,
    KCS may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying
    capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or
    refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking
    additional equity capital. KCS cannot assure that any of these
    remedies, including obtaining appropriate waivers from its
    lenders, can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at
    all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt
    agreements may restrict the Company from adopting any of these
    alternatives.

The indebtedness of KCSM exposes it to risks of exchange rate
    fluctuations, because any devaluation of the peso would cause
    the cost of KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase, and
    could place the Company at a competitive disadvantage in Mexico
    compared to Mexican competitors that have less debt and greater
    operating and financing flexibility than KCSM does.

KCS’
    business is capital intensive.

The Company’s business is capital intensive and requires
    substantial ongoing expenditures for, among other things,
    additions and improvements to roadway, structures and
    technology, acquisitions, and maintenance and repair of
    equipment and rail system. KCS’ failure to make necessary
    capital expenditures to maintain its operations could impair its
    ability to serve existing customers or accommodate increases in
    traffic volumes.



KCS has funded, and expects to continue to fund, capital
    expenditures with funds from operating cash flows, leases and,
    to a lesser extent, vendor financing. KCS may not be able to
    generate sufficient cash flows from its operations or obtain
    sufficient funds from external sources to fund capital
    expenditure requirements. If financing is available, it may not
    be obtainable on acceptable terms and within the limitations
    contained in the indentures and other agreements relating to
    KCS’ debt.

KCSM’s Concession from the Mexican government requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects. If KCSM is
    unable to make such capital investments, KCSM’s business
    plan commitments with the Mexican government may be at risk,
    requiring KCSM to seek waivers of its business plan. There is no
    assurance that such waivers, if requested, would be granted by
    the SCT. KCSM may defer capital expenditures under its business
    plan with the permission of the SCT. However, the SCT might not
    grant this permission, and any failure by KCSM to comply with
    the capital investment commitments in its business plan could
    result in sanctions imposed by the SCT. The Company cannot
    assure that the Mexican government would grant any such
    permission or waiver. If such permission or waiver is not
    obtained in any instance and KCSM is sanctioned, its Concession
    might be at risk of revocation, which would adversely affect
    KCS’ financial condition and results of operations. See
    “KCSM’s Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or
    termination in certain circumstances” below.

KCS’
    business may be adversely affected by changes in general
    economic, weather or other conditions.

KCS’ operations may be adversely affected by changes in the
    economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that
    produce and consume the freight that KCS transports. The
    relative strength or weakness of the United States and Mexican
    economies affect the businesses served by KCS. PCRC and Panarail
    are directly affected by the Panamanian local economy and
    trans-Pacific trade flows. KCS’ investments in Mexico and
    Panama expose the Company to risks associated with operating in
    Mexico and Panama, including, among others, cultural
    differences, varying labor and operating practices, political
    risk and differences between the United States, Mexican and
    Panamanian economies. Historically, a stronger economy has
    resulted in improved results for KCS’ rail transportation
    operations. Conversely, when the economy has slowed, results
    have been less favorable. KCS’ revenues may be affected by
    prevailing economic conditions and, if an economic slowdown or
    recession occurs in key markets, the volume of rail shipments is
    likely to be reduced.

The Company’s operations may also be affected by natural
    disasters or adverse weather conditions. The Company operates in
    and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, and its
    facilities may be adversely affected by hurricanes and other
    extreme weather conditions. For example, hurricanes have
    adversely affected some of the Company’s shippers located
    along the Gulf Coast and caused interruptions in the flow of
    traffic within the southern United States and between the United
    States and Mexico. As another example, a weak harvest in the
    Midwest may substantially reduce the volume of business handled
    for agricultural products customers. Many of the goods and
    commodities transported experience cyclical demand. KCS’
    results of operations can be expected to reflect this cyclical
    demand because of the significant fixed costs inherent in
    railroad operations. Significant reductions in the volume of
    rail shipments due to economic, weather or other conditions
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The transportation industry is highly cyclical, generally
    tracking the cycles of the world economy. Although
    transportation markets are affected by general economic
    conditions, there are numerous specific factors within each
    particular market segment that may influence operating results.
    Some of KCS’ customers do business in industries that are
    highly cyclical, including the oil and gas, automotive, housing
    and agricultural industries. Any downturn in these industries
    could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Also,
    some of the products transported have had a historical pattern
    of price cyclicality which has typically been influenced by the
    general economic environment and by industry capacity and
    demand. For example, global steel and petrochemical prices have
    decreased in the past. KCS cannot assure that prices and demand
    for these products will not decline in the future, adversely
    affecting those industries and, in turn, the Company’s
    financial condition or results.



KCS’
    business is subject to regulation by international, federal,
    state and local regulatory agencies. KCS’ failure to comply
    with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on
    its operations.

KCS is subject to governmental regulation by international,
    federal, state and local regulatory agencies with respect to its
    railroad operations, as well as a variety of health, safety,
    labor, environmental, and other matters. Government regulation
    of the railroad industry is a significant determinant of the
    competitiveness and profitability of railroads. KCS’
    failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could
    have a material adverse effect on operations, including
    limitations on operating activities until compliance with
    applicable requirements is achieved. These government agencies
    may change the legislative or regulatory framework within which
    the Company operates without providing any recourse for any
    adverse effects on its business that occur as a result of such
    change. Additionally, some of the regulations require KCS to
    obtain and maintain various licenses, permits and other
    authorizations, and KCS cannot assure that it will continue to
    be able to do so.

The
    Company’s business is subject to environmental, health and
    safety laws and regulations that could require KCS to incur
    material costs or liabilities relating to environmental, health
    or safety compliance or remediation.

KCS’ operations are subject to extensive international,
    federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws
    and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the
    air, discharges to waters, the handling, storage, transportation
    and disposal of waste and other materials, the cleanup of
    hazardous material or petroleum releases, decommissioning of
    underground storage tanks and noise pollution. Violations of
    these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties,
    permit revocations, facility shutdowns and other civil and
    criminal sanctions. From time to time, certain of KCS’
    facilities have not been in compliance with environmental,
    health and safety laws and regulations and there can be no
    assurances that KCS will always be in compliance with such laws
    and regulations in the future. The Company incurs, and expects
    to continue to incur, environmental compliance costs, including,
    in particular, costs necessary to maintain compliance with
    requirements governing chemical and hazardous material shipping
    operations, refueling operations and repair facilities. New laws
    and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements,
    new spills, releases or violations or the discovery of
    previously unknown contamination could require KCS to incur
    costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that
    could have a material adverse effect on KCS’ business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the operation of a railroad, it is possible that derailments,
    explosions or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to
    the environment or to human life or health. As a result, KCS may
    incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any
    such harm, including costs relating to the performance of

clean-ups,

natural resources damages and compensatory or punitive damages
    relating to harm to property or individuals.

The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
    and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”)
    and similar state laws (known as “Superfund laws”)
    impose liability for the cost of remedial or removal actions,
    natural resources damages and related costs at certain sites
    identified as posing a threat to the environment or public
    health. CERCLA imposes joint, strict and several liability on
    the owners and operators of facilities in which hazardous waste
    and other hazardous substances are deposited or from which they
    are released or are likely to be released into the environment.
    Liability may be imposed, without regard to fault or the
    legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons,
    including the current and certain prior owners or operators of a
    site where hazardous substances have been released and persons
    that arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous
    substances. In addition, other potentially responsible parties,
    adjacent landowners or other third parties may initiate cost
    recovery actions or toxic tort litigation against sites subject
    to CERCLA or similar state laws. Given the nature of its
    business, KCS presently has environmental investigation and
    remediation obligations at certain sites, including a former
    foundry site in Alexandria, Louisiana, and will likely incur
    such obligations at additional sites in the future. Liabilities
    accrued for environmental costs represent the Company’s
    best estimate of the probable future obligation for the
    remediation and settlement of these sites. Although the recorded
    liability includes the best estimate of all probable costs,

clean-up

costs can not be predicted with any certainty due to various
    factors such as evolving environmental laws and regulations,



changes in technology, the extent of other parties’
    participation, developments in environmental surveys and
    studies, and the extent of corrective action that may ultimately
    be required.

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment. The primary environmental law in Mexico is the
    General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental
    Protection (the “Ecological Law”). The Mexican
    federal agency in charge of overseeing compliance with and
    enforcement of the federal environmental law is the Ministry of
    Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
    (“Semarnat”). The regulations issued under the
    Ecological Law and technical environmental requirements issued
    by Semarnat have promulgated standards for, among other things,
    water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution,
    hazardous substances and transportation and handling of
    hazardous and solid waste. As part of its enforcement powers,
    Semarnat is empowered to bring administrative and criminal
    proceedings and impose economic sanctions against companies that
    violate environmental laws, and temporarily or even permanently
    close non-complying facilities. KCSM is also subject to the laws
    of various jurisdictions and international conferences with
    respect to the discharge of materials into the environment and
    to environmental laws and regulations issued by the governments
    of each of the Mexican states in which KCSM’s facilities
    are located. The terms of KCSM’s Concession from the
    Mexican government also impose environmental compliance
    obligations on KCSM. The Company cannot predict the effect, if
    any, that the adoption of additional or more stringent
    environmental laws and regulations would have on KCSM’s
    results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

KCS’
    business is vulnerable to rising fuel costs and disruptions in
    fuel supplies. Any significant increase in the cost of fuel, or
    severe disruption of fuel supplies, would have a material
    adverse effect on KCS’ business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

KCS incurs substantial fuel costs in its railroad operations and
    these costs represent a significant portion of its
    transportation expenses. Significant price increases for fuel
    may have a material adverse effect on operating results. Fuel
    expense increased from 16% of consolidated operating costs
    during 2005 to 19% of consolidated operating costs during 2006.
    KCS has been able to pass the majority of these fuel cost
    increases on to customers in the form of fuel surcharges applied
    to customer billings. If KCS is unable to continue the existing
    fuel surcharge program for KCSR and expand the fuel surcharge
    program for KCSM, operating results could be materially
    adversely affected.

On January 26, 2007, the Surface Transportation Board (the
    “STB”) issued a decision finding that the assessment
    by railroads of fuel surcharges that are based on a percentage
    of the base rate charged is an unreasonable practice. Railroads
    have 90 days following January 26 to comply with the
    decision. KCS is in the process of reviewing the manner by which
    it assesses fuel surcharges in order to timely comply with the
    decision. KCS cannot predict with certainty the impact that any
    changes to its fuel surcharge program may have on its business.

Fuel costs are affected by traffic levels, efficiency of
    operations and equipment, and petroleum market conditions. The
    supply and cost of fuel are subject to market conditions and are
    influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company’s
    control, including general economic conditions, world markets,
    government programs and regulations and competition. In
    addition, instability in the Middle East and interruptions in
    domestic production and refining due to hurricane damage may
    result in an increase in fuel prices. Fuel prices and supplies
    could also be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or
    by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing
    regulations. In the event of a severe disruption of fuel
    supplies resulting from supply shortages, political unrest, a
    disruption of oil imports, weather events, war or otherwise, the
    resulting impact on fuel prices could materially adversely
    affect KCS’ operating results, financial condition and cash
    flows.

KCS currently meets, and expects to continue to meet, fuel
    requirements for its Mexican operations almost exclusively
    through purchases at market prices from Petroleos Mexicanos, the
    national oil company of Mexico (“PEMEX”), a
    government-owned entity exclusively responsible for the
    distribution and sale of diesel fuel in Mexico. KCSM is party to
    a fuel supply contract with PEMEX of indefinite duration. Either
    party may terminate the contract upon 30 days written
    notice to the other at any time. If the fuel contract is
    terminated



and KCSM is unable to acquire diesel fuel from alternate sources
    on acceptable terms, the Mexican operations could be materially
    adversely affected.

The
    loss of key personnel could negatively affect
    business.

KCS’ success substantially depends on its ability to
    attract and retain key members of the senior management team and
    the principals of its foreign subsidiaries. Recruiting,
    motivating and retaining qualified management personnel,
    particularly those with expertise in the railroad industry, are
    vital to operations and success. There is substantial
    competition for qualified management personnel and there can be
    no assurance that KCS will always be able to attract or retain
    qualified personnel. Employment agreements with senior
    management are terminable at any time by either party. If KCS
    loses one or more of these key executives or principals, its
    ability to successfully implement its business plans and the
    value of its common stock could be materially adversely affected.

A
    majority of KCS’ employees belong to labor unions. Strikes
    or work stoppages could adversely affect
    operations.

The Company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with
    various labor unions in the United States and Mexico. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately 81% of KCSR employees and
    approximately 75% of KCSM employees were covered by collective
    labor contracts. The Company may be subject to, among other
    things, strikes, work stoppages or work slowdowns as a result of
    disputes under these collective bargaining agreements and labor
    contracts or KCS’ potential inability to negotiate
    acceptable contracts with these unions. In the United States,
    because such agreements are generally negotiated on an
    industry-wide basis, determination of the terms and conditions
    of labor agreements have been and could continue to be beyond
    KCS’ control. KCS may, therefore, be subject to terms and
    conditions in industry-wide labor agreements that could have a
    material adverse affect on its results of operations, financial
    position and cash flows. If the unionized workers in the United
    States or Mexico were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or
    other slowdown, if other employees were to become unionized, or
    if the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were
    renegotiated, KCS could experience a significant disruption of
    its operations and higher ongoing labor costs. Although the
    U.S. Railway Labor Act imposes restrictions on the right of
    United States railway workers to strike, there is no law in
    Mexico imposing similar restrictions on the right of railway
    workers in that country to strike.

KCS
    faces possible catastrophic loss and liability, and its
    insurance may not be sufficient to cover its damages or damages
    to others.

The operation of any railroad carries with it an inherent risk
    of catastrophe, mechanical failure, collision and property loss.
    In the course of KCS’ operations, spills or other
    environmental mishaps, cargo loss or damage, business
    interruption due to political developments, as well as labor
    disputes, strikes and adverse weather conditions, could result
    in a loss of revenues or increased liabilities and costs.
    Collisions, environmental mishaps or other accidents can cause
    serious bodily injury, death and extensive property damage,
    particularly when such accidents occur in heavily populated
    areas. Additionally, KCS’ operations may be affected from
    time to time by natural disasters such as earthquakes,
    volcanoes, floods, hurricanes or other storms. The occurrence of
    a major natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ operations and financial condition. The Company
    maintains insurance that is consistent with industry practice
    against the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of
    its business and business interruption due to natural disaster.
    However, this insurance is subject to a number of limitations on
    coverage, depending on the nature of the risk insured against.
    This insurance may not be sufficient to cover KCS’ damages
    or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be
    available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance,
    if any catastrophic interruption of service occurs, KCS may not
    be able to restore service without a significant interruption to
    operations and an adverse effect on KCS’ financial
    condition.



KCS’
    business may be affected by future acts of terrorism or
    war.

Terrorist attacks, such as an attack on the Company’s
    chemical transportation activities, any government response
    thereto and war or risk of war may adversely affect KCS’
    results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
    These acts may also impact the Company’s ability to raise
    capital or its future business opportunities.
    KCS’ rail lines and facilities could be direct targets
    or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which could cause
    significant business interruption and result in increased costs
    and liabilities and decreased revenues. These acts could have a
    material adverse effect on KCS’ results of operations,
    financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, insurance
    premiums charged for some or all of the terrorism coverage
    currently maintained by KCS could increase dramatically or
    certain coverage may not be available in the future.

KCSM’s
    Mexican Concession is subject to revocation or termination in
    certain circumstances.

KCSM operates under a

50-year

Concession granted by the Mexican government. The Concession
    gives KCSM exclusive rights to provide freight transportation
    services over its rail lines for 30 years of the

50-year

Concession, subject to certain trackage rights. The SCT is
    principally responsible for regulating railroad services in
    Mexico. The SCT has broad powers to monitor KCSM’s
    compliance with the Concession and it can require KCSM to supply
    it with any technical, administrative and financial information
    it requests. KCSM must comply with the investment commitments
    established in its business plan, which forms an integral part
    of the Concession, and must update the plan every five years.
    The SCT treats KCSM’s business plans confidentially. The
    SCT monitors KCSM’s compliance with efficiency and safety
    standards established in the Concession. The SCT reviews, and
    may amend, these standards every five years.

The Mexican railroad services law and regulations provide the
    Mexican government certain rights in its relationship with KCSM
    under the Concession, including the right to take over the
    management of KCSM and its railroad in certain extraordinary
    cases, such as imminent danger to national security. In the
    past, the Mexican government has used such power with respect to
    other privatized industries, including the telecommunications
    industry, to ensure continued service during labor disputes. In
    addition, under the Concession and the Mexican railroad services
    law and regulations, the SCT, in consultation with the
    Mexican Antitrust Commission, reserves the right to set
    tariffs if it determines that effective competition does not
    exist. The Mexican Antitrust Commission, however, has not
    published guidelines regarding the factors that constitute a
    lack of competition. It is therefore unclear under what
    particular circumstances the Mexican Antitrust Commission would
    deem a lack of competition to exist. If the SCT intervenes and
    sets tariffs, the rates it sets may be too low to allow KCSM to
    operate profitably.

The Concession is renewable for up to 50 years, subject to
    certain conditions. The SCT may terminate the Concession if,
    among other things, there is an unjustified interruption in the
    operation of KCSM’s rail lines, KCSM charges tariffs higher
    than the tariffs it has registered with the SCT, KCSM restricts
    the ability of other Mexican rail operators to use its rail
    lines, KCSM fails to make payments for damages caused during the
    performance of services, KCSM fails to comply with any term or
    condition of the Mexican railroad services law and regulations,
    KCSM fails to make the capital investments required under its
    five-year business plan filed with the SCT, or KCSM fails to
    maintain an obligations compliance bond and insurance coverage
    as specified in the Mexican railroad services law and
    regulations. In addition, the Concession would revoke
    automatically if KCSM changes its nationality or assigns or
    creates any lien on the Concession without the SCT’s
    approval. The SCT may also terminate the Concession as a result
    of KCSM’s surrender of its rights under the Concession, or
    for reasons of public interest, by revocation or upon
    KCSM’s liquidation or bankruptcy. Revocation or termination
    of the Concession would prevent KCSM from operating its railroad
    and would materially adversely affect the Mexican operations and
    the ability to make payments on KCSM’s debt. If the
    Concession is revoked by the SCT, KCSM would receive no revenue,
    and its interest in its rail lines and all other fixtures
    covered by the Concession, as well as all improvements made by
    it, would revert to the Mexican government.

In April 2006, the SCT initiated sanction proceedings against
    KCSM, claiming that KCSM had failed to make the minimum capital
    investments projected for 2004 and 2005 under its five-year
    business plan filed with the SCT. Although the Company believes
    KCSM made capital expenditures exceeding the amounts



projected in its business plan for 2004 and 2005, the SCT has
    objected to the nature of the investments made by KCSM. KCSM has
    responded to the SCT by providing evidence in support of its
    investments and explaining why it believes sanctions are not
    appropriate. The SCT has not yet responded to KCSM’s
    arguments. KCSM will have the right to challenge a negative
    ruling by the SCT before the Administrative Federal Court, and,
    if necessary, the right to challenge any negative ruling by the
    Administrative Federal Court before a Federal Magistrate’s
    Tribunal. However, if these proceedings are determined adversely
    to KCSM and sanctions are imposed, KCSM could be subject to
    fines, and could be subject to possible future revocation of the
    Concession if the SCT imposes sanctions on three additional
    occasions over the remaining term of the Concession.

Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to operate its rail
    lines, but it does not own the land, roadway or associated
    structures. If the Mexican government legally terminates the
    Concession, it would own, control and manage such public domain
    assets used in the operation of KCSM’s rail lines. The
    Mexican government may also temporarily seize control of
    KCSM’s rail lines and its assets in the event of a natural
    disaster, war, significant public disturbances or imminent
    danger to the domestic peace or economy. In such a case, the SCT
    may restrict KCSM’s ability to exploit the Concession in
    such manner as the SCT deems necessary under the circumstances,
    but only for the duration of any of the foregoing events.

Mexican law requires that the Mexican government pay
    compensation if it effects a statutory appropriation for reasons
    of the public interest. With respect to a temporary seizure due
    to any cause other than international war, the Mexican railroad
    services law and regulations provide that the Mexican government
    will indemnify an affected Concessionaire for an amount equal to
    damages caused and losses suffered. However, these payments may
    not be sufficient to compensate KCSM for its losses and may not
    be timely made.

The
    Company’s ownership of KCSM and operations in Mexico
    subject it to economic and political risks.

The Mexican government has exercised, and continues to exercise,
    significant influence over the Mexican economy.
    Accordingly, Mexican governmental actions concerning the economy
    and state-owned enterprises could have a significant impact on
    Mexican private sector entities in general and on the
    Mexican operations in particular. The national elections
    held on July 2, 2000, ended 71 years of rule by the
    Institutional Revolutionary Party and resulted in the increased
    representation of opposition parties in the Mexican Congress and
    in mayoral and gubernatorial positions. National elections were
    again held on July 2, 2006, which were disputed by the
    losing presidential candidate and his supporters. Although there
    have not yet been any material adverse repercussions resulting
    from this political change, multiparty rule is still relatively
    new in Mexico and could result in economic or political
    conditions that could materially and adversely affect the
    Mexican operations. KCS cannot predict the impact that this new
    political landscape will have on the Mexican economy.
    Furthermore, KCSM’s financial condition, results of
    operations and prospects may be affected by currency
    fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, regulation, taxation,
    social instability and other political, social and economic
    developments in or affecting Mexico.

Mexican national politicians are currently focused on certain
    regional political and social tension, and reforms regarding
    fiscal and labor policies, gas, electricity, social security and
    oil have not been and may not be approved. The social and
    political situation in Mexico could adversely affect the Mexican
    economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business, financial condition and results of operation.

The Mexican economy in the past has suffered balance of payment
    deficits and shortages in foreign exchange reserves. There are
    currently no exchange controls in Mexico. However, Mexico has
    imposed foreign exchange controls in the past. Pursuant to the
    provisions of NAFTA, if Mexico experiences serious balance of
    payment difficulties or the threat of such difficulties in the
    future, Mexico would have the right to impose foreign exchange
    controls on investments made in Mexico, including those made by
    United States and Canadian investors. Any restrictive exchange
    control policy could adversely affect KCS’ ability to
    obtain dollars or to convert pesos into dollars for purposes of
    making interest and principal payments due on indebtedness, to
    the extent KCS may have to effect those conversions, and could
    adversely affect the Mexican economy or the Company’s
    investment in KCSM. This could have a material adverse effect on
    KCS’ business and financial condition.



Securities of companies in emerging market countries tend to be
    influenced by economic and market conditions in other emerging
    market countries. Some emerging market countries, including
    Argentina and Brazil, have experienced significant economic
    downturns and market volatility in the past. These events have
    had an adverse effect on the economic conditions and securities
    markets of other emerging market countries, including Mexico.

Downturns
    in the United States economy or in trade between the United
    States and Mexico and fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange
    rate would likely have adverse effects on KCS’ business and
    results of operations.

The level and timing of KCS’ Mexican business activity is
    heavily dependent upon the level of United States-Mexican
    trade and the effects of NAFTA on such trade. The Mexican
    operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets for
    the products KCSM transports, the relative position of Mexico
    and the United States in these markets at any given time, and
    tariffs or other barriers to trade. Downturns in the
    United States or Mexican economy or in trade between the
    United States and Mexico would likely have adverse effects on
    KCS’ business and results of operations. The Mexican
    operations depend on the United States and Mexican markets
    for the products KCSM transports, the relative position of
    Mexico and the United States in these markets at any given time,
    and tariffs or other barriers to trade. Any future downturn in
    the United States economy could have a material adverse effect
    on KCS’ results of operations and our ability to meet debt
    service obligations.

Also, fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate could lead
    to shifts in the types and volumes of Mexican imports and
    exports. Although a decrease in the level of exports of some of
    the commodities that KCSM transports to the United States may be
    offset by a subsequent increase in imports of other commodities
    KCSM hauls into Mexico and vice versa, any offsetting increase
    might not occur on a timely basis, if at all. Future
    developments in United States-Mexican trade beyond the
    Company’s control may result in a reduction of freight
    volumes or in an unfavorable shift in the mix of products and
    commodities KCSM carries.

Any devaluation of the peso would cause the peso cost of
    KCSM’s dollar-denominated debt to increase, adversely
    affecting its ability to make payments on its indebtedness.
    Severe devaluation or depreciation of the peso may result in
    disruption of the international foreign exchange markets and may
    limit the ability to transfer pesos or to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars for the purpose of making timely payments of
    interest and principal on the non-peso denominated indebtedness.
    Although the Mexican government currently does not restrict, and
    for many years has not restricted, the right or ability of
    Mexican or foreign persons or entities to convert pesos into
    U.S. dollars or to transfer foreign currencies out of
    Mexico, the Mexican government could, as in the past, institute
    restrictive exchange rate policies that could limit the ability
    to transfer or convert pesos into U.S. dollars or other
    currencies for the purpose of making timely payments of the
    U.S. dollar-denominated debt and contractual commitments.
    Devaluation or depreciation of the peso against the
    U.S. dollar may also adversely affect U.S. dollar
    prices for KCS’ securities. Currency fluctuations are
    likely to continue to have an effect on KCS’ financial
    condition in future periods.

KCSM
    has identified possible discrepancies in data provided by its
    prior information system.

KCSM installed a new operational information system in 2006.
    Based on testing of the data provided by this system, including
    a comparison of such data to data provided by KCSM’s prior
    information system, it is possible that the data provided by
    KCSM’s prior information system may have contained
    discrepancies. There is uncertainty as to what effect, if any,
    these discrepancies could have on KCSM’s financial
    condition or results of operations, however there can be no
    assurance that the effect will not be material.

Mexico
    may experience high levels of inflation in the future which
    could adversely affect KCS’ results of
    operations.

Mexico has a history of high levels of inflation, and may
    experience high inflation in the future. During most of the
    1980s and during the mid- and

late-1990s,

Mexico experienced periods of high levels of inflation. The
    annual rates of inflation for the last five years, as measured
    by changes in the National Consumer Price



Index, as provided by Banco de Mexico, were 4.0% in 2006, 3.3%
    in 2005, 5.2% in 2004, 4.0% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2002. A
    substantial increase in the Mexican inflation rate would have
    the effect of increasing some of KCSM’s costs, which could
    adversely affect its results of operations and financial
    condition. High levels of inflation may also affect the balance
    of trade between Mexico and the United States, and other
    countries, which could adversely affect KCSM’s results of
    operations.

All of KCSM’s track is standard gauge (56.5 inches)
    and is generally in good condition. Regarding the main track,
    100% has 100 to 136-lbs. rail, 78% is continuously welded rail
    and 58% has concrete ties. Continuously welded rail reduces
    track maintenance and, in general, permits trains to travel at
    higher speeds. The Mexico City — Nuevo Laredo core
    route has 88% concrete ties and the portion of this route
    between Mexico City and Querétaro (a distance of
    143 miles) has double track. KCSM has extended sidings on
    its tracks up to 10,000 feet, enabling longer trains to

Under its Concession from the Mexican government, KCSM has the
    right to operate the rail lines, but does not own the land,
    roadway or associated structures. The Concession requires KCSM
    to make investments and undertake capital projects, including
    capital projects described in a business plan filed every five
    years with the Mexican government. KCSM may defer capital
    expenditures with respect to its five-year business plan with
    the permission of the SCT. However, should the SCT not grant
    this permission, KCSM’s failure to comply with the
    commitments in its business plan could result in the Mexican
    government revoking the Concession.

CORPORATE
    OVERVIEW

Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding
    company with principal operations in rail transportation and its
    principal subsidiaries and affiliates including the following:

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary;

•

Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”), a wholly-owned consolidated
    subsidiary; which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican
    Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”);

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a ninety percent
    owned consolidated affiliate;

•

Kansas City Southern de México, S. de R.L. de C.V.
    (“KCSM”). On April 1, 2005, KCS completed its
    acquisition of control of KCSM and as of that date, KCSM became
    a consolidated subsidiary of KCS. On September 12, 2005,
    the Company and its subsidiaries, Grupo KCSM, S.A. de C.V.
    (“Grupo KCSM”) and KCSM, along with the Mexican
    holding company Grupo TMM, S.A. (“TMM”), entered into
    a settlement agreement with the Mexican government resolving the
    controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
    government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
    the purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM owned by the
    Mexican government. As a result of this settlement, KCS and its
    subsidiaries now wholly own Grupo KCSM and KCSM. For the first
    quarter of 2005, KCS accounted for its investment in KCSM on the
    equity basis of accounting.



•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that owns and leases locomotives and other rail equipment;

•

Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), a fifty percent
    owned unconsolidated affiliate which owns all of the common
    stock of Panarail Tourism Company (“Panarail”).

•

Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V.
    (“FTVM”), a twenty five percent owned unconsolidated
    affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary
    services in the greater Mexico City area.

KCS, as the holding company, supplies its various subsidiaries
    with managerial, legal, tax, financial and accounting services,
    in addition to managing other “non-operating”
    investments.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

    Financial Overview.

The Company achieved consolidated net income of
    $108.9 million in 2006, as compared to net income of
    $100.9 million in 2005. The 2005 net income includes a
    non-recurring gain of $131.9 million related to the VAT/Put
    settlement. Excluding this non recurring item, net income
    increased $139.9 million over the prior year.

Operating income increased $242 million in 2006 to
    $304.3 million as compared to $62.3 million in 2005.
    The increase in operating income was driven primarily by
    increased revenues during the year. The Company achieved record
    revenues of $1,659.7 million in 2006, which was a 23%
    increase over revenues of $1,352 million in 2005. Revenue
    in 2006 included a full year of consolidated results. The
    revenue increase was primarily driven by price increases, new
    and expanding business in both the U.S. and Mexico, and by the
    continued integration of KCSM operations in the consolidated
    results. Revenue growth in 2006 was 9% over 2005, including pro
    forma KCSM revenue for the full year in 2005.

Cash flows from operations increased to $267.5 million in
    2006 compared with $178.8 million in 2005, an increase of
    $88.7 million. Capital expenditures are a significant use
    of cash flows annually due to the capital intensive nature of
    railroad operations. Cash used for capital expenditures in 2006
    was $241.8 million as compared to $275.7 million in
    2005.

    Outlook.

Kansas City Southern expects to continue to integrate U.S. and
    Mexico operations and management with a focus on execution and
    realizing the full value of the network KCS has built.
    Consolidated revenue growth in 2007 is expected to be in line
    with 2005 — 2006 (including KCSM’s 2005 proforma
    results). Price increases and higher volume are expected to be
    key drivers of growth while KCS continues to position its
    network to increase length of haul and cross border traffic,
    where carload growth is expected to outpace economic growth and
    intermodal growth is expected to increase substantially.

With continued productivity increases in operations as well as
    the projected revenue growth, the full year operating ratio for
    2007 is expected to fall below 80%; although, the Company
    believes seasonality of business will have an impact on the
    current

quarter-over-quarter

improvement trends in the first half of the year.

The Company believes that liquidity will continue to improve as
    will the Company’s key credit statistics with anticipated
    improvements in operating income, continued focus on working
    capital reduction and other balance sheet opportunities.

The Company projects cash capital expenditures to maintain the
    railroad and meet anticipated future demand will be
    approximately $270 million in 2007. KCS also plans to
    acquire 150 new locomotives through operating lease arrangements
    at a cost of about $300 million. It is currently projected
    that U.S. operations will take delivery of 60 locomotives
    and 90 locomotives will be used in Mexico.

Panama Canal Railway, an equity investment of KCS, is also
    expected to continue strong growth in volumes and cash flow.



RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Preferred Stock Dividends.

On January 12,
    2007, the Company declared a cash dividend on the 4.25%
    Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred stock,
    series C (“Series C Preferred Stock”) and a
    stock dividend on the 5.125% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
    Preferred Stock, Series D (“Series D Preferred
    Stock”) for dividends in arrears that were due May 15,
    2006, August 15, 2006 and November 15, 2006, and the
    dividend payment due February 15, 2007. The dividend was
    paid February 15, 2007, to stockholders of record on
    February 5, 2007. The Company also declared a cash dividend
    on the 4%, noncumulative Preferred Stock, payable April 3,
    2007, to stockholders of record on March 12, 2007.

Consent Solicitation.

On January 29,
    2007, KCSR commenced a consent solicitation to amend the
    indentures under which KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2008
    (“9


/


% Notes”)
    and


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009
    (“7


/


% Notes”
    and together with the


/


%
    Notes, the “Notes”) were issued. The purpose of the
    consent solicitation was to (i) resolve an inconsistency in
    the inclusion of certain expenses, but not the income, of
    restricted subsidiaries in the calculation of the consolidated
    coverage ratio under the indentures, (ii) amend the
    definition of refinancing indebtedness to allow the inclusion of
    certain related premiums, interest, fees and expenses in
    permitted refinancing indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers
    of any defaults arising from certain actions taken in the
    absence of such proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007,
    KCSR obtained the requisite consents from the holders of each
    series of Notes to amend their respective indentures as
    described above and executed supplemental indentures containing
    such amendments and waivers.

Credit Facility Waiver.

On January 31,
    2007, KCS provided written notice to the lenders under the 2006
    Credit Agreement of certain representation and other defaults
    under the 2006 Credit Agreement arising from the potential
    defaults which existed under the KCSR indentures as described
    above. These defaults limited KCSR’s access to the
    revolving credit facility. In its notice of default, the Company
    also requested that the lenders waive these defaults. On
    February 5, 2007 the Company received a waiver of such
    defaults from all of the lenders under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. The Company is currently not in default of the 2006
    Credit Agreement and has access to the revolving credit facility.

Claims Asserted under the TMM Acquisition
    Agreement.

As part of the acquisition of Grupo
    KCSM in 2005, KCS issued escrow notes to TMM totaling
    $47.0 million which are subject to reduction for certain
    potential losses related to incorrect representations and
    warranties or breaches of covenants in the Acquisition Agreement
    by TMM. On January 29, 2007, KCS advised TMM that KCS
    intended to assert claims for indemnification under the
    Acquisition Agreement related to representations and warranties
    made by TMM. On February 1, 2007, KCS received a notice
    from TMM indicating that TMM would seek damages from KCS under
    the Acquisition Agreement, aggregating approximately
    $43 million as well as other unspecified damages. The
    parties are obligated under the Acquisition Agreement to attempt
    to resolve their differences informally and, if not successful,
    then to submit them to binding arbitration.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Year
    Ended December 31, 2006, Compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net Income.

Consolidated net income increased
    $139.9 million excluding the 2005 non-recurring

VAT/Put

settlement for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared
    to the same period in 2005. Including the $131.9 million VAT/Put
    settlement in 2005, consolidated net income increased
    $8 million. Operating income increased by
    $242.0 million primarily driven by targeted price increases
    and fuel surcharge, new and expanded existing business in both
    the U.S. and Mexico segments, and the integration of KCSM
    operations and a full year of consolidated operating results.
    Operating expenses increased by only 5% due to increased
    efficiencies from the integration of KCSM.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues increased
    $81.3 million compared to the prior year. The
    U.S. segment experienced revenue increases in all commodity
    groups except for the intermodal and automotive business, which
    decreased slightly due to a decline in automotive business
    driven by lower output and short term plant shutdowns in 2006.
    Overall increases in the majority of the commodities were driven
    by targeted price improvements, including increased fuel
    surcharges. The following discussion provides an analysis of
    revenues by commodity group.

Chemical and Petroleum.

Revenues increased for
    all of the chemical and petroleum products for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, due to targeted rate increases in the
    petroleum, agricultural chemicals and industrial gases sectors,
    and increased traffic volumes. Pricing improvement and stronger
    economic conditions during 2006 accounted for a majority of the
    growth in revenue in the year, while growth in the third and
    fourth quarters also reflected the Gulf Coast refineries’
    recovery from the past year’s hurricanes.



Forest Products and Metals.

Revenues increased
    in forest products and metal commodities for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, primarily due to targeted rate
    increases. Decreases in volume can be attributed to the lumber
    and chip products due to rising mortgage rates. This volume
    decline was only partially offset by increases in volume from
    higher production in the metals, rolled paper and military
    products.

Agricultural and Mineral.

Revenues increased
    in all agricultural and mineral products for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, due to targeted rate adjustments and an
    increase in velocity over certain corridors and business
    sectors. Overall improvement in velocity of unit grain and
    mineral trains accounted for a majority of the revenue growth
    during 2006. Declining market conditions during the third and
    fourth quarters of the year accounted for the decline in volume
    with the primary decrease in export grain.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Revenues decreased
    in the intermodal and automotive business for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, due to declines in the automotive
    business from suspended production at an automotive plant for a
    majority of the year. This decrease was offset partially by
    increased revenues in the intermodal business which were driven
    by higher volumes from existing customers as well as the
    generation of new intermodal business.

Coal.

Revenues increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, as a result of higher traffic volumes at
    certain electric generating stations in order to rebuild
    inventory stockpiles. The ability to rebuild stockpiles has been
    made possible by improved efficiencies at the coal mines and
    increased velocity achieved by KCSR and origin carriers.

Operating Expenses.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, U.S. operating expenses increased
    $0.8 million. The following summarizes the Company’s
    U.S. operating expenses

(in millions).

Compensation and benefits.

Compensation and
    benefits expense increased $19.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to 2005 as the result of
    increased incentive compensation, annual salary increases,
    increase in management headcount, and an increase in stock based
    compensation. Incentive compensation is tied to the financial
    results of the Company and accounted for $9.3 million of
    the increase. Stock based compensation increased by
    $2.9 million partially as a result of the implementation of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Additionally, the remaining increase
    is the result of annual salary increases and certain increases
    in headcount.

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense
    decreased $1.8 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease was
    primarily driven by decreases in legal costs, locomotive repair
    costs and rental income received on locomotives leased to Mexico
    operations on a short-term basis. The decreases were offset by
    increases in joint facilities expenses due to higher traffic and
    an increase in auto and truck repair expense.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased
    $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005 primarily as a result of a 7.9% increase in the
    average price per gallon and a 7.2% increase in consumption.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs increased
    $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005 as a result of entering into two new locomotive
    lease agreements for $14.8 million and new



freight car leases for $4.5 million during the year. This
    increase was offset by a decrease in car hire expense due to a
    reduction in the use of non-KCSR freight cars.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense increased $5.7 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005, primarily
    as a result of an increase in assets placed into service during
    the year. This increase was partially offset by an updated
    depreciation study which was completed during the year and
    resulted in a $3.0 million reduction in expense in the

th

quarter.

Casualties and insurance.

Casualties and
    insurance expense decreased $43.8 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 2005. During the third
    quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $37.8 million
    pre-tax charge for personal injury liabilities based upon an
    actuarial study in 2005. The remaining decrease in 2006 was
    primarily driven by a lower number of incidence as well as a
    decrease in the severity of derailments during the year compared
    to the prior year.

Other.

Other expense decreased
    $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 2005 primarily due to a $13.9 million
    reimbursement from the Mexico segment for shared service
    expenses paid by the U.S. segment during 2006. This was offset
    by an increase of $6.7 million in materials and supplies
    primarily as a result of price increases in freight car wheels.

Mexico
    Segment.

KCS acquired a controlling interest in Grupo KCSM effective
    April 1, 2005. The 2005 results reflect charges and costs
    associated with the acquisition and integration, as well as the
    effect of valuation adjustments as required by purchase
    accounting. Since April 1, 2005, the financial results of
    Grupo KCSM have been consolidated into KCS. Prior to that date,
    the investment for Grupo KCSM was accounted for under the equity
    method. Although not consolidated prior to April 1, 2005,
    revenue and expense information below includes Grupo KCSM
    results for the

st

quarter
    of 2005 for comparative purposes. Accounting policies for Grupo
    KCSM prior to the acquisition were materially consistent with
    U.S. operations, however, certain adjustments have been
    made to the results presented for comparability.

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled
    $774.0 million compared to $717.6 million for the
    comparable year ended December 31, 2005, which represented
    an increase of $56.4 million. Revenues increased despite a
    decrease in carloads mainly due to a reduction in the movement
    in finished vehicles for exportation. The increase in 2006 was
    mainly attributable to targeted rate increases and fuel
    surcharge. Carloads are a standard measure used by KCS to
    determine the volume of traffic transported over its rail lines.
    Imports into Mexico from the U.S., Canada and overseas
    represented approximately 56.3% and 56.2% of total revenues in
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 77.8% of total
    revenues in 2006 were attributable to international freight.



Chemical and Petroleum Products.

Revenues rose
    $19.4 million in 2006 primarily due to price increases,
    fuel surcharge revenue and volume increases over the prior year.
    The volume recovery increase was largely attributable to
    Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which had adversely impacted the
    Gulf coast refineries. Volume recovery was seen in fuel oil,
    diesel, gasoline and pet coke during 2006.

Forest Products and Metals.

Revenues increased
    $26.8 million in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to
    price strategies, longer hauls and increased fuel surcharge.
    Targeted rate increases were implemented in 2006 for movements
    of steel slabs and steel coil imports. Increased revenue was
    seen from longer hauls to Laredo as a result of a
    customer’s relocation of its distribution center from
    Zacatecas to Tuxtepec. Increases in the number of cross border
    paper imports were seen during the year as well.

Agriculture and Mineral.

Revenues from
    agricultural products increased $13.5 million compared to
    2005 primarily as a result of targeted rate increases and fuel
    surcharges. Volume increases in corn and sugar were partially
    offset by reductions in import shipments of soybeans, sorghum
    and wheat products. Revenues also grew due to an embargo on
    Ferromex lines. There was also increased activity during the
    last quarter of 2006 not expected to be imported through the

U.S.-Mexico

border. The fructose market increased and it is still growing
    without quotas on imports. The revenue increase has been
    favorable with movements of grain and products from
    U.S. origin to destinations on the KCSM lines. These
    increases were negatively affected by a reduction of volumes of
    sand and clay products, and lower traffic in route from Jaltipan
    to Queretaro, due to dwell times at Ferrovalle. Additionally
    revenues were also affected by the reduction in consumption of
    limestone in Lázaro Cárdenas during the second quarter
    2006.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Intermodal revenue
    increased $7.8 million during 2006 compared to 2005, as a
    result of increased numbers of steamship carriers that call at
    the port of Lázaro Cárdenas and consistent transit
    times on Intermodal trains. Automotive revenue decreased
    $18.4 million in 2006 compared to 2005, as a result of a
    reduction in the movement of finished vehicles for exportation
    to the U.S. and Canadian markets. Additionally, the movements of
    importation of finished vehicles, as well as the domestic
    distribution of these vehicles, have declined due to the
    logistics of their transportation.

Compensation and benefits.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, salaries, wages and employee benefits
    decreased $1.0 million compared to 2005. The decrease
    reflects a reduction in headcount and the depreciation effect of
    the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar during 2006. This
    decrease was partially offset by the annual salaries increase
    and the increase in wages and fringe benefits resulting from
    labor negotiations in July 2006.

Purchased services.

Purchased services
    decreased $14.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Certain
    trackage rights that were not used during 2006 resulting in
    lower costs, amortization of deferred credits established in
    connection with the push down of purchase accounting, and
    additional capitalization of certain overhead costs, reduced
    purchased services during the year. These decreases were
    slightly offset by increases in management and professional fees
    during 2006.



Fuel.

Fuel expenses increased
    $6.5 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the
    volatility of fuel prices during 2006. KCSM’s average price
    per gallon for fuel increased 4.6% in 2006 as compared to the
    prior year.

Equipment cost.

Equipment cost decreased
    $5.5 million compared to 2005. This decrease was attributed
    mainly to a reduction in the use of non-KCSM freight cars as a
    result of velocity and operations improvement. This decrease was
    partially offset by the amortization of certain deferred charges
    and credits established in connection with the push down of
    purchase accounting related to the fair value of operating
    leases for freight cars.

Casualties and insurance.

During 2006,
    casualties and insurance decreased $8.5 million compared to
    2005. This decrease was primarily the result of lower costs
    associated with derailments compared to activity that occurred
    during the second and third quarter of 2005.

Employees’ statutory profit sharing.

The
    $35.7 million decrease in employee statutory profit sharing
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to
    2005 was a result of four Supreme Court decisions in May of last
    year which denied the deductibility of NOL’s in a
    company’s profit sharing liability calculation. As a result
    of these court rulings the deferred profit sharing asset
    associated with these NOL’s was written down during 2005,
    which resulted in a non-cash charge to income of
    $35.6 million.

Other.

Other expenses decreased
    $19.9 million compared to December 31, 2005. This
    decrease primarily reflects lower bad debt expense as compared
    to 2005 of approximately $9.3 million, the recognition of
    transition cost of $2.0 million in 2005, a charge due to
    the revaluation of the inventory parts associated with the
    maintenance of the catenary line in the second quarter 2005 of
    $1.6 million and losses on sale of property prior to
    adoption of the group method of depreciation on April 1,
    2005, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in other
    leases.

Consolidated
    Non-Operating Expenses.

Consolidated Interest Expense.

Consolidated
    interest expense increased $33.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, driven primarily by the additional three
    months of KCSM interest expense. KCSM’s interest expense
    for the three months ended March 31, 2005, was
    $27.4 million. The remaining difference was due to higher
    average balances of and increased interest rates on floating
    rate debt in the current year.

Consolidated Debt Retirement
    Costs.

Consolidated debt retirement costs
    increased $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. During
    the year ended December 31, 2006, KCSR entered into an
    amended and restated credit agreement and wrote off
    $2.2 million and KCSM refinanced its 10.25% senior
    notes and wrote off $2.6 million in unamortized debt
    issuance costs. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
    $4.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs were
    written off in connection with the refinancing of KCSM’s
    11.75% debentures and its first amended and restated credit
    agreement.

Foreign Exchange.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the foreign exchange loss of
    $3.7 million compared to a gain of $3.5 million for
    the same period in 2005. During the year 2006 the
    U.S. dollar appreciated approximately 1.7% relative to the
    Mexican peso.

Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

Equity in earnings from
    unconsolidated affiliates was $7.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to $2.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. Significant components of
    this change follow:

•

Equity in losses from the operations of PCRC was
    $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2005. The
    decrease in losses of $.7 million is the result of a 13.1%
    increase in volume.

•

Equity in earnings of Southern Capital was $5.4 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, versus $2.8 million
    for the same period in 2005. The $2.6 million increase in
    earnings is the result of a reduction in depreciation expense as
    a majority of the locomotives owned by Southern Capital became
    fully depreciated during the year.



•

KCSM’s equity in earnings of FTVM was $2.9 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $2.9 million for the same period in 2005.

•

Equity in losses of KCSM was $1.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005.

Other Income.

Other income increased
    $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, due
    to the sale of land and other long term assets that were not
    associated with KCS’s railroad operations during 2006.

Consolidated Income Tax Provision
    (Benefit).

For the year ended December 31,
    2006, KCS’ income tax expense was $45.4 million, a
    change of $52.5 million as compared to a $7.1 million
    benefit for the year ended December 31, 2005. The effective
    tax rate increased from (9.3%) to 29.4% for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. This increase was
    primarily attributable to the absence of one-time items such as
    the non-taxable VAT/Put settlement which occurred in 2005 and
    the 2005 write-off of deferred profit sharing in Mexico.

Following the acquisition of control of Grupo KCSM in 2005, the
    Company has not provided U.S. federal income taxes on the
    undistributed earnings of Grupo KCSM since the Company intends
    to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United
    States.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2005, Compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2004

Net Income.

Consolidated net income for 2005
    increased $76.5 million compared to 2004 primarily as a
    result of a $131.9 million gain resulting from the VAT/Put
    Settlement, partially offset by a reduction in operating income
    of $21.2 million. Additionally, consolidated net income
    increased due to a reduction in provision for income taxes of
    $30.7 million.

The reduction in consolidated operating income was driven
    primarily by an additional $37.8 million charge in 2005 to
    recognize additional costs related to occupational and personal
    injury claims determined as a result of the annual actuarial
    study, which was completed during the third quarter of 2005, and
    the write off of KCSM’s deferred tax asset related to
    statutory profit sharing. On a consolidated basis, both revenues
    and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the
    acquisitions completed during the year. In addition to the
    acquisitions, revenue growth for 2005 continued to be driven by
    increased volume, targeted rate increases and increased fuel
    surcharges to help offset rising fuel prices. Consolidated
    operating costs generally increased consistent with the volume
    increases, although price increases also impacted compensation
    and benefits and fuel expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, U.S. revenues
    increased $164.9 million. The Mexrail acquisition accounted
    for $73.3 million of the increase in revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. U.S. revenue also experienced
    increases in all commodity groups due to a combination of higher
    carloadings, targeted price improvements and increased fuel
    surcharge revenue. Fuel surcharges increased to
    $52.0 million, which accounted for $35.3 million of
    the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2005, compared to the same period in 2004. The following
    discussion provides an analysis of the segment’s revenues
    by commodity group. Pending completion of the ongoing effort to
    change the Tex-Mex mark and finalize its merger into KCS
    operations, carload data are presented based on the combination
    of the carloads for KCSR and Mexrail, without elimination for
    cars interchanged between the two roads.

Chemical and Petroleum.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, U.S. chemical and petroleum
    products experienced increases in revenues in all commodity
    groups with the exception of inorganic chemicals. These
    increases were attributed to higher production, certain targeted
    rate increases and fuel surcharges. These revenue increases were
    partially offset by the effects of plant and production
    shutdowns resulting from the hurricanes during the second half
    of 2005. The impact of the Mexrail consolidation increased
    revenues $12.1 million in the chemical and petroleum
    product commodities for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Forest Products and Metals.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, forest products and metals revenue for
    the U.S. segment experienced growth in all commodities
    compared to the same period in 2004. For the year to date
    period, these increases resulted primarily from certain targeted
    rate increases and fuel surcharges partially offset by the
    impact of hurricanes in the 3rd quarter of 2005. For the
    year ended December 31, 2005, the consolidation of Mexrail
    contributed $19.0 million to forest products and metals
    revenue.

Agricultural and Mineral.

U.S. revenues
    in the agricultural and mineral products business unit increased
    for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increases were
    primarily the result of targeted rate increases and fuel
    surcharges. Additionally, for the year ended December 31,
    2005, all commodities, except grain, experienced increased
    traffic due to increased production. U.S. segment domestic
    grain carloads decreased, primarily due to a slowdown in
    equipment cycle times resulting in lower equipment availability
    for the year while the impact of local harvests moving to local
    feed mills reduced traffic in the third quarter of 2005 compared
    to the same period in 2004. Export grain carloads decreased
    primarily as a result of a decrease in gulf coast export traffic
    including the effects of hurricane weather in the gulf coast
    region. For the year ended



December 31, 2005, the consolidation of Mexrail contributed
    $30.7 million to agricultural and mineral products revenue.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Revenue for the
    U.S. segment intermodal and automotive commodity group for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, increased
    $9.8 million compared to the same period in 2004. Excluding
    the impact of the acquisition of Mexrail, intermodal traffic
    declined for the year ended December 31, 2005. The declines
    were the result of changes in shipper traffic patterns as well
    as the effects of hurricane weather during the third quarter of
    2005. Automotive traffic decreased as a result of decreased
    volumes from manufacturers for the year ended December 31,
    2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    consolidation of Mexrail contributed $5.5 million to
    intermodal and automotive products revenue.

Coal.

Increases in U.S. segment coal
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
    the same period in 2004 were due primarily to the addition of
    two new coal customers that were previously served by other
    railroads, certain targeted rate increases related to
    renegotiated contracts and overall increases in carloadings and
    traffic volumes at certain electric generating stations in
    response to demand. Mexrail has no significant coal revenues.

Operating Expenses.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, U.S. operating expenses increased
    $203.3 million (36.6%), when compared to the same period in
    2004. Of this increase, $83.3 million was attributable to
    the consolidation of Mexrail’s operations for the year
    ended December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes
    U.S. operating expenses of KCSR and Mexrail for the year
    ended December 31, 2005

(in millions).

For the year ended
    December 31, 2004, the operating expenses are KCSR only.

Compensation and benefits.

Increases in
    compensation and benefits expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004 were
    primarily the result of annual wage and salary rate increases
    which were effective July 1, 2004, as well as higher
    employee counts. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    consolidation of Mexrail added $19.4 million to
    compensation and benefits expense. The average headcount for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, was approximately 3,060
    compared to approximately 2,740 for the same period in 2004,
    including an increase of employees as a result of the
    consolidation of Mexrail.

Purchased services.

Purchased services expense
    for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased compared to
    the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of the
    consolidation of Mexrail’s operations. Mexrail has
    historically contracted for services in the maintenance of
    equipment and way and structures. Accordingly, Mexrail
    contributed $19.7 million to purchased services expense for
    the year ended December 31, 2005.

Fuel.

Fuel expense increased for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in
    2004. This increase was the result of a 50.5% increase in the
    average price per gallon, as well as a 26.0% increase in
    consumption. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    consolidation of Mexrail added $11.9 million to fuel
    expense.

Equipment costs.

Equipment costs for the year
    ended December 31, 2005, increased compared to the same
    period in 2004. Of this increase, $15.2 million was related
    to the Mexrail acquisition for the year ended



December 31, 2005. Excluding the impact of the Mexrail
    acquisition, equipment costs increased for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of increased
    equipment lease costs related to higher traffic levels and
    demand.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expense for the year ended December 31,
    2005, increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily
    as a result of a higher asset base, partially offset by property
    retirements. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the
    consolidation of Mexrail added $3.5 million to depreciation
    and amortization expense.

Casualties and insurance.

During the third
    quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $37.8 million
    pre-tax charge reflecting changes in its estimates for the cost
    of personal injury claims, which includes $7.5 million
    related to the Company’s first actuarial estimate of the
    cost of incurred but not reported occupational illness claims.
    The charge was recorded in “Casualties and Insurance”
    expense. The majority of the increases for FELA and third party
    claims are attributable to adverse experience versus the study,
    including an increase in the number of new claims and adverse
    developments in the dollar amount of claims and potential
    settlements for many significant prior claims. Increase related
    to occupational illness claims resulted primarily from a first
    time actuarial study. The Company is continuing its practice of
    accruing monthly for estimated claim costs at levels recommended
    by the actuarial study, and those accruals have been increased
    accordingly.

Mexico
    Segment.

KCS acquired a controlling interest in KCSM effective
    April 1, 2005. The nine month period ended
    December 31, 2005, results reflect charges and costs
    associated with the acquisition and integration, as well as the
    effect of valuation adjustments as required by purchase
    accounting. Management evaluates the results of its Mexico
    operations based on its operating performance during the current
    year and comparison to plan.

Revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2005,
    totaled $547.6 million compared to $510.5 million for
    the same period in 2004, an increase of $37.1 million. This
    increase was primarily attributable to the impact of fuel
    surcharges of $23.9 million which increased
    $21.5 million over the nine months ended December 31,
    2004, and increases in other factors of $15.6 million.

Chemical and Petroleum.

Revenues from chemical
    and petrochemical products during the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005, decreased from the same period in 2004
    primarily due to disruptions related to the



impact of hurricanes offset by increases in Mexican domestic
    revenues for the same period, primarily related to the higher
    consumption of fuel products.

Forest Products and Metals.

Domestic revenues
    increased during the nine months ended December 31, 2005,
    as a result of an increase in the production volumes of
    construction materials such as billets, bar and wire. Steel slab
    and steel coils revenue decreased as a result of lower
    international traffic, related to reduced consumption by
    manufacturing industries offset in part by certain targeted rate
    increases and fuel surcharges.

Agriculture and Mineral.

Revenues from
    agriculture products increased during the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005, compared to the same periods in 2004.
    The increases were primarily the result of targeted rate
    increases and fuel surcharges. Volume increases were seen in
    corn and sugar partially offset by reductions in import
    shipments of soybeans, sorghum and wheat products during the
    same 2005 period.

Intermodal and Automotive.

Intermodal freight
    revenue increased $1.6 million for the nine month period
    ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in
    2004. This increase was primarily attributable to the
    consolidation of steamship service at the port of Lázaro
    Cárdenas with the support of the port administration and
    Hutchinson Terminal. Automotive revenues for the nine month
    period ended December 31, 2005, decreased primarily as a
    consequence of lower domestic traffic offset by targeted
    increases in rates.

Operating Expenses.

Mexico operations reported
    operating expenses of $530.3 million in the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005. The following table summarizes

Compensation and benefits.

Salary expenses
    increased $8.4 million for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. The
    increase was largely attributable to the net effects of annual
    salary increases (4% in June 2005) and the increase in
    wages and fringe benefits as a result of our labor agreement
    revision in July 2005 (4.5% in wages and 2% in fringe benefits).

Purchased services.

Costs of purchased
    services decreased by $11.8 million for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in
    2004. Costs of purchased services consist primarily of expenses
    related to equipment maintenance, haulage, terminal services,
    security expenses and legal expenses. The decrease includes the
    effect of establishing a fair market value for locomotive
    maintenance agreements under purchase accounting of
    $4.9 million. As a result of the acquisition of Grupo KCSM,
    Management fee agreements were cancelled, resulting in a
    reduction of expenses. Additionally, lower legal costs related
    to the VAT refund claim and a lower cost of expatriates as a
    result of a personnel restructuring program contributed to the
    decrease.

Fuel.

Fuel expenses increased for the nine
    months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period
    in 2004 primarily due to the volatility of fuel prices during
    2005 and higher fuel consumption compared to 2004.

Equipment cost.

Equipment cost increased for
    the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
    same period in 2004. The variance is attributable principally to
    an increase in the number of hours and



number of movement miles in 2005 compared to 2004 for current
    traffic. Additionally the increase includes the effect of
    purchase accounting under which KCSM established a fair market
    value for all the operating leases for locomotives and freight
    cars. This, along with a higher number of freight cars leased
    for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to
    2004, resulted in higher rental expense.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation
    and amortization expenses in 2005 increased for the nine months
    ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same period in
    2004. This increase includes the effects of purchase accounting,
    whereby the book values of assets were adjusted upward based on
    a market value appraisal along with capital improvements to the
    lines resulting in additional depreciation and amortization.
    This increase was offset by the effect of changes in the
    estimated useful lives on properties, machinery and equipment
    resulting in a lower depreciation expense in 2005.

Casualties and insurance.

These expenses
    increased for the nine months ended December 31, 2005
    compared to the same period ended in 2004. These increases were
    primarily the result of costs associated with derailments that
    occurred over the nine months ending in 2005. This increase was
    partially offset by a reduction in the insurance premiums
    compared to 2004.

Employees’ statutory profit sharing.

The
    increase in the employees’ statutory profit sharing for the
    nine months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the same
    period in 2004 was a result of recent Mexican Supreme Court
    decisions in May 2005 denying the deductibility of NOL’s in
    calculating the Company’s employees’ profit sharing
    liability. As part of purchase accounting, KCS valued the profit
    sharing NOL asset at zero as a result of the court rulings and
    wrote off the deferred profit sharing asset associated with
    these NOL’s. This resulted in a charge to income of
    $35.6 million.

Other.

For the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005, these expenses increased compared to the
    same period ended December 31, 2004. The increase was
    primarily due to the reduction in value of certain assets after
    purchase accounting as well as management’s decision to
    increase the allowance for doubtful customer accounts based upon
    current prospects for collection of certain customer accounts.

Consolidated
    Non-Operating Expenses.

Consolidated Interest Expense.

Consolidated
    interest expense increased $89.1 million for year ended
    December 31, 2005, when compared to the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2004. This increase was the result of higher
    floating interest rates incurred under the credit agreement,
    increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility,
    interest associated with the debt assumed as part of the
    locomotive acquisition from El-Mo and the addition of interest
    expense of $71.4 million for the nine months ended
    December 31, 2005, due to the acquisition of KCSM and
    $1.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31,
    2005, due to the acquisition of Mexrail.

Consolidated Debt Retirement
    Costs.

Consolidated debt retirement costs
    increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005, when compared to the same period in 2004. For the year
    ended December 31, 2005, $4.4 million in unamortized
    debt issuance costs were written off primarily in connection
    with the refinancing of KCSM’s 11.75% debentures and
    its First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of
    June 24, 2004. During the year ended December 31,
    2004, KCS recorded $4.2 million of debt retirement costs
    resulting from the write-off of the unamortized balance of debt
    issuance costs associated with the previous credit facility.

Equity in Net Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates.

For the year ended December 31,
    2005, equity in earnings from other unconsolidated affiliates
    was $3.9 million compared to equity in losses from other
    unconsolidated affiliate of $2.1 million for the same
    period of 2004. Significant components of this change were as
    follows:

•

For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity in losses from
    the operations of PCRC was $1.7 million, compared to
    $2.1 million for the same period in 2004.

•

For the year ended December 31, 2005, equity in earnings of
    Southern Capital was $2.8 million, compared to
    $2.7 million, for the same period in 2004.



•

For the nine months ended December 31, 2005, KCSM’s
    equity in earnings of Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de
    México, S.A. de C.V. (“FTVM”) was
    $2.9 million.

For 2005, earnings for Southern Capital were $13.1 million
    compared to $11.8 million in 2004. This increase of
    $1.3 million was primarily the result of a gain recognized
    by Southern Capital for the sale of locomotives in 2005 of
    approximately $7.7 million as compared to $6.0 million
    in 2004. The sales of locomotives were to KCSR in the second
    quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. For purposes of
    recording its share of Southern Capital earnings, the Company
    has recorded its share of the gain as a reduction to the cost
    basis of the equipment acquired. As a result, the Company will
    recognize its equity in the gain over the remaining depreciable
    life of the locomotives as a reduction of depreciation expense.

Consolidated Income Tax Provision
    (Benefit).

For the year ended December 31,
    2005, KCS’s income tax benefit was $7.1 million, a
    change of $30.7 million as compared to a $23.6 million
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2004. This change
    was primarily due to the complexities relating to Mexico taxes
    resulting in an effective income tax rate of (9.3%) and 49.1%
    for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The primary causes of the decrease in the
    consolidated effective rate were the VAT/Put Settlement, the
    utilization of U.S. tax credits enacted for the tax year
    2005, a lower Mexican statutory tax rate of 30% as compared to
    U.S. statutory rate of 35%, and foreign exchange rate
    fluctuations and inflation. The VAT/Put Settlement gain was not
    taxable in Mexico and is not expected to be taxable for
    U.S. income tax purposes. The Company believes, based upon
    opinions of outside legal counsel and other factors, that the
    VAT/Put Settlement should not be taxable to KCS for
    U.S. income tax purposes. Such position has not been
    examined by taxing authorities and it is possible that this
    position could be challenged. The amount of such tax would be
    material; however the Company believes that it would have the
    right to indemnification under the terms of the Acquisition
    Agreement.

Following the acquisition of control of Grupo KCSM in 2005, the
    Company has not provided U.S. federal income taxes on the
    undistributed earnings of Grupo KCSM since the Company intends
    to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United
    States.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview

KCS’s primary uses of cash are to support operations;
    maintain and improve its railroad and information systems
    infrastructure; pay debt service and preferred stock dividends;
    acquire new and maintain existing locomotives, rolling stock and
    other equipment; and meet other obligations. See “Cash Flow
    Information and Contractual Obligations” below.

KCS has a Debt/Equity ratio of 52.6 percent. Its primary
    sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations,
    borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and access to
    debt and equity capital markets. Although KCS has had excellent
    access to capital markets, as a highly leveraged company, the
    financial terms under which funding is obtained often contain
    restrictive covenants. The covenants constrain financial
    flexibility by restricting or prohibiting certain actions,
    including the ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist
    liens, make prepayments of particular debt, pay dividends, make
    capital investments, engage in transactions with stockholders
    and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain assets, and
    engage in mergers and consolidations or in sale-leaseback
    transactions. On December 31, 2006, total available
    liquidity (the unrestricted cash balance plus revolving credit
    facility availability) was $144 million.

As a result of KCS acquiring a controlling interest in Grupo
    KCSM and KCSM, both companies became subject to the terms and
    conditions of the indentures governing KCSR’s two senior
    notes issues. The restrictive covenants of these indentures
    limit the ability of Grupo KCSM and KCSM to incur additional
    debt for any purpose other than the refinancing of existing debt
    and certain new asset financing.

During 2006 KCS’ ability to access capital markets was
    affected by the late filing of the Company’s annual report
    on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2005. This late filing also
    caused defaults under the Company’s credit agreements due
    to the Company’s failure to meet certain reporting
    requirements. Additionally, the Company’s ability to incur
    additional indebtedness and pay cash dividends was restricted by



the Company’s failure to comply with certain financial
    ratios under its indentures and credit agreements. A consequence
    of the late filing of the Company’s annual report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2005 and its failure to pay
    dividends on preferred stock was that its ability to quickly
    access the public equity markets has been reduced significantly,
    since KCS did not qualify as a “well-known seasoned
    issuer” and also cannot utilize the short-form registration
    statement on

Form S-3.

KCS paid accrued and unpaid and current dividends on its
    outstanding 4% Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock
    and Series D Preferred Stock on February 15, 2007, and
    believes it will become a well-known seasoned issuer and again
    be eligible to use short-form registration on

Form S-3

on May 1, 2007, as described below in “Shelf
    Registration Statements and Public Securities Offerings.”
    KCS sought and obtained amendments and waivers for each of these
    defaults in 2006.

The Company believes, based on current expectations, that cash
    and other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to capital
    markets, and other available financing resources will be
    sufficient to fund anticipated operating, capital and debt
    service requirements and other commitments through 2007.
    However, KCS’ operating cash flow and financing
    alternatives can be unexpectedly impacted by various factors,
    some of which are outside of its control. For example, if KCS
    was to experience a substantial reduction in revenues or a
    substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities,
    its operating cash flows could be significantly reduced.
    Additionally, the Company is subject to economic factors
    surrounding capital markets and its ability to obtain financing
    under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions. Further,
    KCS’ cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating
    agencies, which assign debt ratings based on certain credit
    measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.

As of December 31, 2006, Standard & Poor’s
    Rating Service (“S&P”) rated the senior secured
    debt as BB−, our senior unsecured debt as B− and the
    preferred stock as D. S&P also maintained a corporate rating
    on KCS of B and had a negative outlook. Moody’s Investor
    Service (“Moody’s”) rated the senior secured debt
    as Ba2, the senior unsecured debt as B3 and the preferred stock
    as Caa1. Moody’s also maintained a probability of default
    rating on KCS of B2 and had a stable outlook. On
    February 8, 2007, S&P changed the Company’s
    outlook from negative to stable and on February 16, 2007,
    they upgraded the rating on the preferred stock from D to CCC.

Long
    Term Debt and Credit Facility Activity.

On March 1, 2006, KCS, KCSR, and other KCS subsidiaries
    entered into a fourth waiver (the “Fourth Waiver”) of
    the credit agreement dated March 30, 2004 (the “2004
    Credit Agreement”). Under the terms of the Fourth Waiver,
    which was to expire on April 30, 2006, the Lenders agreed
    to waive the requirement that KCS maintain a leverage ratio (as
    defined in the 2004 Credit Agreement) of not more than 5.00:1
    for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, provided that such
    ratio did not exceed 5.50:1. The ratio did not exceed 5.50:1.

On March 31, 2006, KCSM failed to meet certain reporting
    requirements under the 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement and had not
    met the leverage ratio covenant at the end of 2005. These
    failures resulted in defaults under the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement and limited KCSM’s access to the revolving credit
    facility. On April 7, 2006, KCSM entered into an amendment
    and waiver (“Amendment and Waiver”) to the 2005 KCSM
    Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement was amended to
    (i) exclude certain payment obligations accrued under two
    locomotive maintenance agreements and under a track maintenance
    rehabilitation agreement from the definition of Indebtedness,
    (ii) eliminate certain minimum and multiple borrowing
    thresholds for peso borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting requirement to
    provide unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
    fourth fiscal quarter. The Amendment and Waiver also waived
    certain reporting requirements, including the requirement of
    KCSM to provide audited consolidated financial
    statements 90 days after the end of the 2005 fiscal
    year, provided such reports were delivered by April 30,
    2006, and compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
    obligations of Section 7.1(c) of the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement for the four quarters ending December 31, 2005,
    if compliance therewith was calculated without giving effect to
    the amendment to the definition of “Indebtedness” in
    the Amendment and Waiver,

provided

that KCSM was in
    compliance therewith after giving effect to the Amendment and
    Waiver.



KCSM is not currently in default under the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement and currently has access to the revolving credit
    facility.

On April 7, 2006, KCS, KCSR and other KCS subsidiaries
    entered into a fifth waiver of the 2004 Credit Agreement (the
    “Fifth Waiver”). Under the terms of the Fifth Waiver,
    which was to expire on April 30, 2006, the Lenders agreed
    to waive the requirement of Section 5.03(b) that KCS
    furnish a copy of its 2005 annual audited financial statements
    by March 31, 2006, so long as KCS furnished such audited
    financial statements by April 30, 2006. The Company
    furnished such audited financial statements by that date.

On April 28, 2006, KCS, KCSR and the other subsidiary
    guarantors named therein entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement (the “2006 Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of $371.1 million with The Bank of Nova
    Scotia and other lenders named in the 2006 Credit Agreement.
    Proceeds from the 2006 Credit Agreement were used to refinance
    the 2004 Credit Agreement. The 2006 Credit Agreement consists of
    (a) a $125.0 million revolving credit facility with a
    letter of credit sublimit of $25.0 million and swing line
    advances of up to $15.0 million, and (b) a
    $246.1 million term loan facility. The maturity date for
    the revolving credit facility is April 28, 2011 and the
    maturity date of the term loan facility is April 28, 2013.
    The 2006 Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or
    prohibit certain actions, including, but not limited to,
    KCS’ ability to incur debt, create or suffer to exist
    liens, make prepayment of particular debt, pay dividends, make
    investments, engage in transactions with stockholders and
    affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain assets, and engage
    in mergers and consolidations or in sale-leaseback transactions.
    In addition, KCS must meet certain consolidated interest
    coverage and leverage ratios. Failure to maintain compliance
    with the covenants could constitute a default which could
    accelerate the payment of any outstanding amounts under the 2006
    Credit Agreement.

On October 23, 2006, pursuant to an offer to purchase dated
    such date, KCSM commenced a cash tender offer and consent
    solicitation for any and all outstanding $150.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of its


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2007 (the “KCSM 2007 Senior Notes”). The
    consent solicitation expired on November 3, 2006. KCSM
    received consents in connection with the tender offer and
    consent solicitation from holders of over 97% of the KCSM 2007
    Senior Notes to amend the indenture under which the KCSM 2007
    Senior Notes were issued (the “2007 Indenture”), to
    eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
    included in the 2007 Indenture. The supplemental indenture
    relating to the KCSM 2007 Senior Notes containing the proposed
    changes (the “2007 Supplemental Indenture”) became
    effective on November 21, 2006. The tender offer expired at
    midnight, New York City time, on November 20, 2006 and KCSM
    purchased tendered notes on November 21, 2006, in
    accordance with the terms of the tender offer.

On November 21, 2006 KCSM issued $175.0 million of
    new, unsecured,


/


%
    senior notes due 2013 (the “KCSM 2013 Senior Notes”).
    Proceeds from the issuance were used to purchase the
    $146.0 million of tendered KCSM 2007 Senior Notes and repay
    $29.0 million of term loans under the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement.

On January 29, 2007, the Company commenced a consent
    solicitation to amend the indentures under which KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2008 (the
    “9


/


% Notes”)
    and


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009 (the
    “7


/


% Notes”
    and together with the


/


% Notes,
    the “Notes”) were issued. The Company identified
    certain inconsistencies in the language of the indentures which
    prevented KCS from obtaining a coverage ratio of at least
    2.00:1. The purpose of the consent solicitation was to
    (i) resolve an inconsistency in the inclusion of certain
    expenses, but not the income, of restricted subsidiaries in the
    calculation of the consolidated coverage ratio under the
    indentures, (ii) amend the definition of refinancing
    indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain related premiums,
    interest, fees and expenses in permitted refinancing
    indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any defaults
    arising from certain actions taken in the absence of such
    proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    obtained the requisite consents from the holders of each series
    of Notes to amend their respective indentures as described above
    and executed supplemental indentures containing such amendments
    and waivers.

On January 31, 2007, KCS provided written notice to the
    lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement of certain
    representation and other defaults under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement arising from the potential defaults which existed
    under the KCSR indentures governing the Notes as described
    above. These defaults limited



KCSR’s access to the revolving credit facility. In its
    notice of default, the Company also requested that the lenders
    waive these defaults. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    received a waiver of such defaults from all of the lenders under
    the 2006 Credit Agreement. The Company is currently not in
    default of the 2006 Credit Agreement and has access to the
    revolving credit facility.

During 2006, the consolidated cash position increased
    $47.9 million due to increased operating income which was
    partially offset by additional payments for the acquisition of
    Grupo KCSM and the refinancing and repayment of debt. During
    2005, the consolidated cash position decreased $7.5 million
    due to an increased level of capital expenditures. The primary
    sources of cash were cash inflows from operating activities, the
    issuance and assumption of long-term debt, the issuance of
    preferred stock and borrowings under the revolving credit
    facilities. The primary uses of cash were for capital
    expenditures, investments in affiliates, repayment of long-term
    debt and the repurchase of KCS’ common stock.

KCS’ cash flow from operations has historically been
    positive and sufficient to fund operations, roadway capital
    expenditures, other capital improvements and debt service.
    External sources of cash (principally bank debt, public debt,
    preferred stock and leases) have been used to refinance existing
    indebtedness and to fund acquisitions, new investments and
    equipment additions.

Net operating cash flows for 2006 increased $88.7 million
    to $267.5 million compared to $178.8 million in 2005.
    This increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable
    to better operating performance and the consolidation of KCSM
    for twelve months in 2006 as compared to nine months in 2005.
    The increase was partially offset by changes in working capital
    balances relating to the timing of payments and receipts.



Net operating cash flows for 2005 increased $36.1 million
    to $178.8 million largely due to the consolidation of KCSM
    which was partially offset by changes in working capital
    relating to the timing of payments and receipts.

Investing Cash Flows.

Net investing cash
    outflows were $166.0 million and $289.5 million during
    2006 and 2005, respectively. This $123.5 million decrease
    was related to decreased capital expenditures, increased
    property sales and the receipt of the MSLLC investment from NS.

Net investing cash outflows for 2005 decreased
    $87.3 million from 2004 due primarily to the investments in
    Mexrail and Grupo KCSM in 2004. During 2005, KCS capital
    expenditures increased $158.5 million, of which KCSM and
    Mexrail contributed $100.6 million.

Financing Cash Flows.

Financing cash inflows
    were derived from the issuance of long-term debt, including
    borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, the issuance
    of preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of common
    stock under employee stock plans. Financing cash outflows were
    used for the repayment of debt, the repurchase of KCS’
    common stock, the payment of dividends on KCS’ preferred
    stock and the payment of debt and preferred stock issuance
    costs. Financing cash flows for 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as
    follows:

•

Financing cash outflows for 2006 were $53.6 million,
    resulting primarily from the repayment of short and long term
    debt, including amounts related to the Grupo KCSM acquisition,
    and the costs associated with refinancing debt. During 2006, KCS
    entered into a new $371.1 million amended and restated
    credit agreement and used the proceeds to repay all amounts
    outstanding under the previous credit agreement. KCS also
    borrowed a net amount of $27.5 million under the Tex-Mex
    RRIF loan, repaid a net amount of $2.0 million under the
    KCSR revolving credit facility and repaid other amounts. KCSM
    issued $175.0 million of


/


%
    senior unsecured notes and used the proceeds to purchase
    $146.0 million of its


/


% senior
    unsecured notes and repay $29.0 million under its term loan
    facility. KCSM also used cash on hand to repay all amounts
    outstanding under its revolving credit facility.

•

Financing cash flows for 2005 were $103.2 million,
    resulting primarily from borrowings under the revolving credit
    facilities. During 2005 KCS issued $210.0 million of
    preferred stock and the net proceeds were used to repurchase
    9.0 million shares of KCS common stock. KCS also assumed
    debt under a purchase agreement for 75 locomotives, of which
    $24.3 million was outstanding at year end, borrowed
    $21.7 million under the Tex-Mex RRIF loan, and had
    borrowings of $92.0 million outstanding at year end under
    the KCSR revolving credit facility. KCSM issued
    $460.0 million of


/


% senior
    unsecured notes, and entered into a $106.0 million credit
    facility. The proceeds from these last two financings were used
    by KCSM to repay $443.5 million of senior discount
    debentures, $31.0 million under a bridge loan, the
    remaining balance of $67.5 million under the previous
    credit facility and the costs associated with the transactions.

•

Financing cash flows for 2004 were $137.3 million,
    resulting primarily from borrowings under a new
    $350.0 million credit agreement consisting of a
    $250.0 million term loan facility and a $100.0 million
    revolving credit facility. KCS used $100.0 million of the
    term loan to fund a portion of the escrow account under the
    acquisition of Grupo KCSM.

•

Proceeds from the sale of KCS common stock pursuant to employee
    stock plans were $8.6 million, $1.7 million and
    $7.4 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

•

Payment of cash dividends were $4.3 million,
    $8.7 million and $8.7 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Dividends of approximately $0.2 million were
    paid each year on the 4.0% noncumulative preferred stock;
    approximately $2.1 million, $8.5 million and
    $8.5 million of dividends were paid in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, on the Series C Preferred Stock; and
    approximately $2.0 million of dividends were paid in 2006
    on the Series D Preferred Stock. Cumulative dividends in
    arrears were paid February 15, 2007. Refer to Note 16
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.



Contractual Obligations.

The following table
    outlines the material obligations under long-term debt,
    operating lease and other contractual commitments on
    December 31, 2006

(in millions)

. Typically, payments
    for operating leases, other contractual obligations and interest
    on long-term debt are funded through operating cash flows.
    Principal payment obligations on long-term debt are typically
    refinanced by issuing new long-term debt. If operating cash
    flows are not sufficient, funds received from other sources,
    including borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from
    property and other asset dispositions might also be available.
    These obligations are customary transactions similar to those
    entered into by others in the transportation industry. KCS
    anticipates refinancing certain parts of the long-term debt
    prior to maturity.

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
    long-term contractual requirements for future goods and services
    needed for the operations of the business. Such commitments are
    not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably
    likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

The Company is party to three utilization leases covering 888
    railcars where car hire revenue as defined in the lease
    agreements is shared between the lessor and the Company. The
    leases expire at various times through 2011. Amounts that may be
    due to lessors under these utilization leases vary from month to
    month based on car hire rental with the minimum monthly cost to
    the Company being zero. Accordingly, the utilization leases have
    been excluded from contractual obligations above.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements.

As further described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

KCSR holds a fifty percent interest in Southern Capital.
    Southern Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition
    and leasing of equipment including locomotives, rolling stock
    and other railroad equipment. On June 25, 2002, Southern
    Capital partially refinanced the outstanding balance of certain
    debt through the issuance of 5.7% pass through trust
    certificates secured by all of the locomotives and rolling stock
    owned by Southern Capital and rental payments payable by KCSR
    under the operating leases of the equipment owned by Southern
    Capital. As Southern Capital is a fifty percent owned joint
    venture accounted for under the equity method, this debt is not
    reflected in KCS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets which are
    included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

PCRC, as described in Note 3, has the concession to
    reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway. Under the
    terms of a loan agreement with International Finance Corporation
    (“IFC”) the Company is a guarantor for up to
    $4.4 million of associated debt. Also, if PCRC terminates
    the concession contract without the IFC’s consent, KCS is a
    guarantor for up to half of the outstanding senior loans. The
    Company is also a guarantor for up to $0.5 million of PCRC
    equipment loans and capital leases, and has issued two
    irrevocable letters of credit totaling approximately
    $2.0 million to fulfill the Company’s fifty percent
    guarantee of a approximately $4.0 million equipment loan.



Capital
    Expenditures.

Capital improvements for roadway track structures have
    historically been funded with cash flows from operations. During
    2005, however, KCS used borrowings under its revolving credit
    facility to fund an expanded capital expenditure program. KCS
    has historically used internally generated cash flows or leasing
    for equipment capital expenditures. The Southern Capital joint
    venture provides the ability to lease-finance railroad
    equipment, and therefore, KCS has increasingly used
    lease-financing alternatives for its locomotives and rolling
    stock.

The following summarizes cash capital expenditures by type for
    the consolidated operations for the year ended December 31,
    2006, KCSR and Mexrail for the year ended 2005 and KCSM for the
    last nine months of 2005, and KCSR only for 2004

Maintenance
    and Repairs.

KCSR and KCSM, like other railroads, are required to maintain
    their own property infrastructure. Portions of roadway and
    equipment maintenance costs are capitalized and other portions
    are expensed (as components of material and supplies, purchased
    services and others), as appropriate. Maintenance and capital
    improvement programs are in conformity with GAAP as well as with
    the standards recognized within the rail industry and related
    regulatory agencies. KCS expects to continue funding roadway and
    equipment maintenance expenditures with internally generated
    cash flows.

    Total consolidated debt decreased $103.6 million, primarily
    as a result of payments of $75.4 million of debt related to
    the Grupo KCSM acquisition and KCSM’s payments of
    $55.4 million on the revolver and term loans. These debt
    payments were offset by the issuance of $27.5 million on
    the Tex-Mex RRIF loan.



Shelf
    Registration Statements and Public Securities
    Offerings.

KCS currently has three shelf registration statements on file
    with the SEC (“Initial Shelf” —

Registration No. 33-69648;

“Second Shelf” — Registration

No. 333-61006;

“Third Shelf” —

Registration No. 333-130112).

Securities in the aggregate amount of $300 million remain
    available under the Initial Shelf and securities in the
    aggregate amount of $450 million remain available under the
    Second Shelf. The Third Shelf was filed in accordance with the
    securities offering reform rules of the SEC that allow well
    known seasoned issuers to register an unspecified amount of
    different types of securities on an immediately effective

Form S-3

registration statement. On December 9, 2005, the Company
    completed the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its
    Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the Third Shelf. There
    remains an unspecified amount of securities available under the
    Third Shelf. To date, no securities have been issued under
    either the Initial Shelf or Second Shelf. As a consequence of
    the late filing of the 2005

Form 10-K,

KCS is ineligible to use any of these shelf registration
    statements until it has timely filed all periodic reports
    required under Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
    Exchange Act during the twelve calendar months and any portion
    of the month after the late

Form 10-K

filing was made. KCS was also ineligible to use the shelf
    registration statements during the period in which it failed to
    pay dividends on its 4% Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred
    Stock and Series D Preferred Stock. KCS paid the accrued
    and unpaid dividends and current dividends on the Series C
    Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock on
    February 15, 2007. KCS believes it will be eligible to use
    the shelf registration statements commencing May 1, 2007,
    provided KCS continues to pay dividends on its preferred stock,
    timely files all periodic reports required under the Exchange
    Act and otherwise meets the requirements for short-form
    registration under

Form S-3.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

KCS’ accounting and financial reporting policies are in
    conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Management believes that the following
    accounting policies and estimates are critical to an
    understanding of KCS’ historical and future performance.
    Management has discussed the development and selection of the
    following critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
    of KCS’ Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has
    reviewed the selection, application and disclosure of the
    Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates.

Depreciation
    of Property and Equipment.

The railroad industry is extremely capital intensive.
    Maintenance and the depreciation of operating assets constitute
    a substantial operating expense for KCS, as well as the railroad
    industry as a whole. The Company capitalizes costs relating to
    additions and replacements of property and equipment, including
    certain overhead costs representing the indirect costs
    associated with construction and improvement projects. Overhead
    factors are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect
    current costs using the full absorption method. All of these
    costs are depreciated using the group method consistent with
    industry standards and rules established by the STB. The cost of
    property and equipment normally retired, less salvage value, is
    charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the
    operating assets using group straight-line rates for financial
    statement purposes. The STB approves the depreciation rates used
    by KCSR (excluding the amortization of computer software) but
    not for KCSM. Both KCSR and KCSM periodically conduct studies of
    depreciation rates for properties and equipment and implements
    approved changes, as necessary, to depreciation rates. These
    studies take into consideration the historical retirement
    experience of similar assets, the current condition of the
    assets, current operations and potential changes in technology,
    estimated salvage value of the assets, and industry regulations.
    For all other consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is derived
    based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value
    using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
    of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation is
    based upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as
    their net salvage value at the end of their useful lives.
    Estimation of the useful lives of assets that are long-lived as



well as their salvage value requires significant management
    judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting
    estimates related to depreciation expense are critical.

Currently, KCSR and KCSM depreciate operating assets, including
    road and structures, rolling stock and equipment, and
    capitalized leases generally over a range of 3 to 50 years
    depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset. In
    addition to the adjustment to rates as a result of the
    depreciation studies, certain other events could occur that
    would materially affect the Company’s estimates and
    assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in
    operations or technology could substantially alter
    management’s assumptions regarding KCS’ ability to
    realize the return of its investment in operating assets and,
    therefore, affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge
    against both current and future revenues. Because depreciation
    expense is a function of analytical studies made of property,
    plant and equipment, subsequent studies could result in
    different estimates of useful lives and net salvage values. If
    future depreciation studies yield results indicating that the
    assets have shorter lives as a result of obsolescence, physical
    condition, changes in technology or changes in net salvage
    values, the estimate of depreciation expense could increase.
    Likewise, if future studies indicate that assets have longer
    lives, the estimate of depreciation expense could decrease.

KCSR Depreciation Review.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, KCSR engaged a civil engineering
    firm with expertise in railway property usage to conduct a study
    to evaluate depreciation rates for properties and equipment. The
    study centered on evaluating actual historical replacement
    patterns to assess future lives and indicated that KCSR was
    depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets
    were actually used, as estimated by the study. The effect of
    this change in estimate was a $3.0 million decrease in
    depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the group depreciation
    method for consistency with KCSR during 2005. Accordingly,
    changes were made to certain historical depreciation rates.
    Unlike KCSR, KCSM depreciation rates are not subject to the
    approval of the STB, accordingly, the changes to the
    depreciation rates were applied in 2005. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM engaged a civil engineering firm
    with expertise in railway property usage to conduct an analysis
    of depreciation rates for properties and equipment. The analysis
    centered on evaluating actual historical replacement patterns to
    assess future lives and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its
    property over shorter periods than the assets were actually
    utilized. As a result, depreciation expense recorded in the
    fourth quarter of 2005 reflected an adjustment totaling
    $5.5 million, to reduce depreciation expense as recorded in
    the second and third quarters of 2005. Concession rights and
    related assets are amortized over the shorter of their remaining
    useful lives as determined by the KCSM depreciation review or
    the life of the Concession.

Provision
    for Environmental Remediation.

As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

the Company’s operations are subject to extensive federal,
    state and local environmental laws and regulations in the U.S.
    and Mexico. KCS conducts studies, as well as site surveys, to
    determine the extent of environmental damage and the necessary
    requirements to remediate this damage. These studies incorporate
    the analysis of internal environmental engineering staff and
    consultation with legal counsel. From these studies and surveys,
    a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived. These
    cost estimates are based on forecasts of the total future direct
    costs related to environmental remediation and change
    periodically as additional or better information becomes
    available as to the extent of site remediation required, if any.
    KCS accrues for the cost of remediation where the obligation is
    probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated.

Cost estimates can be influenced by advanced technologies
    related to the detection, appropriate remedial course of action
    and anticipated cost. Certain changes could occur that would
    materially affect management’s estimates and assumptions
    related to costs for environmental remediation. If KCS becomes
    subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at
    known sites, discovers additional contamination, discovers
    previously unknown sites, or becomes subject to related personal
    or property damage, KCS could incur additional costs that could
    be significant in connection with its environmental remediation.
    Accordingly,



management believes that estimates related to the accrual of
    environmental remediation liabilities are critical to KCS’
    results of operations.

Environmental remediation expense was $3.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, and was included in purchased
    services expense on the consolidated statements of income.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, KCS had a liability
    for environmental remediation of $7.8 million. This amount
    was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    SFAS 5.

Provision
    for Casualty Claims.

Due to the nature of railroad operations, claims related to
    personal injuries and third party liabilities resulting from
    crossing collisions and derailments, as well as claims related
    to personal property damage and other casualties, is a
    substantial expense to KCS. Claims are estimated and recorded
    for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not
    reported (“IBNR”) occurrences. Consistent with the
    general practice within the railroad industry, the estimated
    liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined
    on an undiscounted basis. In estimating the liability for
    casualty claims, KCS obtains an estimate from an independent
    third party actuarial firm, which calculates an estimate using
    historical experience and estimates of claim costs as well as
    numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the
    derivation of an estimate of future claim costs.

Personal injury and casualty claims are subject to a significant
    degree of uncertainty, especially estimates related to incurred
    but not reported personal injuries for which a party has yet to
    assert a claim. In deriving an estimate of the provision for
    casualty claims, management must make assumptions related to
    substantially uncertain matters (injury severity, claimant age
    and legal jurisdiction). Changes in the assumptions used for
    actuarial studies could have a material effect on the estimate
    of the provision for casualty claims. Management believes that
    the accounting estimate related to the liability for personal
    injuries and other casualty claims is critical to KCS’
    results of operations. See also Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, casualty expense
    equaled $33.8 million and was included in casualties and
    insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income.
    Based on the methods described above and information available
    as of December 31, 2006, the liability for casualty claims
    was $114.4 million. For purposes of earnings sensitivity
    analysis, if the December 31, 2006 reserve were adjusted
    (increased or decreased) by 10%, casualty expense would change
    $11.4 million.

Provision
    for Income Taxes.

Deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of KCS.
    For financial reporting purposes, management determines the
    current tax liability, as well as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, in accordance with the liability method of
    accounting for income taxes as specified in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109

“

Accounting for Income Taxes.” The provision
    for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently
    payable and deferred into the future. Currently payable income
    taxes represent the liability related to KCS’ U.S., state
    and Mexican income tax returns for the current year and
    anticipated tax payments resulting from income tax audits while
    the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in
    the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on
    the balance sheet. The changes in deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences
    between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for
    tax purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates that
    management estimates will be in effect when these differences
    reverse. In addition, the tax provision for Mexico is further
    complicated by the impacts of inflation as well as the exchange
    rate, both of which can have a significant impact on the
    calculation. In addition to estimating the future tax rates
    applicable to the reversal of tax differences, management must
    also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences
    are permanent or temporary. If the differences are temporary,
    management must estimate the timing of their reversal, and
    whether taxable operating income in future periods will be
    sufficient



to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets of KCS.
    Accordingly, management believes that the estimates related to
    the provision for income taxes is critical to the Company’s
    results of operations.

Other.

Derivative Instruments.

KCS does not engage in
    the trading of derivatives. Management’s objective for
    using derivative instruments is to manage fuel and currency risk
    to mitigate the impact of their fluctuations. KCS accounts for
    derivative transactions under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended, as set
    forth in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In general, the Company enters into derivative transactions in
    limited situations based on management’s assessment of
    current market conditions and perceived risks. Management
    intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions in
    order to manage risks and exposures associated with various
    operations, and in so doing, may enter into such transactions
    more frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

Fuel expense is
    a significant component of operating expenses. Fuel costs are
    affected by (i) traffic levels, (ii) efficiency of
    operations and equipment, and (iii) fuel market conditions.
    KCS enters into transactions, such as forward purchase
    commitments and commodity swap transactions from time to time,
    to stabilize the price for future fuel purchases and protect
    operating results against adverse fuel price fluctuations. These
    derivative instruments hedge against fluctuations in the price
    of No. 2 Gulf Coast Heating Oil, the commodity on which the
    Company’s diesel fuel prices are based. The use of certain
    risk management strategies enables risk to be reduced related to
    rising diesel fuel prices. On December 31, 2006, KCS was
    party to fuel swap agreements for 1.3 million gallons of
    fuel.

Foreign Exchange Matters.

KCSM uses the dollar
    as its functional currency. Earnings from KCSM included in
    results of operations reflect any transaction gains and losses
    that KCSM records in the process of translating certain
    transactions from pesos to dollars. KCS follows the requirements
    outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation”, and
    related authoritative guidance. The Company continues to
    evaluate existing alternatives with respect to utilizing foreign
    currency instruments to hedge the dollar investment in KCSM as
    market conditions change or exchange rates fluctuate. As of
    December 31, 2006, KCSM did not have any outstanding
    forward contracts.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are
    of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
    Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
    current and former employees for job related injuries and by
    third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS
    aggressively defends these matters and has established liability
    reserves that management believes are adequate to cover expected
    costs. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any
    legal proceeding, in the opinion of the Company’s
    management, other than those proceedings described in detail
    below, such proceedings and actions should not, individually, or
    in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition.

Reinsurance Litigation.

As the Company has
    previously reported, insurance companies who provided insurance
    to the Company filed an action in federal court in Vermont
    (“the Reinsurance Litigation”) seeking a declaration
    that they have no obligation to indemnify the Company concerning
    a particular casualty claim. That claim,

Kemp,
    et al v. The Kansas City Southern Railway Company, et
    al

, in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri
    (“the Kemp Litigation”) went to trial in September
    2006. The Company reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in
    the Kemp Litigation. The Company has also reached settlements
    with various parties, including several of the insurance
    companies involved in the Reinsurance Litigation, to indemnify
    the Company for a significant portion of the settlement. The
    Kemp settlement is fully reflected in the Company’s 2006
    financial statements and the Company has no further risk
    associated with this litigation. The Company is however
    continuing the Reinsurance Litigation against certain other
    insurance companies, seeking to establish their obligation to
    indemnify the Company for their share of the settlement with
    Kemp.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures Concerning Market Risk

KCS utilizes various financial instruments that have certain
    inherent market risks, but these instruments have not been
    entered into for trading purposes. The following information,
    together with information included in Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 12 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K,

describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that
    have market risk to KCS.

Interest Rate Sensitivity.

Floating-rate
    indebtedness totaled $381.6 million and $440.9 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Two credit
    agreements, each comprised of a revolving credit facility and a
    term loan facility, contain variable rate debt which accrues
    interest based on target interest indexes (London Interbank
    Offered Rate — “LIBOR” or an alternative
    base rate) plus an applicable spread, as set forth in each
    credit agreement. Given the balance of $381.6 million of
    variable rate debt at December 31, 2006, KCS is sensitive
    to fluctuations in interest rates. For example, a hypothetical
    100 basis points increase in each of the respective target
    interest indexes would result in additional interest expense of
    $3.8 million on an annualized basis for the floating-rate
    instruments issued by the Company as of December 31, 2006.

Based upon the borrowing rates available to KCS and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of the long-term debt was
    approximately $1,814.1 million at December 31, 2006,
    and $1,938.6 million at December 31, 2005.

Commodity Price Sensitivity.

As described in
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Other — Derivative Instruments” of this

Form 10-K,

KCS periodically participates in diesel fuel purchase commitment
    and swap transactions. At December 31, 2006, KCS was party
    to fuel swap agreements for 1.3 million gallons. Subsequent
    to December 31, 2006, KCS entered into fuel swap agreements
    for another 1.3 million gallons. The Company also holds
    fuel inventories for use in operations. These inventories are
    not material to KCS’ overall financial position. With the
    exception of the fuel currently hedged under fuel swap
    transactions for 2007, fuel costs are expected to mirror market
    conditions in 2007. KCS also cushions the impact of increased
    fuel costs through fuel surcharge revenues from customers.
    Assuming annual consumption of 145 million gallons, a $0.10
    change in the price per gallon of fuel would cause a
    $14.5 million change in operating expenses.

Foreign Exchange Sensitivity.

KCSM uses the
    dollar as its functional currency. Earnings from KCSM included
    in the Company’s results of operations reflect revaluation
    gains and losses that KCSM records in the process of translating
    certain transactions from pesos to dollars. Therefore, the
    Company has exposure to fluctuations in the value of the peso.
    While not currently utilizing foreign currency instruments to
    hedge KCS’



dollar investment in KCSM, existing alternatives are evaluated
    as market conditions and exchange rates fluctuate. For example,
    a hypothetical 10% increase in the US dollar to the Mexican peso
    exchange rate on net monetary assets of Ps.1,652.6 million
    would result in a translation loss of approximately
    $13.9 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would
    result in a translation gain of approximately $17.0 million.

Inflation.

U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles require the use of historical cost, which
    does not reflect the effects of inflation on the replacement
    cost of property. Due to the capital intensive nature of
    KCS’ business, the replacement cost of these assets would
    be substantially greater than the amounts reported under the
    historical cost basis.

Introductory
    Comments

The following Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared by Kansas City Southern, pursuant to the rules and
    regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). Beginning with the year ended
    December 31, 2005, these financial statements include the
    results of operations and cash flows of Mexrail and Grupo KCSM,
    which were consolidated on January 1, 2005, and

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Kansas City Southern is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

KCS’ internal control over financial reporting was designed
    to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management
    and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
    presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
    inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
    to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
    respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and participation of the Company’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
    conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the framework established by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

(commonly referred to as the COSO framework).
    Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
    outlined in the COSO framework.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their attestation report, which immediately follows this report.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries
    (the Company) maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in “Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A
    company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
    or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by COSO.
    Also, in our opinion, Kansas City Southern maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our
    report dated February 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Kansas City Southern:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
    financial statements of Grupo Transportación Ferroviaria
    Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo TFM and currently known as Grupo
    KCSM), a 46.6% owned investee company for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. The Company’s equity in loss of
    Grupo TFM was $2.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2004. The financial statements of Grupo TFM
    for the year ended December 31, 2004 were audited by other
    auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion,
    insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Grupo TFM for
    the year ended December 31, 2004, is based solely on the
    report of other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits, and the report of other
    auditors for 2004, the consolidated financial statements
    referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation
    as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R, “Share Based Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Kansas City Southern and subsidiaries internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
    of, and the effective operation of, internal control over
    financial reporting.

Note 1.

Description
    of the Business

Kansas City Southern (“KCS” or the
    “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was initially
    organized in 1962 as Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. In
    2002, the Company formally changed its name to Kansas City
    Southern. KCS is a holding company with principal operations in
    rail transportation.

Until the second quarter of 2005, KCS operated under one
    reportable business segment in the rail transportation industry.
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2005, with the acquisition of
    a controlling interest in Grupo KCSM, KCS began operating under
    two reportable business segments, which are defined
    geographically as United States (U.S.) and Mexico. In both the
    U.S. and the Mexico segments, the Company generates revenues and
    cash flows by providing its customers with freight delivery
    services both within its regions, and throughout North America
    through connections with other Class I rail carriers.
    KCS’ customers conduct business in a number of different
    industries, including electric-generating utilities, chemical
    and petroleum products, paper and forest products, agriculture
    and mineral products, automotive products and intermodal
    transportation.

KCS’ principal geographic business segments include the
    following:

U.S. Segment.

•

The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a
    wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary;

•

Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”), a wholly-owned consolidated
    subsidiary; which wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company
    (“Tex-Mex”);

•

Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a ninety percent
    owned consolidated affiliate.

•

Combined with equity investments in:

•

Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (“Southern
    Capital”), a fifty percent owned unconsolidated affiliate
    that owns and leases locomotives and other rail equipment;

    a settlement

agreement with the Mexican government resolving the
    controversies and disputes between the companies and the Mexican
    government concerning the payment of a VAT refund to KCSM and
    the purchase of the remaining shares of KCSM owned by the
    Mexican government. As a result of this settlement, KCS wholly
    owns Grupo KCSM and KCSM. Grupo KCSM and KCSM constituted 53% of
    consolidated assets at December 31, 2006 and 47% of 2006
    consolidated revenues.

The KCSM Concession.

KCSM holds a Concession
    from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusive through
    2027, subject to certain trackage rights) which is renewable
    under certain conditions for additional periods of up to
    50 years. The Concession is to provide freight
    transportation services over rail lines which are a primary
    commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system. These lines
    include the shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico
    City and Laredo, Texas and serve most of Mexico’s principal
    industrial cities and three of its major shipping ports. KCSM
    has the right to use, but does not own, all track and buildings
    that are necessary for the rail lines’ operation. The
    Company is obligated to maintain the right of way, track
    structure, buildings and related maintenance facilities to the
    operational standards specified in the concession agreement and
    to return the assets in that condition at the end of the
    Concession period. KCSM is required to pay the Mexican
    government a concession duty equal to 0.5% of gross revenues
    during the first 15 years of the concession period and
    1.25% of such revenues during the remainder of the period.

Under the Concession and Mexican law, the Company may freely set
    rates unless the Mexican government determines that there is no
    effective competition in Mexico’s rail industry. KCSM is
    required to provide railroad services to all users on a fair and
    non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and
    safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican
    government. In the event that rates charged are higher than the
    registered rates, KCSM must reimburse customers with interest,
    and risk the revocation of the Concession.

Mexican railroad services law and regulations and the Concession
    establish several circumstances under which the Concession will
    terminate: revocation by the Mexican government, statutory
    appropriation, or KCSM’s voluntary surrender of its rights
    or liquidation or bankruptcy. The Concession requires the
    undertaking of capital projects, including those described in a
    business plan filed every five years with the Mexican
    government. KCSM filed its second business plan with the Mexican
    government in 2003 in which KCSM committed to certain minimal
    investment and capital improvement goals, which may be waived by
    the Mexican government upon application for relief for good
    cause. Mexico may also revoke KCSM’s exclusivity after 2017
    if it determines that there is insufficient competition.

In the event that the Concession is revoked by the Mexican
    government, KCSM will receive no compensation. Rail lines and
    all other fixtures covered by the Concession, as well as all
    improvements, will revert to the Mexican government. All other
    property not covered by the Concession, including all
    locomotives and railcars otherwise acquired, will remain
    KCSM’s property. The Mexican government will have the right
    to cause the Company to lease all service-related assets to it
    for a term of at least one year, automatically renewable for
    additional one-year terms up to five years. The Mexican
    government must exercise this right within four months after
    revocation of the Concession. The Mexican government may also
    temporarily seize the rail lines and assets used in operating
    the rail lines in the event of a natural disaster, war,
    significant public disturbances, or imminent danger to the
    domestic peace or economy for the duration of any of the
    foregoing events. Further, Mexican law requires that the Mexican
    government pay KCSM compensation equal to damages caused and
    losses suffered if it effects a statutory appropriation for
    reasons of the public interest. These payments may not be
    sufficient to compensate the Company for its losses and may not
    be timely made.

Employees and Labor Relations.

Labor relations
    in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive
    governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are
    renegotiated when they become open for modification, but their
    terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached.
    Typically, neither management nor labor employees are permitted
    to take economic

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

action until extended procedures are exhausted. Various
    collective bargaining agreements cover approximately 81% of
    KCSR employees.

Under the negotiating process for new collective bargaining
    agreements which began on November 1, 1999, all
    U.S. unions reached new labor agreements with KCSR in 2005.
    Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues
    have been negotiated on an industry-wide scale. Previously,
    these negotiations, which can take place over significant
    periods of time, have not resulted in any extended work
    interruptions. The existing agreements will remain in effect
    until new agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures
    are exhausted. Until new agreements are reached, the current
    agreements provide for periodic wage adjustments.

A labor agreement covering approximately 75% of KCSM’s
    total employees was renewed in 2005 and is effective through
    July 2007. The compensation terms of the labor agreement are
    subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and all other terms
    are renegotiated every two years. These negotiations have not
    resulted in any strikes, boycotts or other material disruptions
    at KCSM.

Note 2.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation.

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements are presented using the
    accrual basis of accounting and include the Company and its
    majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
    year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    year presentation.

The equity method of accounting is used for all entities in
    which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant
    influence, but not more than fifty percent voting interest; and
    the cost method of accounting is generally used for investments
    of less than twenty percent voting interest. The company
    evaluates less than majority owned investments for consolidation
    pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003). The
    Company currently does not have any less than majority owned
    investments requiring consolidation.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
    of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business
    combination. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the goodwill
    balance was $10.6 million which is included in other assets
    in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill and intangible
    assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are
    reviewed at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss
    would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount
    exceeds the assets’ fair value. Intangible assets with
    estimable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
    over their respective useful lives. The Company performed its
    annual impairment test for goodwill as of September 30,
    2006 and there was no indication that goodwill was impaired.

Use of Estimates.

The accounting and financial
    reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States
    (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Management reviews its estimates, including
    those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets,
    as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental
    remediation, casualty claims, and income taxes. Changes in facts
    and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Currency Translation.

For tax purposes, Grupo
    KCSM and its subsidiaries are required to maintain their books
    and records in Mexican pesos. For financial reporting purposes,
    Grupo KCSM and its subsidiaries maintain records in
    U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency. The dollar
    is the currency that reflects the economic substance of the
    underlying events and circumstances relevant to the entity
    (i.e., historical cost convention). Monetary assets and
    liabilities denominated in pesos are translated into dollars
    using current exchange rates. The difference between the
    exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the exchange
    rate



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

on the settlement date, or balance sheet date if not settled, is
    included in the income statement as other income.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company recognizes
    freight revenue based upon the percentage of completion of a
    commodity movement as a shipment moves from origin to
    destination, with the related expense recognized as incurred.
    Other revenues, in general, are recognized when the product is
    shipped, as services are performed or contractual obligations
    fulfilled.

Cash Equivalents.

Short-term liquid
    investments with an initial maturity of three months or less are
    classified as cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable, net.

Accounts receivable
    are net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts as determined
    by historical experience and adjusted for economic uncertainties
    or known trends. Accounts are charged to the allowance when a
    customer enters bankruptcy, when an account has been transferred
    to a collection agent or submitted for legal action, or when a
    customer is significantly past due and all available means of
    collection have been exhausted. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $31.4 million
    and $24.1 million, respectively. Bad debt expense was
    $10.8 million and $15.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Restricted Funds

—

JSIB
    Consulting.

In connection with KCS’
    acquisition of the controlling interest in Grupo KCSM, KCS
    entered into a consulting agreement with José F. Serrano
    International Business, S.A. de C.V. (“JSIB”), a
    consulting company controlled by Jose Serrano, Chairman of the
    Board of TMM, which became effective April 1, 2005. Under
    this agreement, JSIB will provide consulting services to KCS in
    connection with its Mexico business for a period of three years.
    As consideration for these services, JSIB receives an annual fee
    of $3.0 million. The consulting agreement required KCS to
    deposit the total amount of annual fees payable under the
    agreement ($9.0 million) in cash to be held and released in
    accordance with the consulting agreement. On January 12,
    2006, the first $3.0 million annual fee was released from
    the escrow account. Accordingly the balance in restricted funds
    was $6.0 million on December 31, 2006, of which
    $3.0 million was included in current assets and
    $3.0 million was included in other assets. JSIB directs the
    investment of the escrow fund and all gains and losses in the
    fund accrue to JSIB’s benefit.

Restricted Funds — MSLLC.

On
    December 1, 2005, KCS and KCSR entered into a transaction
    agreement with Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) and
    its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad
    Company (“AGS”), providing for the formation of a
    limited liability company between the parties relating to the
    ownership and improvement of the KCSR rail line between
    Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the
    portion of the KCSR rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian
    known as the “Meridian Speedway”.

In connection with the formation of MSLLC, NS, through AGS,
    contributed $100.0 million to MSLLC, representing the
    initial NS investment in the joint venture. MSLLC commenced
    operations on May 1, 2006. NS’ initial investment,
    $76.5 million was distributed to KCS as reimbursement for
    capital expenditures incurred and paid by KCS for MSLLC during
    2006. KCS has classified the remaining balance of
    $23.5 million, as funds restricted for payment of MSLLC
    capital assets at December 31, 2006. Substantially all of
    these funds will be used for capital improvements on the
    Meridian Speedway. NS has a binding commitment to fund
    additional cash contributions of $200 million, subject to
    the terms of the agreement, reflecting an ultimate ownership of
    30% in MSLLC, once funded.

Inventories.

Inventories consisting of diesel
    fuel, items to be used in the maintenance of rolling stock and
    items to be used in the maintenance or construction of road
    property, are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Derivative Instruments.

Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended,
    requires that derivatives be recorded on the balance



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded either
    through current earnings or as other comprehensive income,
    depending on hedge designation. Gains and losses on derivative
    instruments classified as cash flow hedges are reported in other
    comprehensive income and are reclassified into earnings in the
    periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the
    cash flow of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all
    hedge transactions is recognized in current period earnings.

Properties and Depreciation.

Properties are
    stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions and
    renewals, including those on leased assets that increase the
    life or utility of the asset, are capitalized and all properties
    are depreciated over the estimated remaining life or lease term
    of such assets, whichever is shorter. The Company capitalizes
    certain overhead costs representing the indirect costs
    associated with construction and improvement projects using the
    full absorption method. Overhead factors are periodically
    reviewed and adjusted to reflect current costs. Depreciation for
    railway operating assets is derived using the group-life method.
    This method classifies similar assets by equipment or road type
    and depreciates these assets as a whole. Repairs and maintenance
    costs are charged to expense as incurred.

The ranges of annual depreciation rates for financial statement
    purposes are: road and structures — 1% to 4%, rolling
    stock and equipment — 2% to 14%, computer
    software — 8% to 14%, and capitalized
    leases — 3% to 7%.

The cost of transportation equipment and road property normally
    retired, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated
    depreciation. The cost of industrial and other property retired,
    and the cost of transportation property abnormally retired,
    together with accumulated depreciation thereon, is eliminated
    from the property accounts and the related gains or losses are
    reflected in net income. Gains or losses recognized on the sale
    of non-operating property reflected in other income are not
    material for the periods presented.

KCSR Depreciation Review.

During the year
    ended December 31, 2006, KCSR engaged a civil engineering
    firm with expertise in railway property usage to conduct a study
    to evaluate depreciation rates for properties and equipment. The
    study centered on evaluating actual historical replacement
    patterns to assess future lives and indicated that KCSR was
    depreciating its property over shorter periods than the assets
    were actually used, as estimated by the study. The effect of
    this change in estimate was a $3.0 million decrease in
    depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006.

KCSM Depreciation Review.

For the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM adopted the group depreciation
    method for consistency with KCSR. Accordingly, changes were made
    to certain historical depreciation rates. During the year ended
    December 31, 2005, KCSM engaged a civil engineering firm
    with expertise in railway property usage to conduct an analysis
    of depreciation rates for properties and equipment. The analysis
    centered on evaluating actual historical replacement patterns to
    assess future lives and indicated that KCSM was depreciating its
    property over shorter periods than actually utilized. As a
    result, depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of
    2005 reflected an adjustment totaling $5.5 million to
    reduce depreciation expense recorded in the second and third
    quarters of 2005. Concession rights and related assets are
    amortized over the shorter of their remaining useful lives as
    determined by the KCSM depreciation review or the life of the
    Concession.

Concession Rights and Related Assets.

Costs
    incurred by the Company to acquire the Concession rights and
    related assets were capitalized and are amortized over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets and rights
    acquired. Concession replacements and improvements are stated at
    cost. Major repairs and track rehabilitation are capitalized.
    Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method based
    on the estimated useful lives of the respective improvements, or
    the term of the Concession if shorter.

Computer Software Costs.

Costs incurred in
    conjunction with the purchase or development of computer
    software for internal use are capitalized. Costs incurred in the
    preliminary project stage, as well as training and maintenance
    costs, are expensed as incurred. Direct and indirect costs
    associated with the application



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

development stage of internal use software are capitalized until
    such time that the software is substantially complete and ready
    for its intended use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the useful life of the software.

Long-Lived Assets.

The Company evaluates the
    recoverability of its properties when there is an indication
    that an asset value has been impaired. The measurement of
    possible impairment is based primarily on the ability to recover
    the carrying value of the asset from expected future operating
    cash flows related to the assets on an undiscounted basis. There
    were no assets requiring an impairment adjustment at
    December 31, 2006.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The
    Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, lease and contract
    receivables, accounts payable and long-term debt as described in
    Note 6.

The financial statement carrying value of the Company’s
    cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term
    nature. Carrying value approximates fair value for all financial
    instruments with six months or less to re-pricing or maturity
    and for financial instruments with variable interest rates. The
    Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt based upon
    borrowing rates available at the reporting date for indebtedness
    with similar terms and average maturities. Based upon the
    borrowing rates currently available to the Company and its
    subsidiaries for indebtedness with similar terms and average
    maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was
    $1,814.1 million and $1,938.6 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The financial
    statement carrying value was $1,757.0 million and
    $1,860.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company records
    liabilities for remediation and restoration costs related to
    past activities when the Company’s obligation is probable
    and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Costs of future
    expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to
    their present value. Recoveries of environmental remediation
    costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
    receipt is deemed probable. Costs of ongoing compliance
    activities related to current operations are expensed as
    incurred.

Casualty Claims.

Casualty claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
    amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
    The Company’s casualty liability reserve is based on a
    study by an independent third party actuarial firm performed on
    an undiscounted basis. The reserve is based on claims filed and
    an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. While the
    ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on various
    factors, it is management’s opinion that the recorded
    liability is a reasonable estimate of aggregate future claims.
    Adjustments to the liability will be reflected as operating
    expenses in the period in which the adjustments are known. Legal
    fees related to casualty claims are recorded in operating
    expense in the period incurred.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits.

The
    Company provides certain medical, life and other postretirement
    benefits to certain active employees and retirees. The Company
    uses third party actuaries to assist in estimating liabilities
    and expenses for pension and other post retirement benefits.
    Estimate amounts are based on current and historical
    information, current information and estimates regarding future
    events and circumstances. Significant assumptions used in the
    valuation of pension and other postretirement liabilities
    include the expected return on plan assets (if funded), discount
    rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and the health
    care cost trend rate.

KCSM Employees’ Statutory Profit
    Sharing.

KCSM is subject to employee statutory
    profit sharing requirements under Mexican law and calculates
    profit sharing liability as 10% of KCSM net taxable income,
    adjusted as prescribed by the Mexican income tax law. In
    calculating its net taxable income for statutory profit sharing
    purposes, KCSM previously deducted NOL carryforwards. The
    application of NOL carryforwards can result in a deferred profit
    sharing asset for a given period rather than a profit sharing
    liability. Due to decisions by the Mexican Supreme Court in 2005
    declaring that NOLs from previous years may not be deducted,
    KCSM



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

changed the method of calculating its statutory profit sharing
    liability. KCSM no longer deducts NOLs from prior years when
    calculating employee statutory profit sharing. This change
    required KCSM to write off its deferred tax assets related to
    statutory profit sharing resulting in a charge to operating
    expenses of $35.6 million in 2005, after purchase
    accounting adjustments.

Share-Based Compensation.

Effective
    January 1, 2006, the Company accounts for all share-based
    compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R (Revised) “Share-Based Payments”
    (“SFAS 123R”). Under this method, compensation
    expense is measured at grant date based on the then fair value
    of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period
    in which the award is earned. The Company has elected to adopt
    SFAS 123R on a modified prospective basis, which requires
    that all new awards and modified awards after the effective date
    and any unvested awards at the effective date are recognized as
    compensation cost ratably over the option vesting period.
    SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
    of the grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
    should actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In
    accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
    Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior years
    have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the
    impact of SFAS 123R.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted
    for share-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) and followed
    the pro forma disclosure requirements set forth in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
    Under this method, compensation expense was recognized ratably
    over the option vesting period if an option exercise price was
    less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant.
    KCS’ practice was to set the option exercise price equal to
    the market price of the stock at the date of grant; therefore,
    no compensation expense was recognized for financial reporting
    purposes.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
    earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based employee
    compensation prior to January 1, 2006:

The Company issues treasury stock to settle share-based awards.
    The Company does not intend to repurchase any shares in 2007 to
    provide shares to issue as share-based awards; however,
    management continually evaluates the appropriateness of the
    level of shares outstanding.

Income Taxes.

Deferred income tax effects of
    transactions reported in different periods for financial
    reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the
    liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method
    gives consideration to the future tax consequences of the
    deferred income tax items and immediately recognizes changes in
    income tax laws upon enactment.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo KCSM
    on April 1, 2005, Grupo KCSM provided deferred income taxes
    for the difference between the financial reporting and income
    tax bases of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its
    proportionate share of these income taxes through its equity in
    Grupo KCSM’s earnings. Since April 1, 2005, Grupo KCSM
    income taxes are reflected in the consolidated results. Although
    KCSM has generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due
    primarily to the accelerated tax amortization of the concession
    rights. The Company has recognized a deferred income tax asset
    for the resulting net operating loss carryforwards. Management
    anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
    realized given the long carryforward period (through the year
    2046) for amortization of the Concession, as well as the
    fact that KCSM expects to generate taxable income in the future.
    The Company’s tax projections take into consideration
    certain assumptions, some of which are under its control and
    others which are not. Key assumptions include inflation rates,
    currency fluctuations and future revenue growth. If the
    assumptions are not correct, a valuation allowance would have to
    be recognized on the deferred tax asset.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo KCSM
    on April 1, 2005, the Company did not provide
    U.S. federal income taxes for the temporary difference
    between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of
    its investment in Grupo KCSM because Grupo KCSM was a foreign
    corporate joint venture that was considered permanent in
    duration, and the Company did not expect the reversal of the
    temporary difference to occur in the foreseeable future.
    Following the acquisition of control of Grupo KCSM in 2005, the
    Company has not provided U.S. federal income taxes on the
    undistributed earnings of Grupo KCSM since the Company intends
    to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United
    States.

Earnings Per Share.

Basic earnings per common
    share is computed by dividing income available to common
    shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
    the potential dilution that could occur if convertible
    securities were converted into common stock or stock based
    awards were exercised or earned. The following reconciles the
    weighted average shares used for the basic earnings per share
    computation to the shares used for the diluted earnings per
    share computation at December 31

(in thousands).

FIN 48.

In June 2006, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation 48

“

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes

”

(“FIN 48”)

,

which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    Interpretation requires that the Company recognize in the
    financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that
    position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,
    based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.

The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning
    January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change
    in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening
    retained earnings. The estimated impact of the adoption of
    FIN 48 is subject to change due to potential changes in
    interpretation of FIN 48 by the FASB and other regulatory
    bodies. The Company is still monitoring this standard and
    evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48; however, does not
    anticipate adoption will have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated Financial Statements.

EITF

In
    June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified
    Emerging Issues Task Force Issue

No. 06-3

“How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
    Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
    Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation).” This
    standard allows companies to present in their statements of
    operations any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that
    are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions between a
    seller and a customer, such as sales, use, value-added and some
    excise taxes, on either a gross (included in revenues and costs)
    or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. This standard will be
    effective for the Company in interim periods and fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company presents
    these transactions on a net basis and intends to continue this
    presentation in the future, therefore the adoption of this
    standard will have no impact on its financial statements.

Southern
    Capital.

In 1996, the Company and GATX Capital Corporation
    (“GATX”) completed a transaction for the formation and
    financing of a joint venture, Southern Capital. Southern
    Capital’s principal operations are the acquisition of
    locomotives, rolling stock and other railroad equipment and the
    leasing thereof. The Company holds a fifty percent interest in
    Southern Capital, which it accounts for using the equity method
    of accounting.

KCSR paid Southern Capital $26.5 million,
    $30.1 million and $32.5 million in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively, under operating leases. In connection with
    the formation of Southern Capital, the Company received cash
    that exceeded the net book value of assets contributed to the
    joint venture by $44.1 million. Accordingly, this excess
    fair value over book value is being recognized as a reduction in
    lease rental expense over the terms of the leases equal to
    $2.7 million, $3.6 million and $4.4 million in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company received cash dividends of $4.5 million,
    $8.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively, from
    Southern Capital.

During 2005 and 2004, Southern Capital recorded gains of
    $7.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, related
    to the sale of locomotives to KCSR, but Southern Capital
    recorded no such gains in 2006. For purposes of recording its
    share of Southern Capital earnings, the Company has recorded its
    share of the gains as a reduction to the cost basis of the
    equipment acquired. As a result, the Company will recognize its
    equity in the gains over the remaining depreciable life of the
    locomotives as a reduction of depreciation expense.

On June 5, 2002, Southern Capital refinanced the
    outstanding balance of a bridge loan through the issuance of
    approximately $167.6 million of 5.7% pass through trust
    certificates and proceeds from the sale of 50 locomotives. Of
    this amount, $104.0 million was secured by all of the
    locomotives and rolling stock owned by Southern Capital (other
    than the 50 locomotives, which were sold, as discussed below)
    and rental payments payable by KCSR under the operating and
    financing leases of the equipment owned by Southern Capital.
    Payments of interest and principal of the pass through trust
    certificates, which are due semi-annually through 2022, are
    insured under a financial guarantee insurance policy by MBIA
    Insurance Corporation (“MBIA”). KCSR leases or
    subleases all of the equipment securing the pass through
    certificates.

The remaining amount of pass through trust certificates,
    approximately $63.6 million, was assigned to General
    Electric Corporation, the buyer of the 50 locomotives, and is
    secured by the sold locomotives and

rental payments payable by KCSR under the sublease. Southern
    Capital does not have the option, nor is it obligated to
    repurchase or redeem the lease receivable or related equipment
    on or prior to the expiration of the lease agreement entered
    into with KCSR at the time of the sale. Southern Capital does
    not guarantee the lease payments of KCSR and has no obligation
    to make such payments if KCSR should fail to do so. In the event
    of default by KCSR, MBIA guarantees the outstanding debt and may
    seize the collateralized assets, or find a third party lessee to
    continue making the rental payments to satisfy the debt
    requirements.

Panama
    Canal Railway Company.

PCRC, a joint venture company owed equally by KCS and Mi-Jack
    Products, Inc., has the concession from the Republic of Panama
    to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway, a

47-mile

railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides
    international shippers with a railway transportation option to
    complement the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal Railway is a
    north-south railroad traversing the Panama isthmus between the
    Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Panarail operates and promotes
    commuter and tourist passenger service over the Panama Canal
    Railway.

The Company has invested $31.5 million ($12.9 million
    of equity and $18.6 million of subordinated loans) toward
    the reconstruction and operations of the Panama Canal Railway as
    of December 31, 2006. The loans carry a 10% interest rate
    and are payable on demand, subject to certain restrictions.

PCRC completed the financing for the reconstruction project with
    the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”), a
    member of the World Bank Group. Under the terms of the loan
    agreement with IFC, the Company is a guarantor for up to
    $4.4 million of the associated debt. Also if PCRC
    terminates the concession contract without the IFC’s
    consent, the Company is a guarantor for up to half of the
    outstanding senior loans. The Company is also a guarantor for up
    to $0.5 million of the equipment loans and capital leases,
    and has issued two irrevocable letters of credit totaling
    approximately $2.0 million to fulfill the Company’s
    fifty percent guarantee of approximately $4.0 million
    equipment loan.

Ferrocarril
    y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico Valley
    Railway and Terminal or “FTVM”).

FTVM provides railroad services as well as ancillary services,
    including those related to interconnection, switching and
    haulage services in the greater Mexico City area. KCSM holds 25%
    of the share capital of FTVM. The other shareholders of FTVM,
    each holding a 25% interest, are Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferromex”), Ferrocarril del Sureste, S.A. de
    C.V. (“Ferrosur”) and the Mexican government.

Pursuant to the concession, KCSM is required to grant rights to
    use portions of its track to Ferromex, Ferrosur and FTVM, and
    these companies are required to grant KCSM the rights to use
    portions of their tracks.

Note 4.

Acquisitions

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141 “Business Combinations”, the Company
    allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible
    and intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity
    based on their fair values. The excess of the purchase price
    over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. The fair values
    assigned to assets acquired and liabilities are based on
    valuations prepared by independent third party appraisal firms,
    published market prices and management estimates.

Acquisition
    of Controlling Interest in Grupo KCSM.

April 1, 2005 — Acquisition
    Agreement.

In furtherance of the Company’s
    strategy for expansion into Mexico, on December 15, 2004,
    the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Acquisition
    Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with TMM and
    other parties under which KCS would acquire control of KCSM
    through the purchase of shares of common stock of Grupo KCSM. At
    the time, Grupo KCSM held an 80% interest in KCSM and all of the
    shares of stock with full voting rights of KCSM. The remaining
    20% economic interest in KCSM was owned by the Mexican
    government in the form of shares with limited voting rights.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS acquired all
    of TMM’s 48.5% effective interest in Grupo KCSM on
    April 1, 2005, in exchange for $200.0 million in cash,
    18 million shares of KCS common stock, and two-year
    promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $47.0 million
    (the “Escrow Notes”), as well as $27.5 million in
    transaction costs for a total purchase price of
    $594.4 million. The $47.0 million Escrow Notes are
    subject to reduction pursuant to the indemnification provisions
    of the Acquisition Agreement for



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

certain potential losses related to incorrect representations
    and warranties, or breaches of covenants in the Acquisition
    Agreement or claims relating thereto, or under other conditions
    specified in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

In exchange for the purchase price of $594.4 million, KCS
    acquired 48.5% of Grupo KCSM (or 38.8% of KCSM). On a
    preliminary basis, the excess of purchase price over the
    historical book value of the assets resulted in a net increase
    in the basis of the assets of $199.6 million. As a result
    of the ongoing valuation of certain assets and liabilities,
    during the fourth quarter of 2005, Grupo KCSM and KCSM
    recognized changes to the preliminary allocation of purchase
    price, which was pushed down by KCS. In addition, the KCS
    purchase price was increased $4.4 million, relating
    primarily to an increase in the estimates for severance and
    relocation costs.

In connection with the evaluation of the fair values of the
    assets and liabilities of Grupo KCSM, certain assets were
    identified as having little or no value to KCS as the acquiring
    company. Because KCS acquired only 48.5% of Grupo KCSM (or 38.8%
    of KCSM) in this transaction, the allocation of the excess
    purchase price over book value of net assets was limited to the
    acquired percentage. Accordingly, a reduction in the assets of
    Grupo KCSM was limited to the acquired percentage and any
    residual was charged to expense. Grupo KCSM operating expenses
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 included
    $39.5 million relating to decreases in the basis of certain
    assets, the most significant of which was the write off of a
    deferred employee profit sharing asset of $35.6 million as
    a result of legal rulings in Mexico.

September 12, 2005, Completion of VAT/Put
    Settlement.

On September 12, 2005, the
    Company and its subsidiaries, KCSM and Grupo KCSM, along with
    TMM, entered into a settlement agreement with the Mexican
    government, resolving the controversies and disputes between the
    companies and the Mexican government concerning the payment of a
    value added tax (“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the
    obligation (“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of
    KCSM owned by the Mexican government (the “VAT/Put
    Settlement”). As a result of the VAT/Put Settlement, KCS
    and its subsidiaries own 100% of Grupo KCSM and KCSM; the
    potential obligation of KCS, Grupo KCSM and TMM to acquire the
    Mexican government’s remaining 20% ownership of KCSM was
    eliminated; and the legal obligation of the Mexican government
    to issue the VAT refund to KCSM was satisfied. There was no cash
    exchanged between the parties to the settlement agreement. In
    addition, the parties entered into mutual releases of all
    existing and potential claims relating to the VAT refund and the
    Put obligation, and entered into an agreement to dismiss all of
    the existing litigation between the parties.

The VAT/Put Settlement had two separate impacts —
    first, the resolution of a pre-acquisition contingency related
    to the April 1, 2005, transaction and second, KCSM’s
    acquisition of the minority interest held by the Mexican
    government.

Resolution
    of Pre-Acquisition Contingencies.

Both the VAT refund claim and the Mexican government’s put
    rights were pre-acquisition contingencies. Accordingly, the
    impact of the acquired asset and the resulting liability was
    reflected as adjustments to the preliminary purchase accounting
    described above. Because there was no market for Grupo KCSM
    stock, management assessed the fair value of the
    government’s shares acquired in the settlement to be
    properly estimated as the pro rata equivalent of the fair value
    of Grupo KCSM stock paid to TMM under the Acquisition Agreement.
    Based on this assessment, the fair value of the Mexican
    government’s shares was determined to be
    $305.5 million.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, KCS acquired
    TMM’s 51% interest in the VAT refund claim as settled.
    Accordingly, the preliminary purchase accounting for the Grupo
    KCSM acquisition was adjusted to reflect as an asset the fair
    value of the acquisition of TMM’s proportionate share of
    the VAT refund claim of $155.8 million.



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In accordance with the Acquisition Agreement, a contingent
    payment of an additional purchase price of $110.0 million
    became payable to TMM as a result of the final resolution of the
    VAT Claim and Put, which was to be settled in three parts:
    (i) $35.0 million in stock (shares determined based on
    the VWAP 20 days prior to the final resolution of the VAT
    Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition Agreement);
    (ii) $35.0 million in cash at time of final resolution
    of the VAT Claim and Put, as defined in the Acquisition
    Agreement; and (iii) up to an additional $40.0 million
    in stock (shares to be determined in accordance with the
    provisions of the Acquisition Agreement) payable no more than
    five years from the final closing date (April 1, 2005). The
    liability was non-interest bearing, therefore it was recorded at
    its present value based on a 5.0% discount rate, consistent with
    the stated rate of similar interest bearing notes in the
    Acquisition Agreement.

The remaining fair value of the Mexican government’s shares
    obtained in the VAT/Put Settlement, $149.7 million, was
    attributable to the previously existing 49% KCS interest in
    Grupo KCSM and was recorded as nonoperating income and was
    presented net of applicable legal, consulting and other fees of
    $17.8 million including, $9.0 million payable to JSIB,
    which became payable on final resolution of the VAT Claim and
    Put. The VAT/Put settlement gain was not taxable in Mexico. The
    Company believes, based upon opinions of outside legal counsel
    and other factors, that the VAT/Put Settlement should not be
    taxable to KCS for U.S. income tax purposes. Such position
    has not been examined by the taxing authority and it is possible
    that this position could be challenged. The amount of such tax
    would be material; however the Company believes that it would
    have the right to indemnification under the terms of the
    Acquisition Agreement.

KCSM
    Acquisition of Mexican Government Shares.

In connection with the VAT/Put Settlement, the acquisition of
    the Mexican government’s interest was accounted for as a
    purchase. The aggregate carrying value of $375.6 million
    for the Mexican government shares (23.9% effective
    ownership — consisting of minority interest of
    $256.9 million and the Association in Participation
    Agreement with a book value of $118.7 million) exceeded the
    estimated fair value of this interest of $305.5 million
    representing the purchase price.

Purchase
    Price Allocation.

The allocation of the purchase price was finalized in 2006.
    Final adjustments to the purchase price allocation did not
    materially change the initial allocation or financial results
    during the year. Settlement of severance and relocation was
    substantially completed during the year ended December 31,
    2006.

Significant components of the allocation of the excess of the
    purchase price over the carrying value of the net assets
    acquired, including both the April 1, 2005, and the
    September 12, 2005, acquisitions, follow

Acquisition
    of Mexrail.

On August 16, 2004, KCS, TMM and KCSM entered into a new
    Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of that
    agreement, KCS purchased from KCSM 51% of the outstanding shares
    of Mexrail, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KCSM, for
    $32.7 million and placed those shares into trust pending
    approval of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”)
    to exercise common control over KCSR, the Gateway Eastern
    Railway Company (“Gateway Eastern”) and Tex-Mex. On
    November 29, 2004, the STB approved the Company’s
    application for authority to control KCSR, Gateway Eastern and
    Tex-Mex. The shares representing 51% ownership of Mexrail were
    transferred by the trustee to KCS, and KCS assumed control, on
    January 1, 2005.

The aggregate purchase price was $57.4 million including
    $32.7 million of cash with the remaining amount consisting
    of net receivables and payables with Mexrail and Grupo KCSM. The
    acquisition of Mexrail links KCSR physically to KCSM.

KCS
    Debt.

Debt Obligations Related to Grupo KCSM
    Acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition
    of Grupo KCSM and the settlement of the VAT/Put, the Company
    recorded a $110.0 million liability payable to TMM in 2005.
    The liability was non-interest bearing, therefore it was
    recorded at its present value based on a 5% discount rate. At
    December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a current liability
    of $69.3 million to be settled upon final resolution of the
    Vat/Put, and $31.6 million as a non-current liability to be
    settled in 5 years.

On March 13, 2006, in settlement of the $110.0 million
    obligation, KCS paid $35 million in cash, issued
    1,494,469 shares of KCS common stock at the volume weighted
    average price (“VWAP”) of $23.4197, as determined by
    the acquisition agreement, and issued a $40 million
    five-year non-interest bearing note. At December 31, 2006
    the Company recorded a non-current liability of
    $32.4 million which will accrete at 5% annually until
    April 1, 2010 when payment of $40.0 million will be
    due.

Also, as part of the acquisition in 2005, KCS issued escrow
    notes totaling $47.0 million which are subject to reduction
    for certain potential losses related to breaches of certain
    representations, warranties or covenants in the acquisition
    agreement by TMM. The escrow notes are due April 1, 2007,
    and accrue interest at a stated rate of 5.0%. The principal and
    interest is payable in cash or in stock (shares to be determined
    based on the VWAP 20 days prior to settlement) at the
    Company’s discretion. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the Company included $50.9 million as a current liability
    and $48.8 million as a non-current liability on the balance
    sheet, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, the Company recorded a
    $9.0 million one time incentive payment to JSIB, payable
    upon final resolution of the VAT/Put claim. On March 13,
    2006, the Company paid $9.0 million in cash to JSIB.

KCSR
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    March 30, 2004, KCSR entered into a credit agreement (the

“

2004 Credit Agreement”) which was amended
    during 2004 and 2005 to result in a $125 million revolving
    credit facility maturing on March 30, 2007, and a
    $250 million term loan facility maturing on March 30,
    2008. The amended term loan facility bore interest at the London
    Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 150 basis
    points. The amended revolving credit facility bore interest at
    the LIBOR plus a spread based on the Company’s leverage
    ratio as defined in the 2004 Credit Agreement. As of
    December 31, 2005, advances under the revolving credit
    facility totaled $92.0 million and the term loan’s
    balance was $246.8 million. Revolver availability as of
    December 31, 2005 was $33.0 million.

On April 28, 2006, KCS, KCSR and the other subsidiary
    guarantors named therein entered into an amended and restated
    credit agreement (the “2006 Credit Agreement”), in an
    aggregate amount of $371.1 million with The Bank of Nova
    Scotia and other lenders named in the 2006 Credit Agreement.
    Proceeds from the 2006 Credit Agreement were used to refinance
    the 2004 Credit Agreement. The 2006 Credit Agreement consists of
    (a) a $125.0 million revolving credit facility with a
    letter of credit sublimit of $25.0 million and swing line
    advances of up to $15.0 million, and (b) a
    $246.1 million term loan facility. The revolving credit
    facility bears interest at either LIBOR, or an alternate base
    rate, plus a spread based on the Company’s leverage ratio
    as defined in the 2006 Credit Agreement. The term loan facility
    bears interest at either LIBOR plus 175 basis points or the
    alternative base rate plus 75 basis points. The maturity
    date for the revolving credit facility is April 28, 2011
    and the maturity date of the term loan facility is
    April 28, 2013. The 2006 Credit Agreement contains
    covenants that restrict or prohibit certain actions, including,
    but not limited to, KCS’ ability to incur debt, create or
    suffer to exist liens, make prepayment of particular debt, pay
    dividends, make investments, engage in transactions with
    stockholders and affiliates, issue capital stock, sell certain
    assets, and engage in mergers and consolidations or in
    sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, KCS must meet certain
    consolidated interest coverage and leverage ratios. Failure to
    maintain compliance with the



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

covenants could constitute a default which could accelerate the
    payment of any outstanding amounts under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by
    substantially all of the Company’s domestic assets and are
    guaranteed by the majority of its domestic subsidiaries. As of
    December 31, 2006, advances under the revolving credit
    facility totaled $90.0 million and the term loans’
    balance was $244.9 million. Revolver availability as of
    December 31, 2006 was $35.0 million.

On January 31, 2007, KCS provided written notice to the
    lenders under the 2006 Credit Agreement of certain
    representation and other defaults under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement arising from the potential defaults which existed
    under the KCSR indentures governing the Notes as described
    below. These defaults limited KCSR’s access to the
    revolving credit facility. In its notice of default, the Company
    also requested that the lenders waive these defaults. On
    February 5, 2007 the Company received a waiver of such
    defaults from all of the lenders under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. The Company is currently not in default of the 2006
    Credit Agreement and has access to the revolving credit facility.

KCSR has outstanding
    $200.0 million of

    general unsecured obligations of KCSR but are guaranteed by KCS
    and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.

Consent Solicitation.

On January 29,
    2007, the Company commenced a consent solicitation to amend the
    indentures under which KCSR’s

    Notes due 2009 (the

    and together with the

    solicitation was to (i) resolve an inconsistency in the
    inclusion of certain expenses, but not the income, of restricted
    subsidiaries in the calculation of the consolidated coverage
    ratio under the indentures, (ii) amend the definition of
    refinancing indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain
    related premiums, interest, fees and expenses in permitted
    refinancing indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any
    defaults arising from certain actions taken in the absence of
    such proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, the Company
    obtained the requisite consents from the holders of each series
    of Notes to amend their respective indentures as described above
    and executed supplemental indentures containing such amendments
    and waivers.

Tex-Mex
    Debt.

RRIF Loan Agreement.

On June 28, 2005,
    Tex-Mex entered into an agreement with Federal Railroad
    Administration (“FRA”) to borrow $50 million to
    be used for infrastructure improvements which are expected to
    increase efficiency and capacity in order to accommodate growing
    freight rail traffic related to the NAFTA corridor. At
    December 31, 2005, Tex-Mex had borrowed a net amount of
    $21.7 million under the loan agreement. Tex-Mex drew down
    the remaining $28.2 million during 2006. The note bears
    interest at 4.29% annually and the principal balance amortizes
    quarterly with a final maturity of July 13, 2030. The loan
    was made under the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement
    Financing (“RRIF”) Program administered by the FRA.
    The loan is guaranteed by Mexrail, which has issued a Pledge
    Agreement in favor of the lender equal to the gross revenues
    earned by Mexrail on per-car fees on traffic crossing the
    International Rail Bridge in Laredo, Texas.

On February 16, 2007, Tex-Mex and the FRA entered into
    amendment No. 1 and waiver No. 1 to the loan
    agreement, the purpose of which was to eliminate the obligation
    of Tex-Mex to provide audited annual financial statements to the
    FRA and to waive Tex-Mex’s failure to do so since entering
    into the loan agreement. To induce the FRA to agree to such
    amendment and waiver, the Company has agreed to provide the FRA
    with its audited annual financial statements and unaudited
    quarterly statements and has also agreed to guaranty the
    scheduled principal payment installments due to the FRA from
    Tex-Mex under the loan agreement on a rolling five-year basis.

KCSM
    Debt.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans.

On
    October 24, 2005, KCSM entered into a credit agreement (the
    “2005 KCSM Credit Agreement”) in an aggregate amount
    of $106.0 million, with a maturity of October 28,
    2008. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement consisted of a
    $30.0 million revolving credit facility and a
    $76.0 million term loan facility secured by the locomotives
    and rail cars owned by KCSM’s subsidiary, Arrendadora. For
    dollar loans the facilities bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread
    based on KCSM’s leverage ratio as defined under the 2005
    KCSM Credit Agreement. For peso loans the facilities bear
    interest at the TIIE rate plus a spread based on KCSM’s
    leverage ratio. Proceeds from the facilities were used primarily
    to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes. At
    December 31, 2005, advances under the revolving credit
    facility totaled $26.1 million, with $3.9 million
    remaining available under the facility. At December 31,
    2006 there were no advances outstanding under the revolving
    credit facility and KCSM had $30.0 million of availability.
    On November 21, 2006, KCSM paid down $29.0 million of
    the term loan facility from the proceeds of its


/


% senior
    notes offering. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the term
    loans’ balance was $46.7 million and
    $76.0 million, respectively. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement
    contains covenants and restrictions similar to those in
    KCSR’s 2006 Credit Agreement.

On April 7, 2006, KCSM entered into an amendment and waiver
    (“Amendment and Waiver”) related to the 2005 KCSM
    Credit Agreement. The 2005 KCSM Credit Agreement was amended to
    (i) exclude certain payment obligations accrued under two
    locomotive maintenance agreements and under a track maintenance
    rehabilitation agreement from the definition of Indebtedness,
    (ii) eliminate certain minimum and multiple borrowing
    thresholds for peso borrowings under the revolving credit
    facility and (iii) eliminate the reporting requirement to
    provide unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
    fourth fiscal quarter. The Amendment and Waiver also waived
    certain reporting requirements, including the requirement of
    KCSM to provide audited consolidated financial
    statements 90 days after the end of the 2005 fiscal
    year, provided such reports were delivered by April 30,
    2006, and compliance with the Consolidated Leverage Ratio
    obligations of Section 7.1(c) of the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement for the four quarters ending December 31, 2005,
    if compliance therewith was calculated without giving effect to
    the amendment to the definition of “Indebtedness” in
    the Amendment and Waiver,

provided

that KCSM was in
    compliance therewith after giving effect to the Amendment and
    Waiver. KCSM is not currently in default of the 2005 KCSM Credit
    Agreement and currently has access to the revolving credit
    facility.

    commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any
    and all outstanding $150.0 million aggregate principal
    amount of the KCSM 2007 Senior Notes. The consent solicitation
    expired on November 3, 2006. KCSM received consents in
    connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation from
    holders of over 97% of the KCSM 2007 Senior Notes to amend the
    indenture under which the KCSM 2007 Senior Notes were issued
    (the “2007 Indenture”), to eliminate substantially all

Income
    Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be
    reported on the Company’s income tax return, and deferred
    tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax
    assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined based on the difference between the financial
    statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by
    the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these
    differences reverse. Valuation allowances are used to reduce
    deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be
    realized.

Difference Attributable to KCSM Investment.

At
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s book basis exceeded
    the tax basis of its investment in KCSM by $563 million.
    The Company has not provided a deferred income tax liability for
    the income taxes, if any, which might become payable on the
    realization of this basis difference because the Company intends
    to indefinitely reinvest in KCSM the financial accounting
    earnings which gave rise to the basis differential. Moreover,
    the Company has no other plans to realize this basis
    differential by a sale of its investment in KCSM. If the Company
    were to realize this basis difference in the future by a receipt
    of dividends or the sale of its interest in KCSM, as of
    December 31, 2006, the Company would incur gross federal
    income taxes of $197.1 million, which might be partially
    offset by Mexican income taxes.

Prior to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Grupo KCSM
    on April 1, 2005, Grupo KCSM provided deferred income taxes
    for the difference between the financial reporting and income
    tax bases of its assets and liabilities. KCS recorded its
    proportionate share of these income taxes through its equity in
    Grupo KCSM’s earnings. Since April 1, 2005, Grupo KCSM
    income taxes are reflected in the consolidated results. Although
    KCSM has generated book profits, it has incurred tax losses due
    primarily to the accelerated tax amortization of the Concession
    rights. The Company has recognized a deferred income tax asset
    for the resulting net operating loss carryforwards. Management
    anticipates that such net operating loss carryforwards will be
    realized given the expiration dates (through the year
    2046) of the loss carryforwards, as well as the fact that
    KCSM expects to generate taxable income in the future.
    Management’s tax projections take into consideration
    certain assumptions, some of which are under their control and
    others which are not. Key assumptions include inflation rates,
    currency fluctuations and future revenue growth. If
    management’s assumptions are not correct, a valuation
    allowance may have to be recognized on the deferred tax asset.

As described in Note 4, on September 12, 2005, the
    Company and its subsidiaries, KCSM and Grupo KCSM, along with
    TMM, entered into a settlement agreement with the Mexican
    government, resolving the controversies and disputes between the
    companies and the Mexican government concerning the payment of a
    value added tax (“VAT”) refund to KCSM and the
    obligation (“Put”) to purchase the remaining shares of



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

KCSM owned by the Mexican government (the “VAT/Put
    Settlement”). All Mexican income taxes on the VAT were paid
    as part of the VAT/Put Settlement. The Company believes, based
    upon opinions of outside legal counsel and other factors, that
    the VAT/Put Settlement is not taxable to KCS for
    U.S. income tax purposes.

Tax Carryovers.

In the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Company generated both
    U.S. federal and state net operating losses. The losses are
    carried forward 20 years for federal and from 5 to
    20 years for state.

Both the federal and state loss carryovers are analyzed each
    year to determine the likelihood of realization. The
    U.S. federal loss carryover at December 31, 2006, is
    $137.8 million and will expire beginning in 2008. The
    Company believes the federal loss carryover will be realized.

The state loss carryovers arise from both combined and
    separately filed tax filings from as early as 1991. The loss
    carryovers may expire as early as December 31, 2007, and as
    late as December 31, 2026. The state loss carryover at
    December 31, 2006, is $527.9 million
    ($16.0 million of tax), of which it is expected that
    $203.6 million ($6.2 million of tax) will be realized.
    Management believes that state loss carryovers, net of the
    valuation allowance, will be ultimately realized.

The Mexico federal loss carryovers at December 31, 2006,
    are $1.5 billion (Mexican pesos of Ps16.2 billion) and
    will expire as early as 2015 and as late as 2046. The Company
    believes the Mexican loss carryovers will be realized.

Internal Revenue Service Reviews.

The IRS is
    currently reviewing the consolidated federal income tax returns
    for the years 1997 through 2002. A current income tax liability
    has been accrued for the anticipated outcome. The Company
    believes that adequate provision has been made for any
    adjustment (taxes and interest) that may be assessed for all
    open years. The federal statute of limitations has closed for
    years prior to 1997.

Series C Redeemable Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
    Preferred Stock.

On May 5, 2003, the Company
    completed the sale of $200 million of Redeemable Cumulative
    Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Series C
    Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of
    $500 per share in a private offering. Dividends on the
    Series C Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable
    quarterly at an annual rate of 4.25% of the liquidation
    preference, as declared by the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock is
    convertible into 33.4728 shares of the Company’s
    common stock. After May 19, 2008, the Company may redeem
    any or all of the Series C Preferred Stock, subject to
    certain conditions. The Company may be required to redeem the
    Series C Preferred Stock from the holders at their option
    only if substantially all of the Company’s common stock is
    exchanged for or converted into common stock that is not listed
    on a U.S. national securities exchange or the NASDAQ
    National Market (a “fundamental change”). The
    practical effect of this provision is to limit the
    Company’s ability to eliminate a holder’s ability to
    convert the Series C Preferred Stock into common shares of
    a publicly traded company through a merger or consolidation
    transaction. Accordingly, since the Company is in a position to
    control whether the Company experiences a fundamental change,
    the Series C Preferred Stock is classified as permanent
    equity capital.

Series D Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred
    Stock.

On December 9, 2005, KCS completed
    the sale and issuance of 210,000 shares of its 5.125%
    Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value
    $1.00 per share (“Series D Preferred
    Stock”). Each share of Series D Preferred Stock is
    convertible into 33.3333 shares of KCS common stock,
    subject to certain adjustments. Dividends on the Series D
    Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in any
    combination of cash and KCS common stock, as declared by the
    KCS Board of Directors, at the rate of 5.125% per
    annum of the liquidation preference of $1,000. The Series D
    Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock and to each
    class or series of KCS capital stock that has terms that provide
    that such class or series will rank junior to the Series D
    Preferred Stock. After February 19, 2011, KCS may convert
    all of the Series D Preferred Stock into common stock at
    the then prevailing conversion rate, but only if the closing
    sale price of the common stock multiplied by the conversion rate
    then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation
    preference for 20 trading days during any consecutive
    30 trading day period, and if KCS has paid all accumulated
    and unpaid dividends on the dividend payment date immediately
    preceding the forced conversion date.

Upon certain designated events (a “fundamental
    change”), holders of the Series D Preferred Stock may,
    subject to legally available funds, require KCS to redeem any or
    all of the shares, which KCS may pay in either cash, in shares
    of KCS stock or any combination thereof, at KCS’ option.
    Since KCS has the ability in this event to pay the redemption
    price in KCS common stock (which is not required to be
    registered), the Series D Preferred Stock is classified as
    permanent equity capital. The number of shares to be issued
    would be based upon the value of KCS common stock at that time
    but in no event will the number of shares issued on the
    occurrence of a fundamental change exceed 52.5 million
    shares.

On December 12, 2005, the Company used substantially all of
    the proceeds from the Series D Preferred Stock offering to
    repurchase 9,000,000 shares of KCS common stock issued to
    TMM in April 2005 in



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

connection with the acquisition of KCSM. All of the
    9,000,000 shares were purchased at a price of
    $22.25 per share or $200.3 million. The Company does
    not have a formal program for the repurchase of any additional
    shares of its equity securities.

Dividend Restrictions.

Following completion of
    the preparation of the 2005 financial statements of KCS, the
    Company determined that its Consolidated Coverage Ratio (as
    defined in the indentures for KCSR’s


/


% senior
    notes and


/


% senior
    notes) was less than 2.0:1. As a result, pursuant to the terms
    of each KCSR indenture, the Company was unable to pay cash
    dividends on its Series C Preferred Stock and dividends in
    cash or shares of KCS common stock on its Series D
    Preferred Stock. The dividends accumulate until such ratio
    increases to at least 2.0:1. See Note 16 for further
    discussion.

Stockholder Rights Plan.

On September 27,
    2005, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the
    Company’s common stock to stockholders of record as of the
    close of business on October 12, 2005, replacing a previous
    Rights Agreement that expired on October 12, 2005. Each
    right entitles the stockholder to purchase from the Company one
    one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or
    in certain circumstances, common stock, other securities, cash
    or other assets), at a price of $100 per share (both shares
    and price are subject to adjustment periodically to prevent
    dilution). The rights are traded with the Company’s common
    stock.

The Rights Plan has certain anti-takeover provisions that may
    cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire the Company without the approval of the Board of
    Directors. The Rights Plan will not interfere with any offer for
    all of the outstanding common stock that has the approval of the
    Independent Directors. The rights will become excercisable after
    a non-approved person or group has acquired, or a tender offer
    is made for, 15% or more of the common stock of the Company (13%
    or more in the case of certain acquisitions by “Adverse
    Persons”). Right holders (other than the acquiring person
    or group) may then exercise their rights at the then current
    purchase price, and receive the number of shares of Preferred
    Stock (or in certain circumstances, common stock) having a
    market value of two times the purchase price of the rights.
    Additionally, if the Company is thereafter merged into another
    entity, or if more than 50% of the Company’s consolidated
    assets or earning power is sold or transferred, holders of the
    rights may exercise their rights at the then current purchase
    price and receive common stock of the acquirer equal to two
    times the purchase price of the rights. KCS may redeem the
    rights for $0.0025 per right until a triggering
    acquisition. The rights expire October 11, 2010.

Change in Control Provisions.

The Company and
    certain of its subsidiaries have entered into agreements with
    employees whereby, upon defined circumstances constituting a
    change in control of the Company or subsidiary, certain stock
    options become exercisable, certain benefit entitlements are
    automatically funded and such employees are entitled to
    specified cash payments upon termination of employment.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have established
    trusts to provide for the funding of corporate commitments and
    entitlements of officers, directors, employees and others in the
    event of a specified change in control of the Company or
    subsidiary. Assets held in such trusts on December 31,
    2006, were not material. Depending upon the circumstances at the
    time of any such change in control, the most significant factor
    of which would be the highest price paid for KCS common stock by
    a party seeking to control the Company, funding of the
    Company’s trusts could be substantial.

Stock Option Plan.

The Kansas City Southern
    1991 Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award
    Plan (as amended and restated effective May 5, 2004) (the
    “Plan”) provides for the granting of options to
    purchase up to 16.0 million shares of the Company’s
    common stock by officers and other designated employees. Options
    have been granted under the Plan at 100% of the average market
    price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant and
    generally have a 5 year cliff vesting period and are
    exercisable

over the 10 year contractual term, except that options
    outstanding with limited rights (“LRs”) or limited
    stock appreciation rights (“LSARs”), become
    immediately exercisable upon certain defined circumstances
    constituting a change in control of the Company. The Plan
    includes provisions for stock appreciation rights, LRs and
    LSARs. All outstanding options include LSARs, except for options
    granted to non-employee Directors prior to 1999. The grant date
    fair value, less estimated forfeitures, is recorded to expense
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    weighted-average assumptions used were as follows:

The Company has not historically paid dividends to common
    shareholders. The expected volatility is based on the historical
    volatility of the Company’s stock price over a term equal
    to the estimated life of the options. The risk-free interest
    rate is determined based on the U.S. Treasury rates
    approximating the expected life of the options granted, which
    represents the period of time the awards are expected to be
    outstanding and is based on the historical experience of similar
    awards.

As of December 31, 2006, $1.4 million of unrecognized

    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    1.47 years. At December 31, 2006, there were
    2,693,217 shares available for future grants under the Plan.

Nonvested Stock.

The Kansas City Southern 1991
    Amended and Restated Stock Option and Performance Award Plan
    provides for the granting of nonvested stock awards to officers
    and other designated employees. The grant date fair value is
    based on the average market price of the stock on the date of
    the grant. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment
    terminates during the vesting period, which is generally five
    year cliff vesting for employees and one year for directors. The
    grant date fair value of nonvested shares, less estimated
    forfeitures, is recorded to compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period.

As of December 31, 2006, $11.0 million of unrecognized

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

The Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), established in 1977,
    provides substantially all full-time employees of the Company,
    certain subsidiaries and certain other affiliated entities, with
    the right to subscribe to an aggregate of 11.4 million
    shares of common stock. Employees may

elect to withhold an amount from payroll on the offering date in
    exchange for rights to purchase a fixed number of designated
    shares of the Company’s common stock. For offerings under
    the Eighteenth, Seventeenth and Sixteenth Offerings, the
    purchase prices for shares was equal to 90% of the average
    market price on either the exercise date or the offering date,
    whichever is lower. Under SFAS 123R, both the 10% discount
    in grant price and the 90% share option are valued to derive the
    award’s fair value. The awards vest and the expense is
    recognized ratably over one year. The following table summarizes

Note 10.

Profit
    Sharing and Other Postretirement Benefits

Health and Welfare.

Certain
    U.S. employees that have met age and service requirements
    are eligible for life insurance coverage and medical benefits
    during retirement. The retiree medical plan is contributory and
    provides benefits to retirees, their covered dependents and
    beneficiaries. The plan provides for annual adjustments to
    retiree contributions, and also contains, depending on the
    coverage selected, certain deductibles, co-payments,
    co-insurance, and coordination with Medicare. Certain management
    employees also maintain their status under a collective
    bargaining agreement, which permits them access to
    post-retirement medical under the multiemployer plan described
    below. The life insurance plan is non-contributory and covers
    retirees only. The Company’s policy, in most cases, is to
    fund benefits payable under these plans as the obligations
    become due. However, certain plan assets (money market funds
    held in a life insurance company) exist with respect to life
    insurance benefits.

KCSM Union Pension.

Under the provisions of a
    bargaining agreement for covered employees in Mexico, the
    Company provides a substantive pension benefit in the form of a
    lump-sum post-retirement payment to retirees who leave the
    Company after age 60. The benefit to retirees is based on a
    statutory termination indemnity calculation under Mexico law
    which is based on the retiree’s salary at the time of
    retirement and the number of years of credited service. The
    Company’s practice is to fund benefits under this program
    as the obligations become due.

Assumptions

The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs
    are selected based on current and expected market conditions.
    Discount rates are selected based on low risk government bonds
    with cash flows approximating the timing of expected benefit
    payments. The Mexico bond market is utilized for the KCSM
    pension obligation and the U.S. bond market is utilized for
    the U.S. health and welfare obligation. The expected rate
    of return on life insurance plan assets is determined using
    historical and forward looking returns for similar investments
    over the period that the benefits are expected to be paid.

The Company’s health care costs, excluding former Gateway

    in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) with a maximum
    annual increase of 5%. Accordingly, health care costs in excess
    of the CPI limit will be borne by the plan participants, and
    therefore assumptions regarding health care cost trends are not
    applicable. The following table presents the assumed health care

Multi-Employer Plan.

Under collective
    bargaining agreements, KCSR participates in a multi-employer
    benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care
    and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees and
    certain retirees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as
    incurred and were $2.6 million, $2.6 million, and
    $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Based on existing rates, premium
    amounts are not expected to change substantially in 2007 as
    compared to 2006.

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

The Company
    sponsors the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan
    (the “401(k) plan”), whereby participants can
    choose to make contributions in the form of salary deductions
    pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    The Company matches 401(k) contributions up to a

maximum of 5% of compensation. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company expensed
    $1.5 million, $1.4 million, and $1.2 million,
    respectively, related to the KCS 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.

Note 11.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings and administrative actions, all of which are
    of an ordinary, routine nature and incidental to its operations.
    Included in these proceedings are various tort claims brought by
    current and former employees for job related injuries and by
    third parties for injuries related to railroad operations. KCS
    aggressively defends these matters and has established liability
    reserves which management believes are adequate to cover
    expected costs. Although it is not possible to predict the
    outcome of any legal proceeding, in the opinion of management,
    other than those proceedings described in detail below, such
    proceedings and actions should not, individually, or in the
    aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition. However, a material adverse outcome in one
    or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse
    impact on the operating results of a particular period.

Reinsurance Litigation.

As previously
    disclosed in the Company’s quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

insurance companies who provided insurance to the Company filed
    an action in federal court in Vermont (“Reinsurance
    Litigation”) seeking a declaration that they have no
    obligation to indemnify the Company concerning a particular
    casualty claim. That claim, styled

Kemp, et al v. The
    Kansas City Southern Railway Company, et al

, was filed
    in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri (“Kemp
    Litigation”) and went to trial in September 2006. The
    Company reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the Kemp
    Litigation. The Company also reached settlements with various
    parties, including several of the insurance companies involved
    in the Reinsurance Litigation, to indemnify the Company for a
    significant portion of the settlement. The Kemp settlement is
    fully reflected in the Company’s financial statements and
    the Company has no further risk associated with this litigation.
    The Company is, however, continuing the Reinsurance Litigation
    against certain other insurance companies, seeking to establish
    their obligation to indemnify the Company for their share of the
    settlement with Kemp.

Environmental Liabilities.

The Company’s
    U.S. operations are subject to extensive federal, state and
    local environmental laws and regulations. The major
    U.S. environmental laws to which the Company is subject
    include, among others, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA,”
    also known as the Superfund law), the Toxic Substances Control
    Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the Hazardous
    Materials Transportation Act. CERCLA can impose joint and
    several liabilities for cleanup and investigation costs, without
    regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on current
    and predecessor owners and operators of a site, as well as those
    who generate, or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous
    substances. The Company does not believe that compliance with
    the requirements imposed by the environmental legislation will
    impair its competitive capability or result in any material
    additional capital expenditures, operating or maintenance costs.
    The Company is, however, subject to environmental remediation
    costs as described below.

The Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state
    laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
    environment through the establishment of standards for water
    discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous
    substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and
    solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and
    criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against
    companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or
    even permanently close non-complying facilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the
    railroad industry. As part of serving the petroleum and
    chemicals industry, the Company transports hazardous materials
    and has a professional team available to respond and handle
    environmental issues that might occur in the transport of such
    materials. Additionally, the Company is a partner in the
    Responsible
    Care

®

program and, as a result, has initiated certain



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

additional environmental, health and safety programs. The
    Company performs ongoing reviews and evaluations of the various
    environmental programs and issues within the Company’s
    operations, and, as necessary, takes actions intended to limit
    the Company’s exposure to potential liability.

The Company owns property that is, or has been, used for
    industrial purposes. Use of these properties may subject the
    Company to potentially material liabilities relating to the
    investigation and cleanup of contaminants, claims alleging
    personal injury, or property damage as the result of exposures
    to, or release of, hazardous substances. Although the Company is
    responsible for investigating and remediating contamination at
    several locations, based on currently available information, the
    Company does not expect any related liabilities, individually or
    collectively, to have a material impact on its results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows. Should the Company
    become subject to more stringent cleanup requirements at these
    sites, discover additional contamination, or become subject to
    related personal or property damage claims, the Company could
    incur material costs in connection with these sites.

The Company records liabilities for remediation and restoration
    costs related to past activities when the Company’s
    obligation is probable and the costs can be reasonably
    estimated. Costs of ongoing compliance activities to current
    operations are expensed as incurred. The Company’s recorded
    liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates (on an
    undiscounted basis) of remediation and restoration costs that
    may be required to comply with present laws and regulations.
    Although these costs cannot be predicted with certainty,
    management believes that the ultimate outcome of identified
    matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
    condition or cash flows.

Environmental remediation expense was $3.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, and was included in purchased
    services expense on the consolidated statements of income.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2006, KCS had a liability
    for environmental remediation of $7.8 million. This amount
    was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the
    studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with
    SFAS 5.

Casualty Claim Reserves.

The Company’s
    casualty and liability reserve for its U.S. business
    segment is based on a study by an independent third party
    actuarial firm performed on an undiscounted basis. The reserve
    is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but
    not yet reported. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred
    is dependent on various factors, it is management’s opinion
    that the recorded liability is a reasonable estimate of
    aggregate future claims. Adjustments to the liability are
    reflected as operating expenses in the period in which the
    adjustments are known. Casualty claims in excess of
    self-insurance levels are insured up to certain coverage
    amounts, depending on the type of claim and year of occurrence.
    The activity in the reserve follows

Based on an updated study of casualty reserves for data through
    November 30, 2006 and the settlement of the Kemp case; the
    reserves for FELA, third party, and occupational illness claims
    are reflected in the table above for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The changes to the reserve in the
    current year reflect the Kemp settlements and favorable loss
    experience in 2006.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company initiated a new
    comprehensive actuarial study of all of its casualty reserves.
    Based on that study, the reserves for FELA, third-party and
    occupational illness claims were



Kansas
    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

increased, resulting in a charge to third quarter operating
    income of $37.8 million. The charge reflects the impact of
    higher settlements for major FELA and third-party claims and
    significant increases in the frequency of these claims in 2004
    and 2005. In addition, the charge includes reserves for
    occupational illness including asbestos-related claims that were
    established on an actuarial basis for the first time.

Based on the results of the actuarial study, reserves for FELA
    and third-party claims were increased $30.3 million. The
    majority of these increases are attributable to adverse
    experience occurring since the previous year’s study,
    including an increase in the number of new claims and adverse
    development in the dollar amount of potential settlements for
    many significant prior claims.

Management believes that its previous reserve estimates for
    those prior claims were reasonable based on the information
    available at the time. The Company is continuing its practice of
    accruing monthly for estimated claim costs at levels recommended
    by the actuarial study and evaluation of recent known trends,
    and those accruals have been increased accordingly.

Disputes Relating to Payments for the Use of Trackage and
    Haulage Rights and Interline Services.

KCSM and
    Ferromex both initiated administrative proceedings seeking a
    determination by the

Secretaria de Communicaciones y
    Transportes

(“Secretariat of Communications and
    Transports” or “SCT”) of the rates that the
    companies should pay each other in connection with the use of
    trackage and haulage rights and interline and terminal services.
    The SCT, on March 13, 2002, issued rulings setting the
    rates for trackage and haulage rights. On August 5, 2002,
    the SCT issued a ruling setting the rates for interline and
    terminal services. KCSM and Ferromex appealed both rulings and,
    following trial and appellate court decisions, the Mexican
    Supreme Court on February 24, 2006, sustained KCSM’s
    appeal of the SCT’s trackage and haulage rights ruling,
    vacating the ruling and ordering the SCT to issue a new ruling
    consistent with the Court’s opinion. KCSM has not yet
    received the written opinion of the Mexican Supreme Court
    relating to the decision nor has the Mexican Supreme Court
    decided the interline and terminal services appeal. The Company
    believes that even if the rates set in 2002 become effective,
    there will be no material adverse effect on KCS’ results of
    operations. On October 2, 2006, KCS was served with a claim
    raised by Ferromex in which Ferromex asked for information
    concerning the interline traffic between KCSM and Ferromex, from
    January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2004, and an
    answer to this claim has been filed.

Disputes Relating to the Scope of the Mandatory Trackage
    Rights.

The SCT issued rulings determining
    Ferromex’s trackage rights in Monterrey in 2002. KCSM and
    Ferromex both appealed the SCT’s rulings. KCSM obtained a
    favorable ruling at the administrative federal court level.
    Ferromex appealed the ruling. The case was remanded to the
    Administrative Federal Court with the instructions to consider
    additional arguments before issuing its ruling. KCSM is still
    awaiting that ruling, but does not expect the ruling to have a
    material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
    operations.

Claims Asserted under the TMM Acquisition
    Agreement.

As part of the acquisition of Grupo
    KCSM in 2005, KCS issued escrow notes totaling
    $47.0 million which are subject to reduction for certain
    potential losses related to incorrect representations and
    warranties or breaches of covenants in the Acquisition Agreement
    by TMM. On January 29, 2007, KCS advised TMM that KCS
    intended to assert claims for indemnification under the
    acquisition agreement related to representations and warranties
    made by TMM. On February 1, 2007, KCS received notice from
    TMM indicating that TMM would seek damages from KCS under the
    Acquisition Agreement, aggregating approximately
    $43 million as well as other unspecified damages. The
    parties are obligated under the Acquisition Agreement to attempt
    to resolve their differences informally and, if not successful,
    then to submit them to binding arbitration.

Acquisitions of Locomotives.

KCSM entered into
    an agreement with General Electric Company (“GE”) on
    August 14, 2006, to acquire 30 locomotives at a cost of
    approximately $63.7 million. Of the 30 locomotives, KCSM
    has taken legal possession of 22 as of December 31, 2006
    with the remainder to be completed and delivered in the first
    quarter of 2007. The 22 locomotives where legal possession has
    been

    City Southern

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

taken have been recorded as assets held for sale at year-end.
    Upon completion and delivery of all 30 units, the Company
    will enter into a sale-leaseback transaction with the
    locomotives.

On August 25, 2006, KCSR entered into an agreement with
    Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (“EMD”) to acquire 30
    locomotives to be delivered June 2007 through September 2007 at
    a total cost of $61.5 million. The Company intends to
    finance the acquisitions with equipment lease financings treated
    as operating leases.

Letters of Intent.

KCSR and KCSM entered into
    a letter of intent with GE on September 28, 2006, to
    acquire 80 locomotives to be delivered in late 2007 through
    August 2008 at an aggregate cost of approximately
    $160.8 million. KCSR intends to acquire 30 of these
    locomotives and KCSM intends to acquire the other 50. The letter
    of intent also provides KCSR and KCSM with an option to acquire
    an additional aggregate 40 locomotives for delivery in 2008.
    KCSR and KCSM each anticipates entering into purchase agreements
    with GE in the first quarter of 2007 with respect to the 80
    locomotives. KCSR and KCSM entered into a letter of intent with
    EMD on November 29, 2006, to acquire 70 locomotives for
    delivery in October 2007 through April 2008 at an aggregate cost
    of approximately $140.9 million. KCSR intends to acquire 30
    of these locomotives and KCSM intends to acquire the other 40.
    The Company intends to finance the acquisitions with equipment
    lease financings treated as operating leases.

Panama Canal Railway Company.

Under certain
    limited conditions, the Company is a guarantor for up to
    $5.6 million of cash deficiencies associated with the
    operations of PCRC. In addition, the Company is a guarantor for
    up to $3.0 million of equipment loans. Further, if the
    Company or its partner terminates the concession contract
    without the consent of IFC, the Company is a guarantor for up to
    half of the outstanding senior loans. See Note 3.

Note 12.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company does not engage in the trading of derivatives. The
    Company’s objective for using derivative instruments is to
    manage fuel price risk and currency fluctuations. In general,
    the Company enters into derivative transactions in limited
    situations based on management’s assessment of current
    market conditions and perceived risks. However, management
    intends to respond to evolving business and market conditions
    and in doing so, may enter into such transactions more
    frequently as deemed appropriate.

Fuel Derivative Transactions.

The Company was
    a party to fuel swap agreements for 1.3 million gallons of
    fuel on December 31, 2006. Fuel hedging transactions,
    including fuel swaps as well as forward purchase commitments,
    resulted in a decrease in fuel expense of $0.7 million,
    $2.4 million and $3.0 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2006, KCS entered
    into fuel swap agreements for 1.3 million gallons.

Foreign Exchange Contracts.

The purpose of
    KCSM’s foreign exchange contracts is to limit the risks
    arising from exchange rate fluctuations in its Mexican
    peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Management
    determines the nature and quantity of any hedging transactions
    based upon net asset exposure and market conditions. On
    December 31, 2006, KCSM had one peso call option
    outstanding in the notational amount of $1.7 million based
    on an exchange rate per dollar of 14.50 Mexican pesos. The
    option expires May 30, 2007. On December 31, 2005,
    KCSM had two Mexican peso call options in the notational amounts
    of $1.2 million and $1.7 million, based on the average
    exchange rate of 13.00 and 12.50 pesos per dollar, respectively.
    These options expired on September 6 and May 30, 2006,
    respectively.

Foreign Currency Balances.

At
    December 31, 2006, KCSM had monetary assets and liabilities
    denominated in Mexican pesos of Ps2,304 million and
    Ps651 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005,
    KCSM had monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Mexican
    pesos of Ps1,088 million and Ps549 million,
    respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the exchange
    rate was 10.82 pesos per dollar and 10.64 pesos per dollar,
    respectively.

    due 2009. These notes are unsecured obligations of KCSR,
    however, they are also jointly and severally and fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by KCS
    and certain wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. For each of
    these note issues, KCSR registered exchange notes with the SEC
    that have substantially identical terms and associated
    guarantees and all of the initial senior notes for each issue
    have been exchanged for $200 million of registered exchange

Note 16.

Subsequent
    Events

Preferred Stock Dividends.

On January 12,
    2007, the Company declared a cash dividend on the Series C
    Preferred Stock and a stock dividend on the Series D
    Preferred Stock for dividends in arrears that were due
    May 15, 2006, August 15, 2006 and November 15,
    2006, and the dividend payment due February 15, 2007. The
    dividends were paid on February 15, 2007, to stockholders
    of record on February 5, 2007. The Company also declared a
    cash dividend on the 4%, noncumulative Preferred Stock, payable
    April 3, 2007, to stockholders of record on March 12,
    2007.

Consent Solicitation.

On January 29,
    2007, KCSR commenced a consent solicitation to amend the
    indentures under which KCSR’s


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2008
    (“9


/


% Notes”)
    and


/


% Senior
    Notes due 2009
    (“7


/


% Notes”)
    were issued. The purpose of the consent solicitation was to
    (i) resolve an inconsistency in the inclusion of certain
    expenses, but not the income, of restricted subsidiaries in the
    calculation of the consolidated coverage ratio under the
    indentures, (ii) amend the definition of refinancing
    indebtedness to allow the inclusion of certain related premiums,
    interest, fees and expenses in permitted refinancing
    indebtedness and (iii) obtain waivers of any defaults
    arising from certain actions taken in the absence of such
    proposed amendments. On February 5, 2007, KCSR obtained the
    requisite consents from the holders of each series of Notes to
    amend their respective indentures as described above and
    executed supplemental indentures containing such amendments and
    waivers.

Credit Facility Waiver.

On January 31,
    2007, KCS provided written notice to the lenders under the 2006
    Credit Agreement of certain representation and other defaults
    under the 2006 Credit Agreement arising from the potential
    defaults which existed under KCSR indentures as described above.
    These defaults limited KCSR’s access to the revolving
    credit facility. In its notice of default, the Company also
    requested that the lenders waive these defaults. On
    February 5, 2007 the Company received a waiver of such
    defaults from all of the lenders under the 2006 Credit
    Agreement. The Company is currently not in default of the 2006
    Credit Agreement and has access to the revolving credit facility.

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the

    financial reporting.

(c) Internal Control over Financial Reporting

    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” in
