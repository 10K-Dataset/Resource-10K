Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function. We were incorporated in
    California in April 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in July
    2000. Our principal executive offices are located at 9885 Towne
    Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone
    number is

(858) 202-4500.

Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a comprehensive
    line of products and services that currently serve the
    sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. In the
    future, we expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics.
    Our customers include leading genomic research centers,
    pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical
    research organizations and biotechnology companies. Our tools
    provide researchers around the world with the performance,
    throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
    perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable
    medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We
    believe this information will enable researchers to correlate
    genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance
    drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be
    detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for
    individual patients.

On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    Solexa, Inc. (Solexa) for 26.2 million shares of our common
    stock. As a result of that acquisition, we develop and
    commercialize sequencing technologies used to



perform a range of analyses, including whole genome
    re-sequencing, gene expression analysis and small RNA analysis.
    We believe we are the only company with genome-scale technology
    for sequencing, genotyping and gene expression, the three
    cornerstones of modern genetic analysis.

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into two newly created business segments, Life
    Sciences and Diagnostics. During 2008, the Diagnostics Business
    Unit had limited business activity and, accordingly, operating
    results were reported on an aggregate basis as one operating
    segment. In the future, at each reporting period end, we will
    reassess our reportable operating segments, particularly as we
    enter the market for molecular diagnostics.

On August 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of
    Avantome, Inc. (Avantome). As consideration for the acquisition,
    we paid $25.8 million in cash and may pay up to an
    additional $35.0 million in contingent cash consideration
    based on the achievement of certain milestones. Avantome is a
    development stage company working on developing low-cost, long
    read sequencing technology. We expect this technology, if and
    when available as a product, to have applicability to both the
    research and diagnostic markets.

Our
    Strategy

Our goal is to make our Genome Analyzer, BeadArray and
    BeadXpress platforms the industry standards for products and
    services addressing the genetic analysis markets. We plan to
    achieve this by:

•

focusing on emerging high-growth markets;

•

seeking new and complementary technologies through strategic
    acquisitions and other investments;

•

expanding our technologies into multiple product lines,
    applications and market segments; and

•

strengthening our technological leadership.

Our
    Markets

Our current technologies serve three primary
    markets:

next-generation sequencing,

mid-to-high-complexity

microarrays for genotyping and gene expression, and the
    “applied markets,” the majority of which are comprised
    of agricultural research. Next-generation sequencing is the most
    rapidly growing of these three markets. It is fueled by private
    and public funding, new global initiatives to broadly
    characterize genetic variation, and the migration of legacy
    genetic applications to sequencing based technologies. We
    believe our DNA sequencing systems, coupled with complementary
    technologies from strategic investments, including the
    acquisition of Avantome and our collaborative alliance with
    Oxford Nanopore Technologies will enable us to address numerous
    market segments with innovative solutions.

In 2009, we expect to enter the market for molecular
    diagnostics. The molecular diagnostic market is currently
    estimated at nearly $3 billion with the potential to grow
    to over $5 billion by 2012. This market assessment covers
    regulated assays and reagents, and does not factor in
    laboratory-developed tests, which account for a significant
    portion of the total market. The primary growth drivers in the
    molecular diagnostics market are the continued discovery of
    genetic markers with proven clinical utility, the increasing
    adoption of genetic based diagnostic tests, and the expansion of
    reimbursement programs to include a greater number of approved
    diagnostic tests. We believe our Veracode technology platform is
    ideally suited to provide a cost-effective, high-throughput,
    mid- to low-multiplex solution to the molecular diagnostic
    market. We are planning to submit the platform for review by the
    Food and Drug Administration in 2009.

Industry
    Background

Genetic
    Variation and Biological Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each
    parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical, or they
    may be different. These differences are referred to as genetic
    variation. Examples of the physical consequences of genetic
    variation include differences in eye and hair color. Genetic
    variation can also have important medical consequences. Genetic
    variation affects disease susceptibility, including
    predisposition



to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s
    disease. In addition, genetic variation may cause people to
    respond differently to the same drug treatment. Some people may
    respond well, others may not respond at all, and still others
    may experience adverse side effects. A common form of genetic
    variation is a single-nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. A SNP is
    a variation in a single position in a DNA sequence. It is
    estimated that the human genome contains over ten million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for
    medically important effects, it is now believed that
    combinations of SNPs may contribute to the development of most
    common diseases. Since there are millions of SNPs, it is
    important to investigate many representative, well-chosen SNPs
    simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable
    information.

Another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over- or
    under-expression of genes within an organism’s cells. A
    very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in
    complex organisms. The challenge for scientists is to delineate
    the associated genes’ expression patterns and their
    relationship to disease. Until recently, this problem was
    addressed by investigating effects on a

gene-by-gene

basis. This is time consuming and difficulties exist when
    several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at
    the same time. With the advent of microarray technology,
    thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time.

There are multiple methods of studying genetic variation and
    biological function, including sequencing, SNP genotyping and
    gene expression profiling, each of which is uniquely addressed
    in our breadth of products and services. Our broad portfolio of
    current products and services supports a range of applications,
    from highest multiplexing (for whole-genome discovery and
    profiling) to mid-and low-multiplexing options (for
    high-throughput targeted screening).

Sequencing

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases
    (A, C, G or T) in a DNA sample, which can be further
    divided into

de novo

sequencing, re-sequencing and tag
    sequencing. In

de novo

sequencing, the goal is to
    determine the sequence of a representative sample from a species
    never before sequenced. Understanding the similarities and
    differences in DNA sequence between many species can help our
    understanding of the function of the protein structures encoded
    in the DNA.

In re-sequencing, the sequence of samples from a given species
    is determined and compared to a standard or reference sequence
    to identify changes that reflect genetic variation.
    Re-sequencing studies can be performed on a genome-wide basis,
    which is referred to as whole-genome re-sequencing, or on
    targeted areas of the genome (for example, regions identified by
    genome-wide association study), which is known as targeted
    re-sequencing. This is an extremely comprehensive form of
    genetic analysis, in which every base is characterized for
    possible mutations. We believe that these underlying discoveries
    will likely feed the development of new array products for
    broader testing and biomarker validation.

In tag sequencing, short sequences, often representative of a
    larger molecule or genomic location, are detected and counted.
    In these applications, the number of times that each tag is seen
    provides quantification of an underlying biological process. As
    an example, in digital gene expression, one or more tag
    sequences may be analyzed for each expressed gene, and the
    number of copies of these tags which are detected in an
    experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being
    expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed. Similarly, a tag
    sequencing approach known as ChIP sequencing is used to
    determine the locations and extent of protein and DNA
    interactions throughout the genome.

SNP
    Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining which base (A, C, G
    or T) is present at a particular site in the genome within
    any organism. The most common use of SNP genotyping is for
    genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to look for an
    association between DNA sequence variants and a specific
    phenotype of interest. This is commonly done by studying the DNA
    of individuals that are affected by a common disease or that
    exhibit a specific trait against the DNA of control individuals
    who do not have this disease or trait. The use of SNP genotyping
    to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual
    SNP or a collection of



SNPs requires the analysis of millions of SNP genotypes and the
    testing of large populations for each disease. For example, a
    single large study could involve genotyping more than 1,000,000
    SNPs per patient in more than 1,000 patients, thus
    requiring 1 billion assays. Using previously available
    technologies, this scale of SNP genotyping was both impractical
    and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping can be used in a variety of ways,
    including studies designed to understand the genetic
    contributions to disease (disease association studies), genomics
    based drug development, clinical trial analysis (responders and
    non-responders, and adverse event profiles), disease
    predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping
    can also be used outside of healthcare, for example in the
    development of plants and animals with commercially desirable
    characteristics. These markets will require billions of SNP
    genotyping assays annually.

Gene
    Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which
    genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is
    accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary messenger
    between genes (DNA) and proteins. Variation in gene expression
    can cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease
    or predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression
    patterns between cells from different environments, such as
    normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or
    absence of a drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a
    role in these processes can be identified. Studies of this type,
    often used in drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and
    preferably tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of
    samples. Once a smaller set of genes of interest has been
    identified, researchers can then examine how these genes are
    expressed or suppressed across numerous samples, for example,
    within a clinical trial.

As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases,
    gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important
    diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is
    anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the
    sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more
    cost-effective technologies.

Our
    Technologies

Sequencing
    Technology

Our DNA sequencing technology, acquired as part of the Solexa
    merger in the first quarter of 2007, is based on the use of our

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry. In SBS, single stranded DNA is extended from
    a priming site, one base at a time, using reversible terminator
    nucleotides. These are DNA bases which can be added to a growing
    second strand, but which initially cannot be further extended.
    This means that at each cycle of the chemistry, only one base
    can be added. Each base which is added includes a fluorescent
    label which is specific to the particular base. Thus following
    incorporation, the fluorescence can be imaged, its color
    determined, and the base itself can be inferred. Once this is
    done, an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the
    blocking group that had prevented further extension of the
    second strand. This allows another base to be added, and the
    cycle can be repeated. Our technology is capable of generating
    several billion bases of DNA sequence from a single experiment
    with a single sample preparation. The reversible terminator
    bases that we use are novel synthetic molecules which we
    manufacture. They are not well incorporated by naturally
    occurring polymerases, so we have also developed proprietary
    polymerase enzymes for this purpose. Both the nucleotides and
    enzymes are the subject of significant intellectual property
    owned by us.

In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on
    microscopic islands of DNA, referred to as DNA clusters. Each
    cluster starts as a single DNA molecule, typically a few hundred
    bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow cell. We
    then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create
    copies of each starting molecule. As the copies are made, they
    are covalently linked to the surface, so they cannot diffuse
    away. After a number of cycles of amplification, each cluster
    might have 500 to 1,000 copies of the original starting
    molecule, but still be only about a micron (one-millionth of a
    meter) in diameter. By making so many copies, the fluorescent
    signal from each cluster is significantly increased. Because the
    clusters are so small, tens of millions of clusters can be
    independently formed inside a single flow cell. This



large number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously by
    alternate cycles of SBS biochemistry and fluorescent imaging.

BeadArray
    Technology

Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a
    substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to
    produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously,
    enabling large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective,
    and flexible manner. We achieve high-throughput with a high
    density of test sites per array and we are able to format arrays
    either in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard
    microtiter plates or in various configurations in the format of
    standard microscope slides. We seek to maximize cost
    effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and
    valuable samples, and through the low manufacturing costs
    associated with our technologies. Our ability to vary the size,
    shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific
    bead pools, or sensors, for different applications provides the
    flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments. We
    believe that these features have enabled our BeadArray
    technology to become a leading platform for the high-growth
    market of SNP genotyping and have allowed us to be a key player
    in the gene expression market.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology consists of prepared beads
    that self-assemble into microwells etched into an array
    substrate. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two
    different array formats, the Array Matrix and the BeadChip. Our
    first bead based product was the Array Matrix which incorporates
    fiber optic bundles. Each bundle is comprised of approximately
    50,000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into
    an aluminum plate to form an Array Matrix. BeadChips are
    microscope slide-size silicon wafers with varying numbers of
    sample sites per slide. Both formats are chemically etched to
    create tens of thousands to tens of millions of wells for each
    sample site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing a specific
    type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in
    a batch. We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a
    given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The
    particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function
    as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by
    attaching a particular DNA sequence, or a short segment of
    synthetically manufactured DNA called an oligonucleotide
    (oligo), to each bead in the batch. We combine batches of coated
    beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to
    create. A bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient
    beads to produce thousands of arrays.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact
    with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the
    wells, one bead per well. The beads in the wells comprise our
    individual arrays. Because the beads assemble randomly into the
    wells, we perform a final procedure called “decoding”
    in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the
    array. We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, a
    process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads
    in the array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding process
    is a functional validation of each bead in the array. This
    quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead
    and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure
    that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by
    including multiple copies of each bead type. Multiple bead type
    copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting
    data by allowing statistical processing of the results of
    identical beads. We believe we are the only microarray company
    to provide this level of quality control in the industry.

An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA,
    and introducing it to the array. The molecules in the sample
    bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads. The
    molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with
    fluorescent dye either before or after the binding. The iScan or
    BeadArray Reader detects the fluorescent dye by shining a laser
    on the fiber optic bundle or on the BeadChip. This allows the
    detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis
    of the sample.

VeraCode
    Technology

Our proprietary VeraCode technology platform leverages the power
    of digital holographic codes to provide a robust detection
    method for multiplex assays requiring high precision, accuracy
    and speed.



Commercially launched in March of 2007 for the research market,
    VeraCode enables low-cost multiplexing from 1 to 384-plex in a
    single well. At the heart of the VeraCode technology are
    cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in length by 28
    microns in diameter. Each VeraCode bead type is inscribed with a
    unique digital holographic code to designate and track the
    specific analyte or genotype of interest throughout the
    multiplex reaction. We believe the up to 24 bits of information
    inscribed in each code allows for an unprecedented level of
    error checking, improves the robustness of the optical readout
    process and provides a level of reliability that sets a new
    standard in multiplex testing. Unlike traditional microarrays,
    the VeraCode microbeads are used in solution, which takes
    advantage of solution-phase kinetics for more rapid
    hybridization times, dramatically reducing the time to achieve
    results. This technology enables us to serve a number of markets
    including research, agriculture, forensics, pharmaceuticals and
    molecular diagnostics.

Our
    Services

Sequencing

We have been offering sequencing services on our Genome
    Analyzers since 2007. Our services range from small sets of
    samples requiring as little as one run to finish, to large-scale
    projects, like whole-genome sequencing, necessitating multiple
    instruments running in parallel for extended periods of time.
    The breadth of applications offered includes novel custom
    products as well as all released products. These applications
    include but are not limited to re-sequencing, de novo
    sequencing, small RNA discovery and profiling, gene expression
    using tag based or using random primed RNA sampling technology,
    ChIP SEQ and methylome interrogation.

Array

We have been offering FastTrack Genotyping Services since 2002.
    Our FastTrack Genotyping Services offers all of our genotyping
    products, including standard and custom GoldenGate, standard
    Infinium and Infinium HD, as well as iSelect Infinium. Our
    projects range in size from a few hundred samples to over 10,000
    samples. Our current capacity peak is 450 million genotypes
    per day. Our customer base includes academic institutions, and
    biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

Intellectual
    Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including, as of
    February 1, 2009, ownership of, or exclusive licenses to,
    135 issued U.S. patents and 168 pending U.S. patent
    applications, including four allowed applications that have not
    yet issued as patents, some of which derive from a common parent
    application. Our issued patents, which are directed at various
    aspects of our arrays, assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing
    technology, instruments and chemical detection technologies,
    expire between 2010 and 2026. We are seeking



to extend the patents directed at the full range of our
    technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for many of
    these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright and
    trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
    innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
    our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
    ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
    processes, to preserve our trade secrets, to enforce our
    patents, copyrights and trademarks, to operate without
    infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to
    acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.

We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
    agreements and other arrangements with third parties, which
    grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing
    technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent
    kits and scanning equipment. We have exclusive licenses from
    Tufts University to patents that are directed at our use of
    BeadArray technology. These patents were filed by Dr. David
    Walt, a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our
    Scientific Advisory Board and one of our founders. Our exclusive
    licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents,
    which will occur between 2010 and 2020. We also have additional
    nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other
    components of our products. In most cases, the agreements remain
    in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be
    terminated at our request without further obligation and require
    that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect.

Research
    and Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
    since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
    engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
    chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
    software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
    complete the development of our products. Our research and
    development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
    to optimize our Sequencing, BeadArray, VeraCode and Oligator
    technologies and to support commercialization of the products
    and services derived from these technologies. As of
    December 28, 2008, we had a total of 406 employees
    engaged in research and development activities.

Our research and development expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006
    (inclusive of charges relating to stock-based compensation of
    $14.1 million, $10.0 million and $3.9 million,
    respectively) were $100.0 million, $73.9 million and
    $33.4 million, respectively. We expect research and
    development expense to increase during 2009 as we continue to
    expand our research and product development efforts.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
    life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving
    sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. These
    experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research,
    including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug
    discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and
    agricultural research. Our potential customers include
    pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and
    consumer products companies, as well as academic or private
    research centers. The genetic analysis market is relatively new
    and emerging and its size and speed of development will be
    ultimately driven by, among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and biological
    function; and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
    North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In each of these areas,
    we have dedicated sales, service and application support
    personnel responsible for expanding and managing their
    respective customer bases. In smaller markets within Europe and
    Asia-Pacific,



we sell our products and provide services to customers through
    distributors that specialize in life science products. We expect
    to significantly increase our sales and distribution resources
    during 2009 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and
    expand the number of customers that can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our sequencing and array platforms, reagent kits,
    scanning equipment and oligos. Our manufacturing capacity for
    consumables has grown to support our increased customer demand
    during 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, we began shipping
    BeadChips from our new Singapore facility. We are also focused
    on continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of
    our Array Matrices, BeadChips and FlowCells. To continue to
    increase throughput and improve the quality and manufacturing
    yield as we increase the complexity of our products, we are
    exploring ways to continue increasing the level of automation in
    the manufacturing process. We adhere to access and safety
    standards required by federal, state and local health
    ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal
    of hazardous substances.

Raw
    Materials

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw
    materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and
    biochemical materials and other supplies. While we have multiple
    commercial sources for many of our components and supplies,
    there are some raw materials we obtain from single source
    suppliers. If we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of
    those or other product components, our business could be
    temporarily interrupted. To mitigate this risk, we can redesign
    our products for alternative components or use alternative
    reagents. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our
    inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental
    inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.

Competition

Although we expect that our products and services will provide
    significant advantages over products and services currently
    available from other sources, we expect to encounter intense
    competition from other companies that offer products and
    services for the sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene expression
    markets. These include companies such as Affymetrix, Agilent,
    Beckman Coulter, Complete Genomics, Fluidigm, GE Corp., Life
    Technologies, Luminex, Pacific Biosciences, Roche Diagnostics
    and Sequenom. Some of these companies have or will have
    substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other
    resources and larger, more established marketing, sales,
    distribution and service organizations than we do. In addition,
    they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets
    we address and in some cases a larger installed base of systems.
    Each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new
    competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to
    increase. In order to effectively compete with these companies,
    we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior
    throughput, cost and accuracy advantages over competing
    products. Rapid technological development may result in our
    products or technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by
    us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more
    effective products based on similar or other technologies.
    Although we believe that our technology and products will offer
    advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these
    companies, we cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Segment
    and Geographic Information

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into a newly created Life Sciences Business Unit,
    which includes all products and services related to the research
    market, namely the Sequencing, BeadArray and BeadXpress product
    lines. We also created a Diagnostics Business Unit to focus on
    the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics. During 2008,
    we had limited activity related to the Diagnostics Business Unit
    and operating results were reported on an aggregate basis to our
    chief operating decision maker, the chief executive officer.
    Accordingly, we operated in one reportable segment during 2008.

We currently sell our products to a number of customers outside
    the United States, including customers in other areas of North
    America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Shipments to customers outside
    the United States totaled $293.2 million, or 51% of our
    total revenue during 2008, compared to $159.1 million, or
    43%, and



$81.5 million, or 44%, in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Sales to territories outside of the United States were generally
    denominated in U.S. dollars. In 2008, we reorganized our
    international structure to establish more efficient channels
    between product development, product manufacturing and sales.
    The reorganization increased our foreign subsidiaries’
    anticipated dependence on the U.S. entity for management
    decisions, financial support, production assets and inventory
    thereby making the foreign subsidiaries more of a direct and
    integral component of the U.S. entity’s operations. As
    a result, we reassessed the primary economic environment of our
    foreign subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more
    U.S. dollar based, resulting in a U.S. dollar
    functional currency determination. We expect that sales to
    international customers will continue to be an important and
    growing source of revenue. See Note 14 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
    concerning our foreign and domestic operations.

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
    significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
    is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
    highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic
    customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the
    government’s fiscal year.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of our employees and the
    environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
    materials which subject us to a variety of federal, state and
    local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
    we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and
    regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and
    fines should contamination of the environment or individual
    exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot
    predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the
    development of new laws and regulations, will affect our
    business operations or the cost of compliance.

Employees

As of December 28, 2008, we had a total of
    1,536 employees. None of our employees are represented by a
    labor union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.
    Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to
    attract and retain employees. In addition, we employ a number of
    temporary and contract employees. We face competition in this
    regard from other companies, research and academic institutions,
    government entities and other organizations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
    described below. In addition to the other information included
    in this

Form 10-K,

the following issues could adversely affect our operating
    results or our stock price.

We
    expect intense competition in our target markets, which could
    render our products obsolete, result in significant price
    reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we
    sell. This would limit our ability to compete and maintain
    profitability. If we cannot continuously develop and
    commercialize new products, our revenue may not grow as
    intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture
    and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function and other applications using technologies,
    capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
    microfluidics, nanotechnology, next-generation DNA sequencing
    and mechanically deposited, inkjet and photolithographic arrays.
    We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the
    future as existing companies develop new or improved products
    and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. The
    markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing
    technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
    needs, emerging competition, new product introductions and
    strong price competition. For example, prices per data point for
    genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and
    we anticipate that prices will continue to fall. One or more of
    our competitors may render our technology obsolete or
    uneconomical. Some of our competitors have greater financial and
    personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established
    customer base and more experience in research and development
    than we do. Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical
    companies, which are our potential customers and strategic
    partners, could develop competing products. For example, during
    the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Life Technologies (previously
    referred to as Applied Biosystems Group, a business segment of
    Applera Corporation) launched the
    SOLiD

tm

System

,

its next generation sequencing technology.
    If we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and
    rapidly deploy new product offerings, our business, financial
    condition and results of operations will suffer.

Negative
    conditions in global credit markets may result in delayed
    payments from our customers and may negatively impact our
    smaller suppliers.

The recent economic conditions and market turbulence may impact
    the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers.
    Certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely
    access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment
    of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to
    occur, our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales
    outstanding could increase. Additionally, these economic
    conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable to
    supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized
    components, which would impair our ability to manufacture on
    schedule and at commercially reasonable costs. In addition, due
    to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times,
    limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or
    other factors.

In addition, our business depends on the overall demand for
    methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. We rely in large part on the research and development
    spending of our customers, which is often discretionary, and the
    recent economic downturn has caused many companies to reduce
    their research and development budgets. If the current worldwide
    economic downturn continues, our customers may delay or reduce
    their purchases of our products and services. A reduction in
    demand will reduce our revenues and harm our profitability.

Due to
    our increasing foreign operations, fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of
    operations.

We are focused on expanding our international operations in key
    markets. We have sales offices located internationally
    throughout Europe and the Asia Pacific region, as well as
    manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Singapore.
    During 2008, the majority of our sales to international
    customers and purchases of raw materials from international
    suppliers were denominated in the U.S. dollar. Changes in
    the value of the



relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items
    required in our operations. Changes in currency exchange rates
    may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell
    products in the same market.

Our revenues from international customers may be negatively
    impacted as increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our
    international customers local currency could make our products
    more expensive, impacting our ability to compete. Our costs of
    materials from international suppliers may increase if in order
    to continue doing business with us they may raise their prices
    as the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their
    local currency.

Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could
    result in actions by the United States and other countries to
    offset the effects of such fluctuations. The recent global
    financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in
    foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may
    continue and thus adversely impact our business or financial
    conditions.

If we
    are unable to find third-party manufacturers to manufacture
    components of our products, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

The nature of our products requires customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. For
    example, we currently use multiple components in our products
    that are single-sourced. If we are unable to secure a sufficient
    supply of those or other product components, we will be unable
    to meet demand for our products. We may need to enter into
    contractual relationships with manufacturers for
    commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop
    these capabilities internally, and we cannot assure you that we
    will be able to do this on a timely basis, for sufficient
    quantities or on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we
    may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume
    manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs.

If we
    lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain
    additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our
    goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
    personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief
    executive officer. The loss of their services could adversely
    impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We will
    need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in
    molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing,
    sales, marketing and technical support. We compete for qualified
    management and scientific personnel with other life science
    companies, universities and research institutions, particularly
    those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals,
    particularly in the San Diego and San Francisco area,
    is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to
    attract and retain management and scientific personnel would
    prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our
    products or technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional expertise in
    specific industries and areas applicable to the products
    developed through our technologies, including the life sciences
    and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add new
    personnel, including management, and develop the expertise of
    existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
    growth of our business.

We may
    encounter difficulties in managing our growth. These
    difficulties could impair our profitability.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid
    and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans,
    which will place a strain on our human and capital resources. If
    we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our
    profitability could suffer. Our ability to manage our operations
    and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds
    to enhance our operational, financial and management controls,
    reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain
    sufficient numbers of talented employees. If we are unable to
    scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process
    and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we
    encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we
    will not be able to make available the products required to
    successfully commercialize our technology. Failure to attract
    and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further
    strain our human resources and could impede our growth.



A
    significant portion of our sales is to international
    customers.

Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 51%,
    43% and 44% of our revenue for the years ended December 28,
    2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
    respectively. We intend to continue to expand our international
    presence by selling to customers located outside of the
    U.S. and we expect the total amount of

non-U.S. sales

to continue to grow. Export sales entail a variety of risks,
    including:

•

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts
    receivable outside of the United States;

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of
    foreign countries into which we import our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other
    trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety
    of foreign laws.

In addition, we are also subject to general geopolitical risks,
    such as political, social and economic instability and changes
    in diplomatic and trade relations. One or more of these factors
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and operating results.

We may
    encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could
    adversely affect our business, specifically the effective launch
    and customer acceptance of new technology
    platforms.

We have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of or
    significant investments in businesses with complementary
    products, services or technologies. Acquisitions involve
    numerous risks, including, but not limited to:

•

difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies,
    products and personnel of acquired companies;

•

lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies
    and cost-savings;

•

difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;

•

revenue and expense levels of acquired entities differing from
    those anticipated at the time of the acquisitions;

•

negative near-term impacts on financial results after an
    acquisition;

•

the potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic
    partners of acquired companies;

•

claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired
    companies or other third parties related to the transaction;

•

the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of
    additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial
    portions of our cash;

•

diversion of management’s attention from normal daily
    operations of the business;

•

inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and
    policies; and

•

the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological
    advancements, or

worse-than-expected

performance of acquired companies;

Acquisitions and other transactions are inherently risky and our
    previous or future transactions may not be successful. The
    inability to effectively manage the risks associated with these
    transactions could materially and adversely affect our business,
    financial condition or results of operations.



Any
    inability to protect effectively our proprietary technologies
    could harm our competitive position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents
    and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in
    the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
    intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
    our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
    The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
    rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
    many companies have encountered significant challenges in
    protecting their proprietary rights abroad. These challenges can
    be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the
    establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights
    abroad.

The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent
    position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and
    factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary
    rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent
    that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and
    enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade
    secrets. We intend to apply for patents covering our
    technologies and products as we deem appropriate. However, our
    patent applications may be challenged and may not result in
    issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after
    they are issued. Questions as to inventorship may also arise.
    Any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable
    could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the
    related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship
    rights to our patents and applications could require us to
    obtain certain rights to practice related technologies, which
    may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we
    obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
    practicing our technologies or from developing competing
    products. There also is risk that others may independently
    develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
    patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us
    with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate lawsuits
    to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third
    party claims, which would be expensive and, if we lose, may
    cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and
    reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore,
    these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential
    and proprietary information and have taken security measures to
    protect this information. These measures, however, may not
    provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other
    confidential information. Among other things, we seek to protect
    our trade secrets and confidential information by entering into
    confidentiality agreements with employees, collaborators and
    consultants. Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or
    consultants may still disclose our confidential information, and
    we may not otherwise be able to protect effectively our trade
    secrets. Accordingly, others may gain access to our confidential
    information, or may independently develop substantially
    equivalent information or techniques.

Litigation
    or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual
    property infringement could require us to spend significant time
    and money and could prevent us from selling our products or
    services or impact our stock price.

Our commercial success depends, in part, on our non-infringement
    of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our
    ability to protect our own intellectual property. Third parties
    have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing
    their proprietary technology without authorization. As we enter
    new markets, we expect that competitors will likely claim that
    our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part
    of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those
    markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in
    the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of
    our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur
    substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these
    claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in
    defending ourselves against these claims could have a material
    adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate
    to the actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties
    making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or
    other relief, which effectively could block our ability to
    develop further, commercialize and sell products, and could
    result in the



award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a
    successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required
    to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third
    parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. In
    addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a
    reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial
    costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from
    third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions
    while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.
    Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these
    licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from
    commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of
    our products could materially affect our ability to grow and
    maintain profitability.

Changes
    in our effective income tax rate could impact our
    profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on
    interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required
    in determining the provision for income taxes. Our effective
    income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors
    including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in
    tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
    existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of
    non-deductible expenses including share-based compensation,
    changes in our future levels of research and development
    spending, mergers and acquisitions, and the result of
    examinations by various tax authorities.

If we
    are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop
    and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may
    not be able to launch or support our products in a timely
    manner, or at all.

We continue to ramp up our capacity to meet the anticipated
    demand for our products. Although we have significantly
    increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have
    plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to
    meet our business plan for 2009, there are uncertainties
    inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may
    not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For
    example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as
    we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and
    launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties
    in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand, in which
    case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product
    introductions, and demand for our products could decline.
    Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in
    manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced
    production yields. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing
    products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or
    previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that
    could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability
    to launch or sell these products, or to produce them
    economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance
    levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by
    customers.

Additionally, we currently manufacture in a limited number of
    locations. Our manufacturing facilities are located in
    San Diego and Hayward, California; Singapore; and Little
    Chesterford, United Kingdom. These areas are subject to natural
    disasters such as earthquakes or floods. If a natural disaster
    were to significantly damage one of our facilities or if other
    events were to cause our operations to fail, we may be unable to
    manufacture our products, provide our services or develop new
    products.

Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are
    controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS). Additionally, the decoding process in
    our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage
    infrastructure. If either our LIMS system, or our networks or
    storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of
    time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our
    products on a timely basis and would prevent us from achieving
    our expected shipments in any given period.



We
    expect that our results of operations will fluctuate. This
    fluctuation could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and services projects, the impact
    of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the
    difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for
    our products and services, we may experience

quarter-to-quarter

fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a
    sequential decline in quarterly revenue. A large portion of our
    expenses is relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities,
    equipment and personnel. In addition, we expect operating
    expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute
    dollars. Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as anticipated,
    we may not be able to maintain annual profitability. Any
    significant delays in the commercial launch of our products,
    unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or
    impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely
    affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline
    in quarterly revenue. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in
    our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons
    of our operating results are not a good indication of our future
    performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet
    the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our
    stock price could decline.

Our
    success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of
    markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our
    technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data
    and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are
    focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function, namely sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene
    expression profiling. These markets are new and emerging, and
    they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their
    full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation
    and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we
    are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to
    convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information
    through the analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. In addition, factors affecting research and
    development spending generally, such as changes in the
    regulatory environment affecting life sciences and
    pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs
    that provide funding to companies and research institutions,
    could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available
    or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner,
    demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we
    expect, and we may not be able to sustain profitability.

Loss
    of the tax deduction on our outstanding convertible
    notes.

We could lose some or all of the tax deduction for interest
    expense associated with our $400.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if the
    foregoing notes are not subject to the special Treasury
    Regulations governing integration of certain debt instruments,
    the notes are converted, or we invest in non-taxable investments.

We may
    not be able to sustain operating profitability.

Prior to 2006, we had incurred net losses each year since our
    inception, and in 2007 we reported a net loss of
    $278.4 million, reflecting significant charges associated
    with our acquisition of Solexa in January 2007 and the
    settlement of our litigation with Affymetrix. As of
    December 28, 2008, our accumulated deficit was
    $332.5 million. Our ability to sustain profitability will
    depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue
    and on the level of our expenses. Non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future
    acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our
    future profitability. We expect to continue incurring
    significant expenses related to research and development, sales
    and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the
    continued development of our manufacturing capabilities. In
    addition, we expect that our research and development and
    selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in
    the future as a result of the development and launch of new
    products. Although we have regained profitability, we may not be
    able to sustain profitability on a quarterly basis.



Negative
    conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity
    of a portion of our investment portfolio.

Our investment securities consist of marketable debt securities,
    including treasury bills and commercial paper with strong credit
    ratings, corporate bonds and short maturity mutual funds
    providing similar financial returns. Additionally, as of
    December 28, 2008, we had $55.9 million of auction
    rate securities issued primarily by municipalities and
    universities. These securities are debt instruments with a
    long-term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in
    short intervals through auctions. Our entire auction rate
    portfolio is held in a brokerage account with UBS Financial
    Services, Inc., a subsidiary of UBS AG (UBS) and is currently
    rated AAA or AA by a rating agency. Beginning in February 2008,
    these auction rate securities became illiquid because their
    scheduled auctions failed to settle. An auction failure occurs
    when the parties wishing to sell securities at auction cannot.
    As of December 28, 2008, the securities continued to fail
    auction and remained illiquid.

Various regulatory agencies initiated investigations into the
    sales and marketing practices of several banks and
    broker-dealers, including UBS, which sold auction rate
    securities, alleging violations of federal and state laws. Along
    with several other broker-dealers, UBS subsequently reached a
    settlement with the federal and state regulators that required
    them to repurchase auction rate securities from certain
    investors at par at some future date. In November 2008, we
    signed a settlement agreement to sell our auction rate
    securities at par value to UBS during the period of
    June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012.

The settlement agreement with UBS and the associated put option
    mitigates the risk of loss on our auction rate security
    portfolio. However, given the negative conditions in the global
    credit markets there is still risk that UBS may not be able to
    fulfill its obligation.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In the recent past, we incurred substantial costs in defending
    ourselves against patent infringement and patent ownership
    claims and expect, going forward, to devote substantial
    financial and managerial resources to protect our intellectual
    property and to defend against any future claims asserted
    against us. From time to time, we may also be parties to other
    litigation in the ordinary course of business. While the results
    of any litigation are uncertain, management does not believe the
    ultimate resolution of its legal matters will result in a
    material adverse impact to us.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of
    Applera Corporation (Applied Biosystems) filed suit in
    California Superior Court, Santa Clara County against
    Solexa (which we acquired on January 26, 2007). This State
    Court action related to the ownership of several patents
    assigned in 1995 to Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx
    Therapeutics) by a former employee (Dr. Stephen Macevicz),
    who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a
    co-defendant in the suit. The Macevicz patents are directed to
    methods for sequencing DNA (US Pat. Nos. 5,750,341 and
    6,306,597) using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe
    ligation

(sequencing-by-ligation),

and to a probe (5,969,119) used in connection with these
    sequencing methods. Lynx was originally a unit of Applied
    Biosystems but was spun out in 1992. On May 31, 2007,
    Applied Biosystems filed a second suit, this time against us, in
    the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
    California. This second suit sought a declaratory judgment of
    non-infringement of the Macevicz patents that were the subject
    of the State Court action mentioned above. Both suits were later
    consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of California, San Francisco Division. By these
    consolidated actions, Applied Biosytems was seeking ownership of
    the three Macevicz patents, unspecified costs and damages, and a
    declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of these patents.
    Applied Biosystems was not asserting any claim for patent
    infringement against us.

On January 5, 2009, the case went to trial in two phases.
    The first phase addressed the determination of ownership of the

patents-in-suit,

and the second phase addressed whether these patents were valid
    and infringed by Applied Biosystems. On January 14, 2009,
    at the end of the first phase, a federal jury determined that
    Solexa was the rightful owner of all three Macevicz patents. On
    January 27, 2009, the same jury found that Applied
    Biosystems did not infringe the ’119 probe patent and that
    the ’119 patent was valid. In August 2008, the court had
    ruled that Applied Biosystems’ two-base system did not
    infringe the ’341 and ’597 patents. Prior to the jury
    finding of non-infringement of the ’119 patent, Applied
    Biosystems conceded its one-base system infringed claim 1 of the
    ’597 patent and Solexa conceded invalidity of that same
    claim under the court’s construction of that claim. Both
    parties reserved the right to appeal the court’s
    construction of claim 1 of the ’597 patent, among other
    things.

Our Genome Analyzer products use a different technology, called

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which is not covered by any of the Macevicz patents. In
    addition, we have no plans to use any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by these patents.

    Performance Graph

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder
    returns on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with
    the cumulative total stockholder returns on the NASDAQ Composite
    Index and the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for the same period.
    The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 26,
    2003 in our common stock and in each index and that all
    dividends were reinvested. No cash dividends have been declared
    on our common stock. Stockholder returns over the indicated
    period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder
    returns.

Holders

As of February 2, 2009 we had 476 record holders and 56,709
    beneficial holders of our common stock.

Dividends

Our present policy is to retain earnings, if any, to finance
    future growth. We have never paid cash dividends and have no
    present intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable
    future. In addition, the



indenture for our convertible senior notes due 2014, which are
    convertible into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of
    our common stock, requires us to increase the conversion rate
    applicable to the notes if we pay any cash dividends.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities by the Issuer

On October 23, 2008, our board of directors authorized a
    $120.0 million stock repurchase program, which was
    announced October 24, 2008. The following table summarizes

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

The purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to
    provide an overview of the business to help facilitate an
    understanding of significant factors influencing our historical
    operating results, financial condition and cash flows and also
    to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known
    trends, events, or uncertainties that may impact our future
    results. The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with “Item 6. Selected Financial
    Data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes
    thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, strategies,
    objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources.
    Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “predict,” “project”
    or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words,
    may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of
    these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not
    forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include,
    among others, statements regarding the integration of our
    acquired technologies with our existing technology, the
    commercial launch of new products and the duration which our
    existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our
    operating activities.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown
    risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate
    assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those expected or implied by the forward looking
    statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these
    differences include those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere. The risk
    factors and other cautionary statements made in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

should be read as applying to all related forward-looking
    statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function. Using our proprietary
    technologies, we provide a comprehensive line of products and
    services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and
    gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the
    market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading
    genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic
    institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology
    companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with
    the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
    necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to
    extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics
    and proteomics. We believe this information will enable
    researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological
    function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical
    research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit
    better choices of drugs for individual patients.

On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Solexa
    for 26.2 million shares of our common stock. As a result of
    that acquisition, we develop and commercialize genetic analysis
    technologies used to perform a range of analyses, including
    whole genome re-sequencing, gene expression analysis and small
    RNA analysis. We believe we are the only company with
    genome-scale technology for sequencing, genotyping and gene
    expression, the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis.

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into two newly created business segments, Life
    Sciences and Diagnostics. During 2008, the Diagnostics Business
    Unit had limited business activity and, accordingly, operating
    results were reported on an aggregate basis as one operating
    segment. In the future, at each reporting period end, we will
    reassess our reportable operating segments, particularly as we
    enter the market for molecular diagnostics.

On August 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of
    Avantome. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid
    $25.8 million in cash and may pay up to an additional
    $35.0 million in contingent cash consideration based on the
    achievement of certain milestones. Avantome is a development
    stage company working on developing low-cost, long read
    sequencing technology. We expect this technology, if and when
    available as a product, to have applicability to both the
    research and diagnostic markets.



Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of
    seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns. Any
    significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay
    of commercial acceptance of new products, unfavorable sales
    trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other
    factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue
    growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. Due
    to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income
    or loss, we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating
    results are not a good indication of our future performance.

As of December 28, 2008, our accumulated deficit was
    $332.5 million and total stockholders’ equity was
    $848.6 million. Our losses have principally occurred as a
    result of acquired in-process research and development
    (IPR&D) charges of $24.7 million related to our
    acquisition of Avantome in 2008 and $303.4 million related
    to our acquisition of Solexa in 2007, the substantial resources
    required for the research, development and manufacturing

scale-up

effort required to commercialize our products and services and a
    charge of $54.5 million in 2007 primarily related to
    settlement of our litigation with Affymetrix. We expect to
    continue to incur substantial costs for research and development
    over the next several years. We will also need to increase our
    selling, general and administrative costs as we build up our
    sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the
    sale of systems, other products and services.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical
    experience and various other assumptions it believes to be
    reasonable. Although these estimates are based on
    management’s best knowledge of current events and actions
    that may impact us in the future, actual results may be
    different from the estimates. Our critical accounting policies
    are those that affect our financial statements materially and
    involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by
    management. Management has discussed the development and
    selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit
    committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has
    reviewed the disclosure. Our accounting policies are more fully
    described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and
    services. Product revenue consists of sales of arrays, reagents,
    flow cells, instrumentation, oligonucleotides (oligos) and
    associated freight charges. Service and other revenue consists
    of revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing
    services, extended warranty sales and amounts earned under
    research agreements with government grants, which are recognized
    in the period during which the related costs are incurred.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines
    established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

. Under SAB No. 104, revenue
    cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been
    met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
    to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured. All revenue is recorded net of any
    applicable allowances for returns or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    Revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized
    when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping or
    sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer.



In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based
    on future performance or a right of return exists, we defer
    revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and
    determinable. We assess collectibility based on a number of
    factors, including past transaction history with the customer
    and the creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
    Changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of
    SAB No. 104 might result in a change in the timing or
    amount of revenue recognized.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. We also sell separately priced maintenance (extended
    warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or two years,
    upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for
    extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
    the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an increase in
    warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products
    were greater than our estimates, gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

While the majority of our sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, we do enter into agreements that contain
    multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to
    determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
    deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should
    be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be
    allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize
    revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue
    should be recognized. We recognize revenue for delivered
    elements only when we determine that the fair values of
    undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties
    regarding customer acceptance.

Investments

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157,

Fair
    Value Measurement

. In February 2008, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position
    (FSP)

No. SFAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    provides a one-year deferral of the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least
    annually. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB FSP

SFAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active

. The FSP clarifies the
    application of FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

, in a market that is not active and provides an
    example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair
    value of a financial asset when the market for that financial
    asset is not active.

We determine fair value of our financial assets and liabilities
    in accordance with SFAS No. 157 and

157-3.

Fair
    value is defined under SFAS No. 157 as the exchange
    price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
    market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value under
    SFAS No. 157 must maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard
    describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of
    inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the
    last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices
    for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
    are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
    full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.



In using this fair value hierarchy and the framework established
    by SFAS No. 157, management may be required to make
    assumptions of pricing by market participants and assumptions
    about risk, specifically when using unobservable inputs to
    determine fair value. These assumptions are judgmental in nature
    and may significantly affect our results of operations.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
    required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
    regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
    receivables are outstanding, review historical loss rates and
    assess current economic trends that may impact the level of
    credit losses in the future. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses.
    However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the
    financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that
    our reserves will continue to be adequate.

Inventory
    Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
    obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
    realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
    market conditions and the release of new products that will
    supersede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
    obsolete products and components, taking into account product
    life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality
    issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels.
    If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated,
    additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
    intellectual property matters. Based on the information
    available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation
    with our legal counsel, we assess the likelihood of any adverse
    judgments or outcomes of these matters, as well as the potential
    ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably
    estimable, we will record a liability and an expense for the
    estimated loss.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Asset Valuation

We make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of
    goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and
    litigation settlements.

In determining the carrying amounts of our goodwill and
    intangible assets arising from acquisitions, we use the purchase
    method of accounting. The purchase method of accounting requires
    extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate
    the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D. Goodwill and
    intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
    amortized, but are subject to at least annual impairment tests.
    The amounts and useful lives assigned to other acquired
    intangible assets impact future amortization, and the amount
    assigned to IPR&D is expensed immediately.

Determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible
    assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires
    the exercise of judgment. While there are a number of different
    generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of
    intangible assets, one method used by management is the
    discounted cash flow method. This method requires significant
    management judgment to forecast the future operating results
    used in this type of analysis. In addition, other significant
    estimates are required such as residual growth rates and
    discount factors. The estimates we use to value and amortize
    intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates
    that we use to manage our business and are based on available
    historical information and industry estimates and averages.
    These judgments can significantly affect our net operating
    results. Our judgments can also change with respect to the
    estimated life of intangible assets which could increase or
    decrease related amortization expense.



SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be
    assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques.
    If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure
    the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as in a business combination. Determining the fair value
    of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often
    involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These
    estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on
    whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the
    magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market
    comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and
    assumptions, including projection and timing of future cash
    flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future
    cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate
    market comparables, and determination of whether a premium or
    discount should be applied to comparables. It is reasonably
    possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets
    may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and
    estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the
    original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these
    assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. We have
    performed our annual test of goodwill as of May 30, 2008
    noting no impairment. No indicators have arisen since
    management’s assessment on May 30, 2008 that would
    require further assessment.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

if indicators
    of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the
    affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying
    value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted
    future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, we
    measure the future discounted cash flows associated with the use
    of the asset and adjust the value of the asset accordingly.
    Certain estimates and assumptions are used in determining the
    fair value of long-lived assets. These estimates and assumptions
    are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on
    the determination of the recognition of an impairment charge and
    the magnitude of any such change. If our actual results, or the
    plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are
    lower than the original estimates used to assess the
    recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional
    impairment charges.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation
    cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s
    fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
    option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly
    judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates,
    and expected option life. If any of these assumptions used in
    the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation
    expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded
    in the current period.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis, and includes a review of all available positive and
    negative evidence. Factors reviewed include projections of
    pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, determination
    of cumulative pre-tax book income after



permanent differences, history of earnings, and reliability of
    forecasting. As of December 28, 2008, we have maintained a
    valuation allowance only against certain U.S. and foreign
    deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the
    “more likely than not” threshold required under
    SFAS No. 109.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recognize
    excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation to
    stockholders’ equity only when realized. When assessing
    whether excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation
    have been realized, we follow the

with-and-without

approach, excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires that we
    recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income
    tax expense.

Product revenue consists of revenue from the sale of
    consumables, instruments, oligos and associated freight charges.
    The increase in product revenue was driven primarily by sales of
    our Infinium BeadChips, sequencing systems and sequencing
    consumables. Consumables and instruments constituted 63% and 35%
    of product revenue for the year ended December 28, 2008,
    respectively, compared to 59% and 37% for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, respectively.

Consumable revenue increased by $140.2 million over prior
    year. Growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to
    strong demand for our Infinium and sequencing products, which
    led to increased sales of $104.8 million and
    $35.4 million, respectively. The increase in revenue
    associated with our Infinium products can be mainly attributed
    to the strong demand for our Infinium High-Density BeadChips,
    particularly the Human610-Quad, which we began shipping during
    the first quarter of 2008. Of the overall increase in Infinium
    BeadChip sales, approximately 79% is due to new product
    introductions with higher average selling prices, while the
    remaining 21% can be attributed to increased volume. The
    increase in sequencing consumables is primarily attributable to
    the growth in our installed base of instruments and the
    progression of customer labs ramping to production scale.

Instrument revenue increased by $64.8 million over prior
    year, of which $63.0 million was due to increased sales of
    our sequencing systems. This increase in revenue can be
    primarily attributed to shipments of our second generation
    Genome Analyzer, the Genome Analyzer II (GAII).
    Additionally, during the second quarter of 2008, we launched the
    iScan System, our next-generation BeadChip scanner to replace
    the BeadArray Reader. Any increase in revenue resulting from
    shipments of this new system was offset by a reduction in sales
    of our BeadArray Reader as we stopped manufacturing this product
    upon the launch of our iScan System.

We expect to see continued growth in product revenue, which can
    be mainly attributed to the anticipated launch of several new
    products, sales of existing products and the growth of our
    installed base of instruments.

Service and other revenue includes revenue generated from
    genotyping and sequencing service contracts, extended warranty
    contracts, and research revenue. The increase in service and
    other revenue is primarily due to an increase of
    $3.1 million in extended warranty sales coupled with an
    increase of $2.0 million in sequencing service contracts.
    This increase was substantially offset by a decline of
    $4.7 million in our Fast Track genotyping service contracts
    as we shift more towards CSPro certified customers. CSPro is a
    collaborative program through which we certify third party
    service partners using our products to ensure delivery of
    performance and data quality equivalent to that available from
    our internal service offering. The decline in service revenue as
    a result of the shift to CSPro certified customers has been
    offset by the resulting increase in our consumable sales to
    these third party service providers. If product sales increase,
    we expect to see continued increases in the sale of our extended
    warranty contracts. We also expect sales from SNP genotyping and
    sequencing service contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and
    quarterly basis, depending on the mix, the number of contracts
    completed and the success of our certified service providers.
    The timing of



completion of SNP genotyping and sequencing service contracts is
    highly dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering
    the SNPs and samples to us.

Cost of revenue, which excludes impairment of manufacturing
    equipment and amortization of intangible assets, represents
    manufacturing costs incurred in the production process,
    including component materials, assembly labor and overhead,
    installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as
    costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing
    services on behalf of our customers.

The increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by
    higher instrument and consumable sales. Cost of product revenue
    as a percentage of related revenue was 36% for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 compared to 37% for the year ended
    December 30, 2007. The decrease is primarily due to
    favorable product mix driven by increased sales of our new
    High-Density Infinium Beadchips, with higher average selling
    prices as compared to the Infinium Beadchips sold in the prior
    year. This was partially offset by increased provisions for
    inventory obsolescence of $7.2 million for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 compared to $1.9 million for the
    year ended December 30, 2007. The increase in the inventory
    reserve is primarily associated with product transitions. During
    the year, we recorded reserves for product obsolescence
    associated with the launch of our new Infinium Beadchips and the
    launch of a new sequencing kit. Instrument cost of sales as a
    percentage of related revenue increased slightly over the prior
    year due to lower average selling prices mainly associated with
    promotional campaigns as we launched our next generation
    Beadarray Reader, the iScan in the first half of 2008.

Cost of service and other revenue increased over the prior year
    primarily due to higher extended warranty contract revenue. Cost
    of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue
    stayed consistent at 31%.

Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue
    decreased to 17% for the year ended December 28, 2008
    compared to 20% for the year ended December 30, 2007.
    However, there was an overall increase in research and

    support our BeadArray technology research activities increased
    $10.4 million for the year ended December 28, 2008
    compared to the year ended December 30, 2007, primarily due
    to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses, increased
    lab and material expenses associated with the establishment of
    our manufacturing facility in Singapore and the development of
    new products. The continued development of our Sequencing
    technology resulted in increased research and development
    expenditures of $9.1 million for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 30, 2007. In addition, non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense increased by $4.1 million compared to
    the year ended December 30, 2007. Accrued compensation
    expense of $1.5 million



associated with contingent consideration for the Avantome
    acquisition completed on August 1, 2008 and expenses
    related to the development of our newly created Diagnostics
    Business Unit of $0.9 million also contributed to the
    increase in research and development expense for the year ended
    December 28, 2008.

We believe a substantial investment in research and development
    is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into
    additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and

    $4.8 million variance is comprised of increases to
    non-personnel-related costs of $2.9 million, consisting
    mainly of sales and marketing activities for our existing and
    new products and an increase of $1.9 million of non-cash
    stock-based compensation expense.

General and administrative expense increased $12.7 million
    during the year ended December 28, 2008 compared to the

    coupled with a change in our foreign entity functional currency
    designation from the local currency to the U.S. dollar
    beginning the third quarter of 2008. As a result of this change,
    in the third quarter we began re-measuring our foreign

    ended December 30, 2007, the provision was reduced by
    $17.1 million as a result of the release of the valuation
    allowance against a significant portion of our
    U.S. deferred tax assets.

As of December 28, 2008, we had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    $87.7 million and $148.3 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2025 and 2013, respectively, unless

    $12.6 million and $13.9 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively, unless

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant
    future changes in our ownership structure. These annual
    limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses
    and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to
    Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax
    assets as of December 28, 2008.

Based on the available evidence as of December 28, 2008, we
    were not able to conclude it was more likely than not certain
    U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized.
    Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of
    $2.8 million and $12.4 million against certain
    U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively. At
    December 30, 2007, we concluded that it was more likely
    than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets
    will be realized and, accordingly, we released a portion of our
    valuation allowance, $17.1 million, of which was recorded
    as a reduction to the tax provision.

    Consumables and instruments constituted 59% and 37% of product
    revenue for the year ended December 30, 2007, respectively,
    compared to 64% and 28% for the year ended December 31,
    2006, respectively. The change in sales associated with our
    product mix is due to increased sales in instruments primarily
    attributable to the Genome Analyzer, which was introduced during
    the first quarter of 2007. Growth in consumable revenue was
    primarily attributable to strong demand for our Infinium
    products.

Consumable revenue increased by $93.6 million over prior
    year, of which $81.1 million primarily represents increased
    sales volume of our Infinium products. The increase in revenue
    associated with our Infinium products can be mainly attributed
    to our HumanHap family of BeadChips, the Human 1M DNA Analysis
    BeadChip and our iSelect Infinium BeadChips for more focused
    content applications. Of the overall increase in Infinium
    BeadChip sales, approximately 82% is due to a higher volume of
    shipments, while the remaining 18% can be attributed to new
    product introductions and slightly higher average selling prices.

Instrument revenue increased by $77.6 million over prior
    year, of which $68.7 million was due to increased sales of
    our sequencing systems, particularly the Genome Analyzer and
    cluster stations.

Service and other revenue includes revenue generated from
    genotyping and sequencing service contracts, extended warranty
    contracts and research revenue. Service and other revenue
    increased $11.3 million over prior year primarily due to
    the completion of several significant Infinium and iSelect
    custom SNP genotyping service contracts and sequencing services
    contracts. This increase in services represented
    $9.9 million of the variance, while the remainder of the
    difference was generated by an increase in extended warranty
    contracts of $2.2 million offset by a decrease in grant
    revenue of $0.8 million. We expect sales from SNP
    genotyping and sequencing services contracts to fluctuate on a
    yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix and number of
    contracts that are completed. The timing of completion of SNP
    genotyping and sequencing services contracts are highly
    dependent on the customers’ schedules for delivering the
    SNPs and samples to us.

    of acquired intangibles for the year ended December 31,
    2006. The amount amortized in 2007 represents the amortization
    of our intangible assets acquired from Solexa in January 2007.

During the year ended December 30, 2007, we recorded
    $303.4 million of acquired IPR&D resulting from the
    Solexa acquisition. At the acquisition date, Solexa’s
    ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily
    involved with the development of its genetic analysis platform
    for sequencing and expression profiling. These in-process
    research and development projects are comprised of Solexa’s
    reversible terminating nucleotide biochemistry platform,
    referred to as

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry, as well as Solexa’s reagent, analyzer
    and sequencing services related technologies, which were valued
    at $237.2 million, $44.2 million, $19.1 million
    and $2.9 million, respectively, at the acquisition date.
    Although these projects were approximately 95% complete at the
    acquisition date, they had not reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the amounts
    allocated to those projects were written off in the first
    quarter of 2007, the period the acquisition was consummated.
    Acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies by us in
    the future may result in substantial charges for acquired
    IPR&D that may cause fluctuations in our interim or annual
    operating results. There were no charges resulting from any
    acquisitions during the same period in fiscal 2006.

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments

    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
    The increase in interest income over the prior year was
    primarily driven by higher cash balances from the proceeds of
    our February 2007 convertible debt offering, cash acquired as
    part of the Solexa acquisition, and improved operating cash
    flow. In addition, we experienced higher effective interest
    rates on our cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Interest and other expense, net, consists of interest expense

    December 30, 2007, compared to $0.6 million for the

Interest expense was $3.6 million for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, compared to an immaterial amount for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily
    related to our convertible debt offering in February 2007. For
    the years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31,
    2006, we recorded $0.5 million and $0.4 million,
    respectively, in net foreign currency transaction losses,
    respectively. In 2007, these foreign currency exchange losses
    were offset by $0.5 million of foreign currency exchange
    gains associated with the sale of our secured convertible
    debentures with Genizon BioSciences, Inc. in the fourth quarter
    of 2007.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes was
    ($10.4) million and $2.7 million for the years ended
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
    The provision consists of federal, state, and foreign income tax
    expense offset in 2007 by the release of the valuation allowance
    against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax
    assets.

During the year ended December 30, 2007, we utilized
    $72.9 million and $10.8 million of our federal and
    state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, to reduce
    our federal and state income taxes. As of December 30,
    2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and
    state tax purposes of $28.7 million and $99.1 million,
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2015,
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also
    had U.S. federal and state research and development tax
    credit



carryforwards of $9.2 million and $9.3 million
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019
    respectively, unless previously utilized.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant
    future changes in our ownership structure. These annual
    limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses
    and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to
    Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax
    assets as of December 30, 2007.

As of December 30, 2007, we concluded that it is more
    likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax
    assets will be realized and, accordingly we released a portion
    of our valuation allowance, $17.1 million of which was
    recorded as a reduction to the tax provision. In addition, we
    established current and long term deferred tax assets on the
    consolidated balance sheets of $26.8 million and
    $80.1 million, respectively, and decreased the goodwill
    balances recorded in conjunction with the CyVera and Solexa
    acquisitions by $2.1 million and $18.4 million,
    respectively. Based upon the available evidence as of
    December 30, 2007, we are not able to conclude it is more
    likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax
    assets will be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation
    allowance of $2.9 million and $25.4 million against
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.

Historically, our sources of cash have included:

•

issuance of equity and debt securities, including cash generated
    from the issuance of our convertible notes in February 2007, our
    public offering of common stock in August 2008 and the exercise
    of stock options and participation in our Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan (ESPP);

•

cash generated from operations; and

•

interest income.

Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with:

•

cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and
    growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and
    research and development infrastructure and other working
    capital needs;

•

cash paid for litigation settlements;

•

cash used for our stock repurchases;

•

expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity
    and improving our manufacturing efficiency;

•

cash paid for acquisitions; and

•

interest payments on our debt obligations.



Other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include:

•

significant increases in our product and services revenue. As
    our product sales have increased significantly since 2001,
    operating income has increased significantly as well, providing
    us with an increased source of cash to finance the expansion of
    our operations; and

•

fluctuations in our working capital.

We currently invest our funds in treasury notes, commercial
    paper, auction rate securities, corporate bonds and
    U.S. dollar-based short maturity mutual funds. We do not
    hold securities backed by mortgages.

As of December 28, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and
    investments of $696.0 million compared to
    $386.1 million as of December 30, 2007. Included in
    the investment balance as of December 28, 2008 were auction
    rate securities of $55.9 million issued primarily by
    municipalities and universities. The markets for auction rate
    securities effectively ceased when the vast majority of auctions
    failed in February 2008, preventing investors from selling their
    auction rate securities. As of December 28, 2008, the
    securities continued to fail auction and remained illiquid. As a
    result, we have recorded an unrealized loss of $8.7 million
    for the year ended December 28, 2008, resulting in a
    reduction to the fair value of our auction rate securities to
    $47.2 million as of December 28, 2008. This value was
    determined in accordance with SFAS No. 157. We used
    Level 3 hierarchical inputs, due to the lack of actively
    traded market data, including management’s assumptions of
    pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk. We
    based our fair value determination on estimated discounted
    future cash flows of interest income over a projected period
    reflective of the length of time we anticipate it will take the
    securities to become liquid. Additionally, we classified these
    securities as long-term investments as of December 28, 2008
    as we believe we may not be able to liquidate our investments
    within the next year. As of December 30, 2007, these
    securities were classified as short-term as the failures of
    these auctions did not occur until February 2008.

In November 2008, we signed a settlement agreement allowing us
    to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS at our
    discretion during the period of June 30, 2010 through
    July 2, 2012. To account for this settlement agreement, we
    recorded a put option of $8.7 million and recognized a
    corresponding gain in earnings during the fourth quarter of
    2008. The fair value of the put option was determined using a
    discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest
    rates, timing and amount of cash flow, with consideration given
    to UBS’s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate
    securities beginning June 30, 2010. The fair value of the
    put option approximates the difference between the par value and
    fair value of the auction rate securities. The auction rate
    securities were previously classified as

available-for-sale,

and unrealized gains and losses were recognized in other
    comprehensive income. By signing the settlement agreement, we no
    longer have the intent of holding the auction rate securities
    until recovery as we will now recover any unrealized loss
    through the settlement agreement. Accordingly, we elected a
    one-time transfer of the auction rate securities from

available-for-sale

to trading and reclassified previously recorded unrealized
    losses from other comprehensive income to earnings. We will
    continue to recognize gains and losses in earnings approximately
    equal to changes in the fair value of the auction rate
    securities at each balance sheet date. These gains and losses
    will likely be offset by changes in the fair value of the put
    option as we elect the fair value option subject to our
    assessment of the counterparties ability to perform. See
    Part I Item 1A: “Risk Factors —
    Negative conditions in the global credit markets may impair the
    liquidity of a portion of our investment portfolio.”

The primary inflow of cash during the year ended
    December 28, 2008 was from the sale of
    8,050,000 shares of our common stock to the public in
    August 2008 at a public offering price of $43.75 per share,
    raising net proceeds to us of $342.6 million, after
    deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering
    expenses. Additional cash inflows during this year resulted from
    the sale and maturity of our investments in

available-for-sale

securities of $411.8 million and $44.3 million from
    the exercise of our stock options.

The primary cash outflows during the year ended
    December 28, 2008 were attributable to the purchase of

available-for-sale

securities for $568.7 million, the one-time payment of
    $90.0 million made to Affymetrix in accordance with the
    settlement agreement, the repurchase of an aggregate of
    3.1 million shares of our



common stock for $70.8 million and $59.7 million in
    capital expenditures primarily for

construction-in-progress

associated with the expansion of our San Diego facilities,
    additions to manufacturing equipment as well as the development
    of our manufacturing facility in Singapore. Additionally, on
    August 1, 2008, we completed our acquisition of Avantome,
    Inc. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid
    $25.8 million in cash, including transaction costs, and may
    pay up to an additional $35.0 million in contingent cash
    consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones.

Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to
    change, include expenditures related to:

•

our facilities expansion needs, including costs of leasing
    additional facilities;

•

the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in
    our current and future manufacturing and research and
    development facilities;

•

support of our commercialization efforts related to our current
    and future products, including expansion of our direct sales
    force and field support resources both in the United States and
    abroad;

•

potential strategic acquisitions and investments;

•

the continued advancement of research and development
    efforts; and

•

improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency.

We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating
    income, as well as the status of each of our new product
    development programs, will significantly impact our cash
    management decisions.

Our outstanding convertible notes became convertible into cash
    and, if applicable, shares of our common stock as of
    April 1, 2008. The notes continued to be convertible
    through December 31, 2008. Subsequent to year end, on
    December 29, 2008, a noteholder converted notes in an
    aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. Generally,
    upon conversion of a note, we must pay the conversion value of
    the note in cash, up to the principal amount of the note. Any
    excess of the conversion value over the principal amount is
    payable in shares of our common stock. To reduce the potential
    equity dilution upon conversion of the notes, we entered into a
    hedge transaction. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the
    Convertible Senior Notes. Beginning January 1, 2009 the
    notes ceased to be convertible since the trigger for
    convertibility was not met during the last calendar quarter of
    2008. Fluctuations in our stock price could cause the conversion
    feature to trigger in future quarters, resulting in an impact on
    our working capital.

We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and
    income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating
    needs for at least the next twelve months, barring unforeseen
    circumstances. Operating needs include the planned costs to
    operate our business, including amounts required to fund working
    capital and capital expenditures. At the present time, we have
    no material commitments for capital expenditures other than
    development of our additional facility in Little Chesterford,
    United Kingdom. The development of this facility is estimated to
    cost $14.5 million during 2009 although actual costs may
    vary significantly from our current estimate. Our future capital
    requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend
    on many factors, including:

•

our ability to successfully evolve our sequencing and Veracode
    technologies and to expand our sequencing and SNP genotyping
    product lines;

•

scientific progress in our research and development programs and
    the magnitude of those programs;

•

competing technological and market developments; and

•

the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or
    acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement
    our product and service offerings.

As a result of the factors listed above, we may require
    additional funding in the future. Our failure to raise capital
    on acceptable terms, when needed, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
    finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have
    been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
    sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
    purposes. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008,
    we were not involved in any “off balance sheet
    arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

Contractual

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market
    value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by
    fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating
    rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest
    rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our
    invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk
    and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in
    investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a
    relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio,
    and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move
    in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve
    would not



materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive
    financial instruments. For example, if a 100 basis point
    change in overall interest rates were to occur in 2009, our
    interest income would change by approximately $6.4 million
    in relation to amounts we would expect to earn, based on our
    cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of
    December 28, 2008.

Market
    Price Sensitive Instruments

In order to potentially reduce equity dilution, we entered into
    convertible note hedge transactions, entitling us to purchase up
    to 18,322,320 shares of our common stock at a strike price
    of $21.83 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, we sold
    to the counterparties warrants exercisable on a net-share basis,
    for up to 18,322,320 shares of our common stock at a strike
    price of $31.435 per share, subject to adjustment. The
    anti-dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions, if any,
    could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading
    price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the
    warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants, which occur
    during 2014, assuming the warrants are exercised.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

We have operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific. As
    a result, our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. The functional currency for each of our
    subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we remeasure
    the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries
    to the U.S. dollar at month-end exchange rates and
    remeasure the nonmonetary assets and liabilities to the
    U.S. dollar at historical rates. Income and expense amounts
    related to monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the
    U.S. dollar at the weighted average exchange rates in
    effect during the relevant period, and income and expense
    accounts related to nonmonetary assets and liabilities are
    remeasured to the U.S. dollar at historical exchange rates.
    Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized as income, or
    expense, in the period of occurrence.

In addition, many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of
    their business in currencies other than the entity’s
    U.S. functional currency. These transactions give rise to
    receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies
    other than the entity’s functional currency. The value of
    these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange
    rates because they may become worth more or less than they were
    worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes
    in exchange rates. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses
    on the value of these receivables and payables are included in
    the determination of net income. The net currency exchange gain
    recognized on business transactions was $1.9 million for
    the year ended December 28, 2008 and is included in other
    income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Controls
    and Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
    (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
    improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
    recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal
    controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable
    laws and our established financial policies.

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and



operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of December 28, 2008. Based
    upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer concluded that, as of
    December 28, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective to ensure that (a) the information required
    to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
    under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or
    persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our
    management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
    matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
    reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
    objectives, and our management have concluded that the
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
    company have been detected.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with
    the participation of our management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in
    our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 and that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation did
    not identify any such change.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 28, 2008. The
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 28, 2008 has been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 28, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Illumina,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 28, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 28, 2008 of Illumina,
    Inc. and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Illumina, Inc. as of December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 28,
    2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial
    statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Illumina, Inc., at December 28, 2008
    and December 30, 2007, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 28, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 28, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

1.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
    and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on April 28,
    1998. The Company is a leading developer, manufacturer and
    marketer of integrated systems for the large-scale analysis of
    genetic variation and biological function. Using the
    Company’s proprietary technologies, the Company provides a
    comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve
    the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. The
    Company also expects to enter the market for molecular
    diagnostics. The Company’s customers include leading
    genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic
    institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology
    companies. The Company’s tools provide researchers around
    the world with the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness
    and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic
    tests needed to extract valuable medical information from
    advances in genomics and proteomics. The Company believes this
    information will enable researchers to correlate genetic
    variation and biological function, which will enhance drug
    discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected
    earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual
    patients.

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
    Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
    14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
    June 30, and September 30. The years ended
    December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006 were all 52 weeks.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly liquid
    investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the
    date of purchase.

Short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury and
    U.S. government agency securities, municipal notes,
    corporate notes and bonds and commercial paper. All short-term
    investments have been designated as available-for-sale
    securities recorded at estimated fair value with the related
    unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity.
    The Company accounts for investments in debt and equity
    instruments in accordance with SFAS, No. 115,

Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

and
    FASB Staff Position, or FSP,

No. 115-1,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

, or

FSP 115-1.

Management determines the appropriate classification of such
    securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
    classification as of each balance sheet date. The Company
    follows the guidance provided by

FSP 115-1,

to assess whether investments with unrealized loss positions are
    other than temporarily impaired. Realized gains and losses and
    declines in value judged to be other than temporary are
    determined based on the specific identification method and are
    reported in Interest and other expense, net in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

F-7


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Long-term investments are comprised of the Company’s
    auction rate securities and a put option related to the
    Company’s settlement agreement with UBS that gives the
    Company the right to sell its auction rate securities to UBS at
    par value at a future date. Both the auction rate securities and
    the put option are recorded at estimated fair value and
    unrealized gains and losses, if any, are recognized in Interest
    income on the consolidated statements of operations.
    Historically, the Company’s auction rate securities were
    classified as available-for-sale securities, however, during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reclassified the
    auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading
    securities. See Note 4 for further detailed discussion.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash
    equivalents, foreign cash accounts, accounts receivable, prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued
    expenses and other current liabilities approximate the related
    fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
    instruments. The estimated fair value of the convertible senior
    notes is determined by using available market information as of
    the latest trading date prior to the Company’s fiscal
    year-end provided by a third party financial institution. The
    fair value of the Company’s convertible notes at
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 are
    $473.0 million and $596.3 million, respectively.

Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net invoice value
    and are not interest bearing. The Company considers receivables
    past due based on the contractual payment terms. The Company
    reviews its exposure to amounts receivable and reserves specific
    amounts if collectibility is no longer reasonably assured. The
    Company also reserves a percentage of its trade receivable
    balance based on collection history and current economic trends
    that might impact the level of future credit losses. The Company
    re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and adjusts its
    reserves as needed.

Concentrations
    of Risk

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and
    rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting
    customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or
    services with new capabilities and other factors could
    negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

The Company is also subject to risks related to its financial
    instruments including its cash and cash equivalents, investments
    and accounts receivable. Most of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents as of December 28, 2008 were deposited
    with financial institutions in the United States and the
    Company’s investment policy restricts the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer to 5% of the portfolio at the time of
    purchase and to any one industry sector, as defined by Bloomberg
    classifications, to 25% of the portfolio at the time of
    purchase. There is no limit to the percentage of the portfolio
    that may be maintained in securities issued by the U.S
    government and money market funds. The Company has historically
    not experienced significant credit losses from investments and
    accounts receivable. The Company performs a regular review of
    customer activity and associated credit risks.

The Company’s products require customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
    Company obtains certain key components included in its products
    from single vendors.

Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 51%,
    43% and 44% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended
    December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. Customers outside the
    United States represented 61% and 46% of the Company’s net
    accounts receivable balance as of December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, respectively. Sales to territories
    outside of the United States are generally denominated in
    U.S. dollars. International sales entail a variety of
    risks, including

F-8


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment cycles and
    greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection. The
    Company is also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as
    political, social and economic instability and changes in
    diplomatic and trade relations. The risks of international sales
    are mitigated in part by the extent to which sales are
    geographically distributed.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in,
    first out basis) or market. Inventory includes raw materials and
    finished goods that may be used in the research and development
    process and such items are expensed as consumed or expired.
    Provisions for slow moving, excess and obsolete inventories are
    provided based on product life cycle and development plans,
    product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and
    inventory levels.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
    impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets (generally three to seven years) using the
    straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
    computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
    useful life of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are
    charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold, or
    otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
    depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
    is included in operating expense.

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net
    assets acquired. Intangible assets include acquired technology,
    customer relationships, other license agreements and licensed
    technology (capitalized as part of the Affymetrix litigation).
    The cost of identified intangible assets is amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years
    unless the expected benefit pattern is declining, in which case
    an accelerated method is used.

The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if the
    carrying values of the long-lived assets are impaired. In
    accordance with SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,

goodwill and other intangible assets that have
    indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment at least
    annually during the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently if
    an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The
    Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of
    May 30, 2008, utilizing a test that begins with an estimate
    of the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset,
    noting no impairment and has determined there has been no
    impairment indicators for goodwill through December 28,
    2008. A review of intangible assets that have finite useful
    lives and other long-lived assets is performed when an event
    occurs indicating the potential for impairment in accordance
    with SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
    of Long-Lived Assets

. If indicators of impairment exist, the
    Company assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived
    assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets
    can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash
    flows. If impairment is indicated, the Company measures the
    future discounted cash flows associated with the use of the
    asset and adjusts the value of the asset accordingly. Factors
    that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a
    significant decline in the Company’s stock price and market
    capitalization compared to its net book value, significant
    changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate
    positive cash flows and significant changes in the
    Company’s strategic business objectives and utilization of
    the asset.

Reserve
    for Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    instrumentation. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company
    establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses
    associated with system sales. This expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of revenue.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale
    of products and services. Product revenue consists of sales of
    arrays, reagents, flow cells, instrumentation, oligonucleotides
    (oligos) and associated freight charges. Service and other
    revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping
    and sequencing services, extended warranty sales and amounts
    earned under research agreements with government grants, which
    are recognized in the period during which the related costs are
    incurred.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In
    instances where final acceptance of the product or system is
    required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria
    have been met. All revenue is recorded net of any applicable
    allowances for returns or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    Revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized
    when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping or
    sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    the Company ensures there are no refund rights. If payment terms
    are based on future performance, the Company defers revenue
    recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable. The
    Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors,
    including past transaction history with the customer and the
    creditworthiness of the customer. If the Company determines that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. The Company also sells separately priced maintenance
    (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or
    two years, upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue
    for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term
    of the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If the Company were to experience an
    increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its
    warrantied products were greater than its estimates, gross
    margins could be adversely affected.

While the majority of its sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, the Company does enter into agreements
    that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and
    conditions. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    For arrangements with multiple elements, revenue recognition is
    based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist
    in the arrangement. A delivered item is considered a separate
    unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the
    customer on a stand-alone basis and there is objective and
    reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
    Items are considered to have stand-alone value when they are
    sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell
    the item on a stand-alone basis. The fair value of an item is
    generally the price charged for the product, if the item is
    regularly sold on a stand-alone basis. When objective and
    reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of
    accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is
    generally allocated to each unit

F-10


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of accounting based upon its relative fair value. In those
    instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value
    exists for the undelivered items but not for the delivered
    items, the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement
    consideration. Under the residual method, the amount of
    arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items
    equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
    fair value of the undelivered items. When the Company is unable
    to establish stand-alone value for delivered items or when fair
    value of undelivered items has not been established, revenue is
    deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been
    performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
    any remaining undelivered elements. The Company recognizes
    revenue for delivered elements only when it determines that the
    fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no
    uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

Shipping
    and Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
    revenue and totaled $3.7 million, $2.2 million and
    $1.8 million for the years ended December 28, 2008,
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
    internal and grant-sponsored research and development. Research
    and development expenses include salaries, contractor fees,
    facilities costs, utilities and allocations of benefits.
    Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed
    in the period incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as
    incurred.

Advertising costs were
    $3.4 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million for
    the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis, and includes a review of all available positive and
    negative evidence. Factors reviewed include projections of
    pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, determination
    of cumulative pre-tax book income after permanent differences,
    history of earnings, and reliability of forecasting. As of
    December 28, 2008, the Company maintained a valuation
    allowance only against certain U.S. and foreign deferred
    tax assets that the Company concluded did not meet the
    “more likely than not” threshold required under
    SFAS No. 109.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.
    When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
    Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of
    the impact of a tax position in the Company’s financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income
    tax expense.

Functional
    Currency

Historically, the Company identified the local currency as the
    functional currency in each of its foreign subsidiaries, and the
    effects of translation were recorded as other comprehensive
    income (loss). During the third quarter of 2008, the Company
    reorganized its international structure to execute a more
    efficient relationship between product development, product
    manufacturing and sales. The reorganization increased the
    foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the
    U.S. entity for management decisions, financial support,
    production assets and inventory, thereby making the foreign
    subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the
    U.S. entity’s operations. As a result, the Company
    reassessed the primary economic environment of its foreign
    subsidiaries and determined the subsidiaries are more
    U.S. dollar based, resulting in a U.S. dollar
    functional currency determination. As a result of this change,
    beginning in the third quarter of 2008, the Company remeasures
    its foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities and income
    and expense accounts related to nonmonetary assets and
    liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the net gains or
    losses resulting from remeasurement in its consolidated
    statements of operations within interest and other expense, net.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation using the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based
    Payment

using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock
    purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). This
    model incorporates various assumptions including volatility,
    expected life, and interest rates. Historically, the Company
    used an expected stock-price volatility assumption that was
    primarily based on historical realized volatility of the
    underlying stock during a period of time. Beginning the third
    quarter of 2007, volatility was determined by equally weighing
    the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s
    common stock. The historical volatility of the Company’s
    common stock over the most recent period is generally
    commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
    Company’s stock options, adjusted for the impact of unusual
    fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant
    factors. The implied volatility is calculated from the implied
    market volatility of exchange-traded call options on the
    Company’s common stock. The expected life of an award is
    based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions
    of the stock awards granted to employees.

Adopted
    Accounting Pronouncements

During fiscal 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157,
    “

Fair Value Measurements

”. In February 2008,
    the FASB issued Staff Position

No. FSP 157-2,

“

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

”

(FSP 157-2),

which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least
    annually. Therefore, the Company has adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 with respect to its financial assets and
    liabilities only. The adoption of this statement did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of
    operations or financial condition. On October 10, 2008, the
    FASB issued FSP

No. 157-3,

“

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When
    the Market for That Asset is Not Active

”

(FSP 157-3)

that clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a
    market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate
    key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
    asset when the market for that financial assets is not active.

FSP 157-3

is effective for all periods presented in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157. The Company considered the additional
    guidance with respect to the valuation of its financial assets
    and liabilities and their corresponding designation within the
    fair value hierarchy. All short-term investments were valued
    using quoted prices in active markets or Level 1
    hierarchical inputs. Long-term investments were valued using
    Level 3 hierarchical inputs due to the lack of trading in
    the secondary market of these instruments. Refer to Notes 3
    and 4.

During fiscal 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 159
    “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities

”. SFAS No. 159 allows
    an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the
    initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial
    assets and liabilities on a

contract-by-contract

basis. The objective of the guidance is to improve financial
    reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate
    volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related
    assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
    complex hedge accounting provisions. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 impacted the accounting for the put
    option recorded as a result of the signed settlement agreement
    with UBS AG (UBS) in November 2008. Refer to Note 4.

    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    and sets forth what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. The guidance will become
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the

    expected life of the debt. These amounts represent
    management’s best estimates of the effects the adoption of

Acquisitions

Avantome,

On August 1, 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of
    Avantome, Inc. (Avantome), a privately-held Delaware
    corporation. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company
    paid $25.8 million in cash, including transaction costs,
    and may pay up to an additional $35.0 million in contingent
    cash consideration based on the achievement of certain
    milestones. The Company assumed $1.1 million in net assets,
    and recorded a charge of $24.7 million for purchased
    in-process research and development (IPR&D) primarily
    associated with the development of Avantome’s low-cost,
    long read-length sequencing technology. The amount

allocated to IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition as it was
    determined that the underlying project had not reached
    technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The
    Company has assessed the contingent consideration payable in
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141,

, and

EITF 95-8,

Accounting for Contingent Consideration Paid to the
    Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise in a Purchase Business

Contingent consideration of $11.0 million
    will be recorded as compensation expense over a three-year
    period as this consideration is earned by the former primary
    shareholders of Avantome contingent upon their employment with
    the Company for three years. The remaining contingent
    consideration of $24.0 million will be recorded as
    additional purchase price if and when certain milestones are
    achieved or the amount due is determinable beyond a reasonable
    doubt.

The results of Avantome’s operations have been included in
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the

    of Solexa, a Delaware corporation, in a stock-for-stock merger
    transaction. The Company issued 26.2 million shares of its
    common stock as consideration for this merger.

The purchase price of the acquisition is as follows (in
    thousands):

Based on the estimated fair values at the acquisition date, the
    Company allocated $303.4 million to IPR&D,
    $62.2 million to tangible assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed and $24.4 million to intangible assets. The
    remaining excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
    net assets acquired of $228.7 million was allocated to
    goodwill.

The results of Solexa’s operations have been included in
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the
    acquisition date of January 26, 2007. The following

Long-term
    Investments

The Company has $55.9 million (at cost) in auction rate
    securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities.
    The auction rate securities are held in a brokerage account with
    UBS. These securities are debt instruments with a long-term
    maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short
    intervals through auctions. The Company’s entire auction
    rate portfolio is currently rated AAA or AA by a rating agency.

The markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when
    the vast majority of auctions failed in February 2008,
    preventing investors from selling their auction rate securities.
    As of December 28, 2008, the securities continued to fail
    auction and remained illiquid. As a result, the Company recorded
    an unrealized loss of $8.7 million for the year ended
    December 28, 2008, resulting in a reduction to the fair
    value of the

F-19


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company’s auction rate securities to $47.2 million.
    This unrealized loss was determined in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

.

As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in
    fair value measurements, SFAS No. 157 establishes a
    fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
    techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels
    including the following:

•

Level 1

— Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2

— Inputs other than Level 1
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
    in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3

— Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to
    Level 1 and the lowest priority to Level 3. In
    determining the fair value of the Company’s auction rate
    securities, the Company considered trades in the secondary
    market. However, due to the recent auction failures of the
    auction rate securities in the marketplace and the lack of
    trading in the secondary market of these instruments, there was
    insufficient observable auction rate security market information
    available to directly determine the fair value of the
    Company’s investments. As a result, the value of these
    auction rate securities and resulting unrealized loss was
    determined using Level 3 hierarchical inputs. These inputs
    include management’s assumptions of pricing by market
    participants, including assumptions about risk. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 157, the Company used the concepts of
    fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows of
    interest income over a projected five year period reflective of
    the length of time until the Company’s securities are
    expected to become liquid or potentially get repurchased. In
    preparing this model, the Company used historical data of the
    rates upon which a majority of the auction rate securities’
    contractual rates were based, such as the LIBOR and average
    trailing twelve-month

90-day

Treasury interest rate spreads, to estimate future interest
    rates. The Company also considered the discount factors, taking
    into account the credit ratings of the auction rate securities,
    using a discount rate of 5%. The Company obtained information
    from multiple sources, including UBS, to determine a reasonable
    range of assumptions to use in valuing the auction rate
    securities. The Company’s model was corroborated by a
    separate comparable cash flow analysis prepared by UBS. To
    understand the sensitivity of the Company’s valuation, the
    liquidity factor and estimated remaining life was varied.
    Variations in those results were evaluated and it was determined
    the factors and valuation method chosen were reasonable and
    representative of the Company’s auction rate security
    portfolio.

The Company classified these securities as long-term assets
    since the Company believes it may not be able to liquidate its
    investments without significant loss within the next year. As of
    December 30, 2007, these securities were classified as
    short-term since the failures of these auctions did not occur
    until February 2008.

As a result of the auction rate failures, various regulatory
    agencies initiated investigations into the sales and marketing
    practices of several banks and broker-dealers, including UBS,
    which sold auction rate securities, alleging violations of
    federal and state laws. Along with several other broker-dealers,
    UBS subsequently reached a settlement with the federal and state
    regulators that required them to repurchase auction rate
    securities from certain investors at par at some future date. In
    November 2008 the Company signed a settlement agreement to sell
    its auction rate securities at par value to UBS during the
    period of June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012 (the
    Settlement). In accepting the Settlement, the Company released
    UBS from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of
    auction rate securities. Although the Company expects to sell
    its auction rates securities under the Settlement, if the
    Settlement is not exercised before July 2, 2012, it will
    expire and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy
    the Company’s auction rate securities. In lieu of the
    acceptance of the Settlement, the auction rate securities will
    continue to accrue interest as

F-20


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the
    prospectus of the auction rate securities if the auction process
    fails. In addition to offering to repurchase the Company’s
    auction rate securities, as part of the Settlement, UBS has
    agreed to provide the Company with a “no net cost”
    loan up to 75% of the par value of the auction rate securities
    until June 30, 2010. Per the terms of the Settlement, the
    interest rate on the loan will approximate the weighted average
    interest or dividend rate payable to the Company by the issuer
    of any auction rate securities pledged as collateral.

UBS’s obligations under the Settlement are not secured by
    its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to
    support its performance obligations under the Settlement. UBS
    has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient
    financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the
    Settlement.

To account for the Settlement, the Company recorded a separate
    freestanding asset (put option) of $8.7 million and
    recognized a corresponding gain in earnings during the fourth
    quarter of 2008. The fair value of the put option is included in
    long-term investments on the balance sheet as of
    December 28, 2008 with the corresponding gain classified as
    interest income in the consolidated statement of operations for
    the year ended December 28, 2008. The put option does not
    meet the definition of a derivative instrument under
    SFAS No. 133, therefore, the Company elected to
    measure the put option at fair value under
    SFAS No. 159. The Company valued the put option using
    a discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest
    rates, timing and amount of cash flow, with consideration given
    to UBS’s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate
    securities beginning June 30, 2010. These assumptions are
    volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of
    these assumptions and market conditions change.

Prior to accepting the UBS offer, the Company recorded its
    auction rate securities as available-for-sale investments, and
    therefore recorded resulting unrealized gains or losses in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in its statements of
    stockholders’ equity. By signing the settlement agreement,
    the Company no longer had the intent of holding the auction rate
    securities until recovery as management now has the intent to
    exercise its put option during the period June 30, 2010 to
    July 3, 2012. As a result, the Company elected a one-time
    transfer of the auction rate securities from available-for-sale
    to trading in accordance with SFAS No. 115. Prior to
    its agreement with UBS, management’s intent was to hold the
    auction rate securities until the earlier of anticipated
    recovery in market value or maturity. Upon transfer to trading
    securities, the Company immediately recognized a loss of
    $8.7 million, included in interest income for the amount of
    the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings. The
    Company will continue to recognize gains and losses in earnings
    approximating the changes in the fair value of the auction rate
    securities at each balance sheet date. These gains and losses
    are expected to be approximately offset by changes in the fair
    value of the put option.

Intangible
    Assets

The Company’s intangible assets are comprised primarily of
    acquired core technology and customer relationships from the
    acquisition of Solexa and licensed technology from the
    Affymetrix settlement entered into on January 9, 2008. As a
    result of this settlement, the Company agreed, without admitting
    liability, to make a one-time payment to Affymetrix of
    $90.0 million. In return, Affymetrix agreed to dismiss with
    prejudice all lawsuits it had brought against the Company, and
    the Company agreed to dismiss with prejudice its counterclaims
    in the relevant lawsuits. Affymetrix also agreed not to sue the
    Company or its affiliates or customers for making, using or
    selling any of the Company’s current products, evolutions
    of those products or services related to those products. In
    addition, Affymetrix agreed that, for four years, it will not
    sue the Company for making, using or selling the Company’s
    products or services that are based on future technology
    developments. The covenant not to sue covers all fields other
    than photolithography, the process by which Affymetrix
    manufactures its arrays and a field in which the Company does
    not operate.

Of the total $90.0 million payment made on January 25,
    2008, $36.0 million was recorded as licensed technology and
    classified as an intangible asset. The remaining
    $54.0 million was charged to expense during

    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies

, and

EITF 00-21

using the concepts of fair value based on the past and estimated
    future revenue streams related to the products covered by the
    patents previously under dispute. The value of the licensed
    technology is the benefit derived, calculated using estimated
    discounted cash flows and future revenue projections, from the
    perpetual covenant not to sue for damages related to the sale of
    the Company’s current products. The Company utilized an
    annual discount rate of 9.25% when preparing this model. The
    effective life of the licensed technology extends through 2015,
    the final expiry date of all patents considered in valuing the
    intangible asset. The related amortization is based on the
    higher of the percentage of usage or the straight-line method.
    The percentage of usage was determined using actual and
    projected revenues generated from products covered by the
    patents previously under dispute.

Acquired core technology and customer relationships are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their effective useful
    lives of ten and three years, respectively. The amortization of
    the Company’s intangible assets is excluded from cost of
    product revenue and is separately classified as amortization of
    intangible assets on the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations.

Impairment
    of Manufacturing Equipment

During fiscal 2008, the Company implemented next-generation
    imaging and decoding systems to be used in manufacturing. These
    systems were developed to increase existing capacity and allow
    the Company to transition to the Infinium High-Density (HD)
    product line. As a result of this transition, the demand for
    products manufactured on the previous infrastructure was reduced
    and certain systems were no longer being

utilized. In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

, a non-cash impairment charge of $4.1 million
    was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 for the excess
    machinery. This charge is included as a separate line item in
    the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. There
    was no change to useful lives and related depreciation expense
    of the remaining assets as the Company believes these estimates
    are currently reflective of the period the assets will be used
    in operations.

Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    sequencing, genotyping and gene expression systems. At the time
    revenue is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for
    estimated warranty expenses associated with system sales. This
    expense is recorded as a component of cost of product revenue.
    Estimated warranty expenses associated with extended maintenance
    contracts are recorded as cost of revenue ratably over the term
    of the maintenance contract.

Changes in the Company’s reserve for product warranties

Convertible
    Senior Notes

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued
    $400.0 million principal amount of 0.625% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2014 (the Notes), which included the exercise
    of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an
    additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    Notes. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the
    initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses, were
    $390.3 million. The Company will pay 0.625% interest per
    annum on the principal amount of the Notes, payable
    semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of
    each year. The Company made interest payments of
    $1.3 million and $1.2 million on February 15,
    2008 and August 15, 2008, respectively. The Notes mature on
    February 15, 2014.

The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable,
    shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value
    per share, based on a conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of
    45.8058 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which
    represents a conversion price of $21.83 per share), only in the
    following circumstances and to the following extent:
    (1) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive trading period (the
    measurement period) in which the trading price per Note for each
    day of such measurement period was less than 97% of the product
    of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common
    stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during
    any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending
    March 30, 2007, if the last reported sale price of the
    Company’s common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately

F-23


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable
    conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the
    immediately preceding calendar quarter; (3) upon the
    occurrence of specified events; and (4) the Notes will be
    convertible at any time on or after November 15, 2013
    through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    the maturity date. The requirements of the second condition
    above were satisfied during the first, second and third quarters
    of 2008. Accordingly, the Company’s outstanding convertible
    notes became convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of
    common stock, during the period from, and including
    April 1, 2008 through, and including, December 31,
    2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the requirements of
    this same condition were no longer satisfied, accordingly, the
    Notes will no longer be convertible during the period from, and
    including January 1, 2009 through, and including
    March 31, 2009 unless another conversion condition is
    satisfied during this period. Generally, upon conversion of a
    Note, the Company will pay the conversion value of the Note in
    cash, up to the principal amount of the Note. Any excess of the
    conversion value over the principal amount is payable in shares
    of the Company’s common stock. As of December 28,
    2008, the principal amount of these Notes was classified as
    current liabilities as the Notes were still convertible through
    December 31, 2008.

In connection with the offering of the Notes in February 2007,
    the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions
    (the hedge) with the initial purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the counterparties) entitling the Company to
    purchase up to 18,322,320 shares of the Company’s
    common stock at a strike price of $21.83 per share, subject to
    adjustment. In addition, the Company sold to these
    counterparties warrants (the warrants) exercisable, on a
    cashless basis, for up to 18,322,320 shares of the
    Company’s common stock at a strike price of $31.435 per
    share, subject to adjustment. The cost of the hedge that was not
    covered by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was
    $46.6 million and was reflected as a reduction of
    additional paid-in capital. The hedge is expected to reduce the
    potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes to the
    extent the Company exercises the note hedges to purchase shares
    from the counterparties to deliver to converting noteholders.
    However, the warrants could have a dilutive effect on the
    Company’s earnings per share to the extent that the price
    of the Company’s common stock exceeds the strike price of
    the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants, which occur
    during 2014, and the warrants are exercised.

    September 10, 2008 and a distribution date of
    September 22, 2008. Share and per share amounts have been
    restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented.

On August 12, 2008, a total of 8,050,000 shares were
    sold to the public at a public offering price of $43.75 per
    share, raising net proceeds to the Company of

Stock
    Options

In June 2005, the stockholders of the Company approved the 2005
    Stock and Incentive Plan (the 2005 Stock Plan). Upon adoption of
    the 2005 Stock Plan, issuance of options under the
    Company’s existing 2000 Stock Plan ceased. Additionally, in
    connection with the acquisition of Solexa, the Company assumed
    stock options granted under the 2005 Solexa Equity Incentive
    Plan (the 2005 Solexa Equity Plan). The 2005 Stock Plan and the
    2005 Solexa Equity Plan initially provided that an aggregate of
    up to 24,571,238 shares of the Company’s common stock
    be reserved and available to be issued. The 2005 Stock Plan
    provides for an automatic annual increase in the shares reserved
    for issuance by the lesser of 5% of the outstanding shares of
    the Company’s common stock on the last day of the
    immediately preceding fiscal year, 2,400,000 shares or such
    lesser amount as determined by the Company’s board of
    directors. Additionally, during the Company’s Annual
    Meeting of Stockholders held on May 16, 2008, the
    stockholders ratified an amendment to increase the maximum
    number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under
    the 2005 Stock Plan by 2,400,000 shares. As of
    December 28, 2008, options to purchase
    6,777,903 shares remained available for future grant under
    the 2005 Stock Plan and 2005 Solexa Equity Plan.

On January 29, 2008, the Company’s board of directors
    approved the New Hire Stock and Incentive Plan, which provides
    for the issuance of options and shares of restricted stock to
    newly hired employees. There is no set number of shares reserved
    for issuance under this Plan.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
    adopted the 2000 ESPP. A total of 15,467,426 shares of the
    Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
    under the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase
    common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions,
    during defined offering periods.

The price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to
    85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or
    last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The initial
    offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition, beginning
    with fiscal 2001, the ESPP provides for annual increases of
    shares available for issuance by the lesser of 3% of the number
    of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the
    last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year,
    3,000,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined by the
    Company’s board of directors. Shares totaling 276,198,
    266,962 and 532,788 were issued under the ESPP during fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 28, 2008,
    there were 10,794,162 shares available for issuance under
    the ESPP.

Restricted
    Stock Units

In 2007 the Company began granting restricted stock units
    pursuant to its 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan as part of its
    periodic employee equity compensation review program. Restricted
    stock units are share awards that, upon vesting, will deliver to
    the holder shares of the Company’s common stock. Restricted
    stock units granted during 2007 vest over four years as follows:
    15% vest on the first and second anniversaries of the grant
    date, 30% vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and
    40% vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Effective
    January 2008, the Company changed the vesting schedule for
    grants of new restricted stock units. Currently, restricted
    stock units vest 15% on the first anniversary of the grant date,
    20% on the second anniversary of the grant date, 30% on the
    third anniversary of the grant date and 35% on the fourth
    anniversary of the grant date.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity
    and related information in the fiscal year ended
    December 28, 2008 is as follows:

The weighted average grant-date fair value per share for the
    restricted stock units was $34.53 and $25.69 for the years ended
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.
    No restricted stock units were outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006.

Based on the closing price per share of the Company’s
    common stock of $25.36 on December 26, 2008, the total
    pretax intrinsic value of all outstanding restricted stock units
    on that date was $40.0 million.

Treasury
    Stock

In connection with its issuance of $400.0 million principal
    amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 on
    February 16, 2007, the Company repurchased
    11.6 million shares of its outstanding common stock for
    $201.6 million in privately negotiated transactions
    concurrently with the offering.

On February 20, 2007, the Company executed a

Rule 10b5-1

trading plan to repurchase up to $75.0 million of its
    outstanding common stock over a period of six months. The
    Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its common stock
    under this plan for $50.0 million. As of December 30,
    2007, this plan had expired.

On October 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a
    $120.0 million stock repurchase program. As of
    December 28, 2008 the Company had repurchased
    3.1 million shares for $70.8 million under the plan in
    open-market transactions or through privately negotiated
    transactions in compliance with

Rule 10b-18

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of
    December 28, 2008, $49.2 million remains authorized
    for future repurchases under the program.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the board of directors of the Company
    declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the
    Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 (the
    Record Date) to the stockholders of record on that date. Each
    Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
    Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of its
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of
    $100 per unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a person or
    group hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
    the outstanding common stock of the Company or announces an
    offer for 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. If a
    person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase, at the exercise price of the right, a number of shares
    of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
    price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or
    other business combination transaction after a person acquires
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each Right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of common shares of the acquiring

company which at the time of such transaction have a market
    value of two times the exercise price of the right. The board of
    directors will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.01 per Right at any time before any such person acquires
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock. The rights expire on May 14, 2011 unless such date
    is extended or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
    the Company.

Litigation
    Settlements

In the recent past, the Company incurred substantial costs in
    defending against patent infringement claims and expects, going
    forward, to devote substantial financial and managerial
    resources to protect the Company’s intellectual property
    and to defend against any future claims asserted against the
    Company. From time to time, the Company may also be parties to
    other litigation in the ordinary course of business. While the
    results of any litigation are uncertain, management does not
    believe the ultimate resolution of its legal matters will result
    in a material adverse impact to the Company.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, Applied Biosystems Inc. (Applied
    Biosystems), formerly known as Applera Corporation (currently
    known as Applied Biosystems LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of
    Life Technologies Corporation), filed suit in California
    Superior Court, Santa Clara County, against Solexa (which
    was acquired by the Company on January 26, 2007). This
    State Court action related to the ownership of several patents
    assigned in 1995 to Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx
    Therapeutics) by a former employee (Dr. Stephen Macevicz),
    who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a
    co-defendant in the suit. The Macevicz patents are directed to
    methods for sequencing DNA (US Pat. Nos. 5,750,341 and
    6,306,597) using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe
    ligation

(sequencing-by-ligation),

and to a probe (5,969,119) used in connection with these
    sequencing methods. Lynx was originally a unit of Applied
    Biosystems but was spun out in 1992. On May 31, 2007,
    Applied Biosystems filed a second suit, this time against the
    Company, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of California. This second suit sought a declaratory
    judgment of non-infringement of the Macevicz patents that were
    the subject of the State Court action mentioned above. Both
    suits were later consolidated in the U.S. District Court
    for the Northern District of California, San Francisco
    Division. By these consolidated actions, Applied Biosystems was
    seeking ownership of the three Macevicz patents, unspecified
    costs and damages, and a declaration of non-infringement and
    invalidity of these patents. Applied Biosystems was not
    asserting any claim for patent infringement against the Company.

On January 5, 2009, the case went to trial in two phases.
    The first phase addressed the determination of ownership of the

patents-in-suit,

and the second phase addressed whether these patents were
    infringed and valid. On January 14, 2009, at the end of the
    first phase, a federal jury determined that Solexa was the
    rightful owner of all three Macevicz patents. On
    January 27, 2009, the same jury found that Applied
    Biosystems did not infringe the ’119 probe patent, and that
    the ’119 patent was valid. In August 2008, the court had
    ruled that Applied Biosystems’ two-base system did not
    infringe the ’341 and ’597 patents. Prior to the jury
    finding of non-infringement of the ’119 patent, Applied
    Biosystems conceded that its one-base system infringed claim 1
    of the ’597 patent and Solexa conceded invalidity of that
    same claim under the court’s construction of that claim.
    Both parties reserved the right to appeal the court’s
    construction of claim 1 of the ’597 patent, among other
    things.

The Company’s Genome Analyzer products use a different
    technology, called

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which is not covered by any of the Macevicz patents. In
    addition, the Company has no plans to use any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by these patents.

    valuation allowance is performed on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis, and includes a review of all available positive and
    negative evidence. Based on the available evidence as of
    December 28, 2008, the Company was not able to conclude it
    is more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred
    tax assets will be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded a
    valuation allowance of $2.8 million and $12.4 million
    against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets,
    respectively. At December 30, 2007, the Company had
    concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant
    portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized and,
    accordingly the Company released a portion of its valuation
    allowance, $17.1 million of which was recorded as a
    reduction to the tax provision.

As of December 28, 2008, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    $87.7 million and $148.3 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2025 and 2013, respectively, unless
    previously utilized. In addition, the Company also had
    U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit
    carryforwards of $12.6 million and $13.9 million,
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019,
    respectively, unless previously utilized.

As of December 28, 2008, the valuation allowance includes
    $14.0 million of pre-acquisition deferred tax assets of
    Solexa. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 141(R) to the extent
    any of these assets were recognized, the adjustment would have
    been applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill related to the
    acquisition, and then an a reduction to the tax provision.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating losses and
    credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any
    significant future changes in its ownership structure. These
    annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating
    losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations
    due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the
    deferred tax assets as of December 28, 2008.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.
    When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company. During 2008, the Company realized $18.5 million of
    such excess tax benefits, and accordingly recorded a
    corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. As of
    December 28, 2008, the Company has $36.5 million of
    unrealized excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation. These tax benefits will be accounted for as a
    credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized,
    rather than a reduction of the tax provision.

The Company’s manufacturing operations in Singapore operate
    under various tax holidays and incentives that begin to expire
    in 2018. For the year ended December 28, 2008, these tax
    holidays and incentives resulted in an approximate
    $1.9 million decrease to the tax provision and an increase
    to net income per diluted share of $0.01.

Residual U.S. income taxes have not been provided on
    $14.7 million of undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries as of December 28, 2008, since the earnings
    are considered to be indefinitely invested in the operations of
    such subsidiaries.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of
    the impact of a tax position in the Company’s financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. The adoption of
    FIN No. 48 did not result in an adjustment to the
    Company’s opening stockholders’ equity since there was
    no cumulative effect from the change in accounting principle.

The following table summarizes the gross amount of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions (in thousands):

Increases related to current year tax positions

Balance at December 28, 2008

As of December 28, 2008, $7.7 million of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions would reduce the
    Company’s annual effective tax rate, if recognized.

The Company does not expect its uncertain tax positions to
    change significantly over the next 12 months. Any interest
    and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be
    reflected in income tax expense. As of December 28, 2008,
    no interest or penalties have been accrued related to the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions. Tax years 1992 to 2008
    remain subject to future examination by the major tax
    jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.

    80% of their base salary and 100% of all other forms of
    compensation into the Plan, including bonus, commission and

    or retirement or a change in control of the Company. The
    benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are
    generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at
    the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of
    their employment with the Company for any reason or at a later
    date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. As of
    December 28, 2008, no employer contributions were made to
    the Plan.

In January 2008, the Company also established a rabbi trust for
    the benefit of its directors and executives under the Plan. In
    accordance with FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
    Interpretation of ARB No. 51

Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where

    Company has included the assets of the rabbi trust in its
    consolidated balance sheet since the trust’s inception. As
    of December 28, 2008, the assets of the trust and
    liabilities of the Company were $1.3 million. The assets
    and liabilities are classified as other assets and accrued
    liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s balance sheet
    as of December 28, 2008. Changes in the values of the
    assets held by the rabbi trust accrue to the Company.
