Overview

We are a leading developer and marketer of next-generation tools
for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.
Understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the
development of personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics.
Our tools provide information that could be used to improve
drugs and therapies, customize diagnoses and treatment, and cure
disease.

The sequencing of the human genome has driven demand for tools
that can assist researchers in processing the billions of tests
necessary to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable
information. This requires functional analysis of highly complex
biological systems, involving a scale of experimentation not
previously practical. Using our technologies, we have developed
a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of
experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required
to help achieve the goals of molecular medicine.



Our patented BeadArray technology uses microscopic beads
randomly deposited in wells to achieve a level of
miniaturization that allows for a new scale of experimentation.
A microarray is a collection of miniaturized test sites arranged
on a surface that permits many tests, or assays, to be performed
in parallel. We assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive
materials. Our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to
easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications,
including both genotyping and gene expression. These
characteristics allow us to create next-generation arrays with a
unique combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness and
flexibility. In addition, our complementary Oligator technology
permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces
of DNA necessary to perform large-scale genetic analysis on
arrays.

We provide both products and services that utilize our
proprietary technologies. During 2001, we launched our
commercial genotyping service product line which combines our
BeadArray technology with an automated, laboratory information
management system, or LIMS, controlled process to provide high
throughput identification of the most common form of genetic
variation, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. We
also began the sale of custom synthesized pieces of DNA called
oligonucleotides, or oligos, using our proprietary Oligator
technology.

In 2002, we announced the launch of our production-scale
BeadLab. This integrated turnkey system is built around our
proprietary BeadArray technology. Included in the system are the
BeadArray Reader, GoldenGate assay protocols, LIMS and
analytical software, fluid-handling robotics, and access to
Sentrix arrays and our reagent kits for analyzing genetic
sequences. Our Sentrix Array Matrix is a collection of
individual arrays arranged in an Array of Arrays pattern
compatible with standard microtiter plates, our reagent kit uses
highly multiplexed GoldenGate assay protocols which allow up to
1536 SNPs to be analyzed at one time in a sample and our
BeadArray Reader is a proprietary scanner used to read the
results of the experiments captured on our arrays. When
installed, the BeadLab is able to routinely produce up to
1.4 million genotypes per day.

Also in 2002, we were named the largest U.S. participant in
the $100 million first phase of the International HapMap
Project funded by the National Institutes of Health. This
project is an internationally funded successor project to the
Human Genome Project that is creating a map of genetic
variations that may be used to perform disease-related research.
This map of the human genome will allow more rapid and efficient
large-scale genetic association studies aimed at discovering
variants contributing to human disease and differential response
to drug treatments. We are one of five funded first phase
U.S. participants in a worldwide initiative that includes
research groups in Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria and the United
Kingdom. We are directly responsible for screening over 15% of
the assays in the first phase of this project. This effort
leverages our Oligator DNA synthesis capability and the
production-scale throughput of our genotyping services
operation. Our BeadLab is being used by organizations
responsible for creating over 60% of the assays in the first
phase of this project, which we expect to be completed in early
2005.

In early 2003, we completed the installation of and recorded
revenue for our first BeadLab, and as of January 2, 2005,
we have installed nine BeadLabs.

In 2003, we announced the launch of several new products,
including 1) a new array format, the Sentrix BeadChip,
which significantly expands market opportunities for our
BeadArray technology and provides increased experimental
flexibility for life science researchers; 2) a gene
expression product line on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and the
Sentrix BeadChip that allows researchers to analyze a focused
set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array; and
3) a benchtop SNP genotyping and gene expression system,
the BeadStation, for performing moderate-scale genotyping and
gene expression using our technology. The BeadStation includes
our BeadArray Reader, analysis software and assay reagents and
is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable
automation needs of individual research groups and core labs.
Sales of these products began in early 2004 and, as of
January 2, 2005, we have shipped 42 BeadStations.



In 2004, we announced the launch of new Sentrix BeadChips for
whole-genome gene expression and whole-genome genotyping. The
whole-genome gene expression BeadChips are designed to enable
high-performance, cost-effective, whole-genome expression
profiling of multiple samples on a single chip, resulting in a
dramatic reduction in cost of whole-genome expression analysis
while allowing researchers to expand the scale and
reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation. The
whole-genome genotyping BeadChip can be scaled to unlimited
levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and
will provide scientists the ability to query, in parallel, a
high-value set of over 100,000 SNPs. In 2004, we also announced
two new versions of the Sentrix Array Matrix designed for
researchers who want to take advantage of our technology, but
whose projects require fewer SNPs per sample than the number
utilized on our standard 1536-plex array products.

In late 2004, we announced a strategic collaboration with
Invitrogen Corporation to synthesize and distribute oligos.
Under the agreement, we intend to expand our Oligator DNA
synthesis technology, and Invitrogen will be responsible for
sales, marketing and technical support. Profits from sales of
collaboration products will be divided equally between the two
companies.

In early 2005, we expanded our gene expression portfolio by
announcing the launch of a new assay, DASL, for generating gene
expression profiles from RNA samples including those containing
partially degraded RNAs. We also announced a standard DASL
cancer panel. Prior to our DASL assay, degraded RNA samples have
been reliably assayed only with expensive, low-multiplex
approaches.

In February 2005, we signed a definitive agreement and plan of
merger with CyVera Corporation, a privately-held
Connecticut-based company, pursuant to which CyVera will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina. CyVera’s
digital-microbead platform is highly complementary to our
portfolio of products and services and upon closing of the
transaction, will become an integral part of our BeadArray
technology. The acquisition is expected to provide us with a
comprehensive approach to bead-based assays for biomarker
R&D and in-vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities,
including those that require low-complexity as well as
high-complexity testing. The aggregate consideration for the
transaction is $17.5 million, consisting of approximately
1.5 million shares of Illumina common stock and the payment
of approximately $2.3 million of CyVera’s liabilities
at the closing. The closing is subject to customary closing
conditions and is expected to occur by the end of March 2005. We
expect the first products based on CyVera’s technology to
be available in the second half in 2006.

We are seeking to expand our customer base for our BeadArray
technology; however, we can give no assurance that our sales
efforts will continue to be successful.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998. We
reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal executive
offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego,
California 92121. Our telephone number is (858) 202-4500.

Industry Background

Genetic Variation and Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each
parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical, or they
may be different. These differences are referred to as genetic
variation. Examples of the physical consequences of genetic
variation include differences in eye and hair color. Genetic
variation can also have important medical consequences,
including predisposition to disease and differential response to
drugs. Genetic variation affects diseases, including cancer,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
In addition, genetic variation may cause people to respond
differently to the same drug. Some people may respond well,
others may not respond at all, and still others may experience
adverse side effects. The most common form of genetic variation
is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, or SNP. A SNP is a
variation in a single position in a DNA sequence. It is
estimated that the human genome contains between three and six
million SNPs.



While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for
medically important effects, it is now believed that the genetic
component of most major diseases is the result of the
interaction of many SNPs. Therefore, it is important to
investigate many SNPs together in order to discover medically
valuable information.

Current efforts to understand genetic variation and function
have primarily centered around SNP genotyping and gene
expression profiling.

SNP Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining which SNPs are
present in each of the two copies of a gene, or other portion of
DNA sequence, within an individual or other organism. The use of
SNP genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of
an individual SNP or a collection of SNPs, and to apply that
information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing, requires
the analysis of millions of SNP genotypes and the testing of
large populations for each disease. For example, a single large
clinical trial could involve genotyping 200,000 SNPs per patient
in 1,000 patients, thus requiring 200 million assays.
Using previously available technologies, this scale of SNP
genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping will be used for a variety of
applications, including genomics-based drug development,
clinical trial analysis, disease predisposition testing, and
disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping can also be used outside of
healthcare, for example in the development of plants and animals
with desirable commercial characteristics. These markets will
require billions of SNP genotyping assays annually.

Gene Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which
genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is
accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary between genes
and proteins. Variation in gene expression can cause disease, or
act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to
disease. By comparing gene expression patterns between cells
from different environments, such as normal tissue compared to
diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug,
specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these
processes can be identified. Studies of this type, used in drug
discovery, require monitoring thousands, and preferably tens of
thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of samples. Once a smaller
set of genes of interest has been identified, researchers can
then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across
numerous samples, for example, within a clinical trial. The high
cost of current gene expression methods has limited the
development of the gene expression market.

As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases,
gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important
diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is
anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the
sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more
cost-effective technologies.



Our Technologies

BeadArray Technology

We have developed a proprietary array technology that enables
the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function. Our
BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate
in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays
that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our BeadArray
technology provides a unique combination of high throughput,
cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We achieve high throughput
with a high density of test sites per array and our ability to
format arrays in either a pattern arranged to match the wells of
standard microtiter plates or in various configurations in the
format of standard microscope slides. We maximize cost
effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and
valuable samples, and from the low manufacturing costs
associated with our technologies. Our ability to vary the size,
shape and format of the well patterns and to create specific
bead pools, or sensors, for different applications provides the
flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments. We
believe that these features have enabled our BeadArray
technology to become a leading platform for the emerging
high-growth market of SNP genotyping and expect they will
enable us to become a key player in the gene expression market.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines microwells etched
into a substrate and specially prepared beads that self-assemble
into an array. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two
different Sentrix array formats, the Array Matrix and the
BeadChip. Our first bead-based product was the Array Matrix
which incorporates fiber optic bundles. We have the fiber optic
bundles manufactured to our specifications, which we cut into
lengths of less than one inch. Each bundle contains
approximately 50,000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles
are placed into an aluminum plate, which forms an Array Matrix.
BeadChips are fabricated in microscope slide-shaped sizes with
varying numbers of sample sites per slide. Both formats are
chemically etched to create tens of thousands of wells for each
sample site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing a specific
type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in
a batch. We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a
given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The
particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function
as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by
attaching a particular DNA sequence to each bead in the batch.
We combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to
the type of array we intend to create. A bead pool one
milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce
thousands of arrays. One of the advantages of this technology is
that it allows us to create universal arrays for SNP genotyping,
and by varying the reagent kit, still be able to use the array
to test for any combination of SNPs.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact
with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the
wells, one bead per well. The tens of thousands of beads in the
wells comprise our individual arrays. Because the beads assemble
randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called
decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which
well in the array. We employ several proprietary methods for
decoding, a process that requires only a few steps to identify
all the beads in the array. One beneficial by-product of the
decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array. This
quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead
and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure
that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by
having multiple copies of each bead type. This improves the
reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing
statistical processing of the results of identical beads.



An experiment is performed on the Array Matrix by preparing a
sample, such as DNA from a patient, and introducing it to the
array. The design features of our Array Matrix allow it to be
simply dipped into a solution containing the sample, whereas our
BeadChip allows processing of samples on a slide. The molecules
in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated
bead. The BeadArray Reader detects the matched molecules by
shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the BeadChip.
Since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes
them to emit light in response to a laser, detection of a
binding event is possible. This allows the measurement of the
number of molecules bound to each coated bead, resulting in a
quantitative analysis of the sample.

Oligator Technology

Genomic applications require many different short pieces of DNA
that can be made synthetically, called oligonucleotides. For
example, SNP genotyping typically requires three to four
different oligonucleotides per assay. A SNP genotyping
experiment analyzing 10,000 SNPs may therefore require 30,000 to
40,000 different oligonucleotides, contributing significantly to
the expense of the experiment.

We have designed our proprietary Oligator technology for the
parallel synthesis of many different oligonucleotides to meet
the requirements of large-scale genomics applications. We
believe that our Oligator technology is substantially more cost
effective and provides higher throughput than available
commercial alternatives. Our synthesis machines are computer
controlled and utilize many robotic processes to minimize the
amount of labor used in the manufacturing process. Each of these
synthesizers can produce up to 3072 oligos in parallel, using
very small amounts of material. We believe both of these
attributes are substantial improvements over other existing
technologies. In 2005, we intend to implement fourth-generation
Oligator technology which will further expand our production
capabilities and extend our technology into tube-based oligo
products.

Key Advantages of Our BeadArray and Oligator
    Technologies

We believe that our BeadArray and Oligator technologies provide
distinct advantages, in a variety of applications, over
competing technologies, by creating cost-effective, highly
miniaturized arrays with the following advantages:

High Throughput.

The miniaturization of our BeadArray
technology provides significantly greater information content
per unit area than any other array known to us. To further
increase throughput, we have formatted our arrays in a pattern
arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates,
allowing throughput levels of up to 150,000 unique assays per
microtiter plate, as well as the use of laboratory robotics to
speed process time. The Oligator’s parallel synthesis
capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of
oligonucleotides necessary to support large-scale genomic
applications.

Cost Effectiveness.

Our array products substantially
reduce the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary
manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost
reductions generated by advances in fiber optics, digital
imaging and bead chemistry. In addition, these products require
smaller reagent volumes than other array technologies, and
therefore reduce reagent costs. Our cost-effective Oligator
technology further reduces reagent costs, as well as the cost of
coating beads.

Flexibility.

A wide variety of conventional chemistries
are available for attaching different molecules, such as DNA,
RNA, proteins, and other chemicals to beads. By using beads, we
are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide
variety of sensors, which we assemble into arrays using the same
proprietary manufacturing process. In addition, we can have
fiber optic bundles and BeadChips manufactured in multiple
shapes and sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to
optimize them for different markets and market segments. In
combination, the use of beads and etched wells provides the
flexibility and scalability for our BeadArray technology to be
tailored to perform many applications in many different market
segments, from drug discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator
technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths
and quantities of oligonucleotides.



Quality.

The high density of beads in each array enables
us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type. We
measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data
point. This allows us to make a comparison of each bead against
its own population of identical beads, which permits the
statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value
for each data point. Finally, the manufacture of the array
includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a
quality control test of every bead on every array, improving the
overall quality of the data.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray platforms the industry
standard for products and services utilizing array technologies.
We plan to achieve this by:

Products and Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray technology, the
Sentrix Array Matrix, is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic
bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96-well
microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle performs more than
1,500 unique assays. Therefore, one Sentrix Array Matrix can
perform nearly 150,000 individual assays simultaneously, more
than any other commercial array system known to us. The
BeadChip, introduced in 2003, is fabricated in multiple
configurations to support multiple applications and scanning
technologies.

We have provided genotyping services using our proprietary
BeadArray technology since 2001. In addition, we have developed
our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this
technology. These products include disposable Sentrix Array
Matrices and BeadChips, GoldenGate reagent kits for SNP
genotyping, BeadArray Reader scanning instruments and an
evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression
products.

SNP Genotyping

In 2001, we introduced the first commercial application of our
BeadArray technology by launching our SNP genotyping services
product line. Since this launch we have had peak days in which
we operated at over two million genotypes per day based on
individual samples. To our knowledge, no other genotyping
platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while
delivering such high accuracy and low cost.

We designed our first consumable BeadArray product, the Sentrix
Array Matrix, for SNP genotyping. The Sentrix Array Matrix uses
a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of SNPs. We
have also developed reagent kits based on GoldenGate assay
protocols and the BeadArray Reader, a laser scanner, which is
used to read our array products.

Depending on throughput and automation requirements, our
customers can select the system configuration to best meet their
needs. For production-scale throughput, our BeadLab would be
appropriate, and for moderate-scale throughput, our BeadStation
would be selected. Our BeadLab includes our BeadArray Reader,
combined with LIMS, standard operating procedures and analytical
software and fluid handling robotics. This production-scale
system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed, this
system can routinely produce up to 1.4 million genotypes
per day.



The BeadStation, a system for performing moderate-scale
genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of
individual research groups and core labs, was commercialized in
late 2003. The BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader and
genotyping and/or gene expression analysis software. Our
BeadStations are fully upgradeable to a full BeadLab through
various steps that add automation, sample preparation equipment
and LIMS capability.

For use in SNP genotyping, both the BeadLab and BeadStation
utilize GoldenGate assay reagents and our Array Matrices and
will soon support a high-density version of our BeadChip. The
Sentrix BeadChip allows simultaneous processing of 16 samples
and uses identical content as the Sentrix Array Matrix.

Also in 2003, we announced the availability of an assay set for
genetic linkage analysis. This standard product has been
deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold
to customers who use our SNP genotyping systems. Genetic linkage
analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential
disease associations across a related set of samples.

In 2004, we announced a new Sentrix BeadChip for whole-genome
genotyping. This BeadChip will provide scientists the ability to
interrogate over 100,000 SNPs located in high-value genetic
regions of the human genome.

Gene Expression Profiling

With the addition of application specific accessory kits, our
production-scale BeadLabs and BeadStations are capable of
performing a growing number of applications including gene
expression profiling.

In 2003, we introduced our focused set gene expression products
on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and Sentrix BeadChip platforms.
For high-throughput projects, our system includes a BeadArray
Reader for imaging Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips, a
hybridization chamber and software for data extraction. For
research projects that require moderate throughput, a version of
the Sentrix BeadChip analyzes eight samples in parallel and can
be scanned on a portion of the installed base of Axon
Instruments’
GenePix

tm

scanners. In addition, we have developed standard gene
expression products for each of the human, mouse and arabidopsis
genomes.

In 2004, we announced the Sentrix Human-6 and HumanRef-8
Expression BeadChip products. Both products will allow
large-scale expression profiling of multiple samples on a single
chip and are imaged using our BeadArray Reader. The Human-6
BeadChip is designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome
samples on one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately
48,000 transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human
genome. The HumanRef-8 BeadChip product analyzes eight samples
in parallel against 24,000 transcripts from the roughly 22,000
genes represented in the consensus RefSeq database, a
well-characterized whole-genome subset used broadly in genetic
analysis. We expect that these new gene expression BeadChips
will dramatically reduce the cost of whole-genome expression
analysis, allowing researchers to expand the scale and
reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation.

In early 2005, we introduced the new DASL assay for generating
gene expression profiles from RNA samples, including
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and other
samples containing degraded RNAs. The DASL assay enables
researchers to measure RNA abundance of over 500 genes in
parallel per sample. We also released a standard DASL cancer
panel. It has been estimated that there are over
400 million FFPE tissue samples archived in North America
for cancer alone. Many of these samples represent known clinical
outcomes which will yield important information when linked with
underlying gene expression profiles. To date, degraded RNA
samples have been reliably assayed only with expensive,
low-multiplex approaches. Our DASL assay generates RNA profiles
at high multiplex and at a low cost per sample as compared to
existing technologies.



Scanning Instrumentation

The BeadArray Reader, an instrument we developed, is a key
component of both our production-scale BeadLab and our benchtop
BeadStation. This scanning equipment uses a laser to read the
results of experiments that are captured on our arrays and was
designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use
our Sentrix Array Matrices and Sentrix BeadChips.

High-Throughput Synthesis

We have put in place an oligonucleotide manufacturing facility
that currently has the capability of producing approximately
20 million oligonucleotides per year. In addition to their
use to coat beads, these oligonucleotides are components of the
reagent kits for our BeadArray products and are used for assay
development. Because our production capacity exceeds our
internal needs, we began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to
high volume users in 2001. We provide oligonucleotides in a wide
range of lengths and in several scales, with the ability to add
many types of modifications. We offer a range of quality control
options and have implemented a laboratory information management
system to control much of the manufacturing process. In 2003, we
introduced the first standard product offerings in our Oligator
product line, a whole-genome oligonucleotide reference set
designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays,
and in 2004, we introduced a mouse genome oligo set, also for
use on spotted gene expression arrays. We believe our Oligator
technology is more cost effective than competing technologies,
which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a
price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross
margins. In 2005, in connection with a collaboration agreement
with Invitrogen Corporation, we intend to implement
fourth-generation Oligator technology which will further expand
our production capabilities and extend our technology into
tube-based oligo products.

Collaboration with Invitrogen Corporation

In December 2004, we entered into a strategic collaboration with
Invitrogen Corporation. Through this collaboration, we intend to
expand our Oligator DNA synthesis technology and combine that
capability with Invitrogen’s sales, marketing and
distribution channels. Under the terms of the agreement,
Invitrogen has agreed to pay us up to $3.4 million, which
we plan to invest in our San Diego facility to enable
implementation of fourth-generation Oligator technology and
extend the technology into tube-based oligo products. In
addition, the agreement provides for the transfer of our
Oligator technology into two Invitrogen facilities outside North
America. Profit from the sale of collaboration products will be
divided equally between the two companies.

Research and Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
complete the development of our products. Our research and
development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies and to
support commercialization of the products and services derived
from these technologies. These efforts include among others:

•

We enhanced the quality and manufacturing yield of our Sentrix
    Array Matrices and BeadChips. We are exploring ways to continue
    to increase the level of automation in the manufacturing process
    to further reduce the time and cost of producing arrays. We
    currently have the infrastructure in place to manufacture
    Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips in sufficient quantity to
    meet anticipated internal and external needs.



Our research and development expenses for the fiscal years 2004,
2003 and 2002 (exclusive of charges relating to stock based
compensation of $0.8 million, $1.3 million and
$2.4 million, respectively) were $21.1 million,
$22.5 million and $26.8 million, respectively. We
expect research and development expense to increase in 2005 as
compared to 2004 as we continue to expand our research and
product development efforts.

Government Grants

Government grants allow us to fund internal scientific programs
and exploratory research. We retain ownership of all
intellectual property and commercial rights generated during
these projects, subject to a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
paid-up license to practice, for or on behalf of the United
States, inventions made with federal funds. This license is
retained by the U.S. government as provided by applicable
statutes and regulations. We do not believe that the retained
license will have any impact on our ability to market our
products, and we do not need government approval with respect to
this license in order to enter into collaborations or other
relationships with third parties. We are the recipient of a
grant from the National Institutes of Health covering our
participation in the first phase of the International HapMap
Project, which is a $100.0 million, internationally funded
successor project to the Human Genome Project that will help
identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform
disease-related research. We could receive up to
$9.1 million of funding for this project which covers basic
research activities, the development of SNP assays and the
genotyping to be performed on those assays. As of the end of
2004, we had approximately $0.7 million of funding
remaining related to this project, which is expected to be
received in early 2005.



Intellectual Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including ownership of,
or exclusive licenses to, 29 issued U.S. patents and 76
pending U.S. patent applications, including seven allowed
applications that have not yet issued as patents, some of which
derive from a common parent application. Our issued patents,
which cover various aspects of our BeadArray, oligonucleotide
synthesis and chemical detection technologies, expire between
2011 and 2020. We are seeking to extend this patent protection
on our BeadArray, GoldenGate, Oligator, Sentrix and related
technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for many of
these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright and
trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets, to
operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third
parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology
or products used with our BeadArray, DASL, GoldenGate, Sentrix
and Oligator technologies.

We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
agreements with third parties, which grant us rights to use key
aspects of our array technology, assay methods, chemical
detection methods, reagent kits and scanning equipment. We have
exclusive licenses from Tufts University to patents that cover
our use of BeadArray technology. These patents were filed by
Dr. David Walt, a member of our board of directors, the
Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and one of our
founders. Our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of
the underlying patents, which will occur between 2010 and 2020.
In 2001, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with
Amersham Biosciences that covers certain technology contained in
our BeadArray Reader. In 2002, we obtained a non-exclusive
license from Dade Behring Marburg GmbH that relates to certain
components of our GoldenGate assay. We also have additional
nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other
components of our products. In all cases, the agreements remain
in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be
terminated at our request without further obligation and require
that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect.

Marketing and Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving SNP
genotyping and gene expression profiling. These experiments may
be involved in many areas of biologic research including basic
human disease research, pharmaceutical drug discovery and
development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and agricultural
research. Our potential customers include pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and consumer products
companies, as well as academic or private research centers. The
genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its
size and speed of development will be ultimately driven by,
among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment,

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and function, and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.



We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
North America, major European markets, Japan and Singapore. In
each of these areas we have dedicated sales, service and
application support personnel responsible for expanding and
managing their respective customer bases. In markets outside of
these areas, primarily the Pacific Rim countries, we sell our
products and provide services to customers through distributors
that specialize in life science products. We expect to
significantly increase our sales and distribution resources
during 2005 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and
expand the number of customers that can use our products.

In late 2004, we entered into a strategic collaboration with
Invitrogen Corporation with a goal of leveraging our strength in
oligo synthesis with Invitrogen’s extensive sales,
marketing and distribution channels. We expect to transition all
responsibility for oligo sales, marketing and technical support
to Invitrogen in 2005.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our array platforms, reagent kits, scanning
equipment and oligonucleotides in-house and believe that we
currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient
quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs. We
currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in
the manufacture of our products. We intend to continue, and may
extend, the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process
to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best
commercial interests.

During 2001, we moved into a new facility which allowed us to
design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes,
and optimize material flow and personnel movement. In addition,
we have implemented information management systems for many of
our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects
of material and sample use. We adhere to access and safety
standards required by federal, state and local health
ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal
of hazardous substances.

Competition

Although we expect that our BeadArray products and services will
provide significant advantages over currently available products
and services, we expect to encounter intense competition from
other companies that offer products and services for the SNP
genotyping and gene expression markets. These include companies
such as Aclara Biosciences (recently acquired by ViroLogic),
Affymetrix, Agilent, Amersham Biosciences (recently acquired by
GE Corp.), Applied Biosystems, Beckman Coulter, Caliper
Technologies, Luminex, ParAllele Bioscience, Perlegen Sciences,
Sequenom and Third Wave Technologies. Many of these companies
have or will have substantially greater financial, technical,
research, and other resources and larger, more established
marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we
do. In addition, they may have greater name recognition than we
do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large
installed base of systems. Each of these markets is very
competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the
intensity of competition to increase in the future. In order to
effectively compete with these companies, we will need to
demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost and
accuracy advantages over the existing products. Rapid
technological development may result in our products or
technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by us could be
made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective
products based on similar or other technologies. Although we
believe that our technology and products will offer advantages
that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies,
we cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Segment and Geographic Information

We operate in one business segment, for the development,
manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis.
Our operations are treated as one segment as we only report
operating results on an aggregate basis to chief operating
decision makers of Illumina.



During 2004, $26.4 million, or 52%, of our total revenues
came from customers outside the United States, as compared to
$14.4 million, or 51%, in 2003. We expect that sales to
international customers will continue to be an important and
growing source of revenues. We have sales support resources in
Western Europe and direct sales offices in Japan and Singapore.
In addition, we have distributor relationships in various
countries in the Pacific Rim region.

Information about the geographies in which we operate can be
found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at
Note 11, “Segment Information, Geographic Data and
Significant Customers.”

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year as customers
spend unused budget allocations before the end of the year.

Environmental Matters

We are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the
environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
materials which subject us to a variety of federal, state and
local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and
regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and
fines should contamination of the environment or individual
exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot
predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the
development of new laws and regulations, will affect our
business operations or the cost of compliance.

Employees

As of January 2, 2005, we had a total of 278 employees, 60
of whom hold Ph.D. degrees and 37 of such Ph.D. degreed
employees are engaged in full-time research and development
activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor
union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.

Item 2.

Properties.

Our principal research and development, manufacturing and
administrative facilities occupy approximately
90,000 square feet of three buildings located in
San Diego, California, which we purchased, along with eight
acres of adjacent land, in January 2002. In connection with this
purchase we assumed a $26 million, 10-year mortgage on the
property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. In June 2004, we
entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and
buildings for $42.0 million and to lease back such property
for an initial term of ten years. The sale was completed in
August 2004, at which time the lease was signed. We expect that
these facilities will be sufficient for our San Diego based
operations for the foreseeable future.

In February 2003, the Company began leasing approximately
3,300 square feet of office space in Tokyo and in January
2004, began leasing approximately 1,600 square feet of
office space in Singapore. These facilities are used by local
sales, marketing and field service personnel.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Termination-of-Employment Lawsuit

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an unspecified
amount was filed against us by a former employee in the Superior
Court of the State of California in connection with the
employee’s termination of employment with Illumina. In July
2002 a California Superior Court judgment was rendered against
the Company and we recorded a $7.7 million charge in our
financial results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover total
damages and remaining expenses. We appealed the decision, and in
December 2004, the Fourth Appellate District Court of Appeal, in
San Diego, California, reduced the amount of the award. We
recorded interest expense on the $7.7 million during the
appeal based on the statutory rate. As a result of the revised
judgment, we reduced the $9.2 million liability on our
balance sheet to $5.9 million and recorded a gain of
$3.3 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter
of 2004.



Litigation with Applera Corporation’s Applied Biosystems
Group

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems initiated a patent
infringement suit and sought to compel arbitration of an alleged
breach of the joint development agreement. In December 2002, we
filed a suit alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and
other allegations against Applied Biosystems in San Diego
Superior Court, and moved to prevent the arbitration of our
joint development agreement sought by Applied Biosystems. In
January 2004, we notified Applied Biosystems that we were
terminating the joint development agreement.

In August 2004, we and Applera entered into a settlement and
cross-license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we
paid Applera a one-time payment of $8.5 million. The
settlement agreement also provided for an exchange of
royalty-free cross-licenses to certain intellectual property
rights, termination of the joint development agreement,
dismissal of the federal patent infringement action brought by
Applied Biosystems, termination of the arbitration proceeding,
and dismissal of our state court action against Applied
Biosystems.

Our financial statements included a $10.0 million advance
payment from Applied Biosystems that would have been deducted
from the profits otherwise payable to us from Applied
Biosystems. As a result of the settlement agreement, we removed
this $10.0 million liability from our balance sheet, made a
payment of $8.5 million to Applera and recorded a gain of
$1.5 million as a litigation settlement.

Affymetrix Litigation

In July 2004, Affymetrix filed a complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
that certain of our products infringe six Affymetrix patents.
The suit seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a
judgment enjoining the sale of products, if any, that are
determined to be infringing these patents. In September 2004, we
filed our answer and counterclaims to Affymetrix’
complaint, seeking declaratory judgments from the court that we
do not infringe the Affymetrix patents and that such patents are
invalid, and filed counterclaims against Affymetrix for unfair
competition and interference with actual and prospective
economic advantage. We believe we have meritorious defenses
against each of the infringement claims alleged by Affymetrix
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this suit.
However, we cannot be sure we will prevail in this matter. Any
unfavorable determination, and in particular, any significant
cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the
sale of our products and services, could result in a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. While the parties have pending motions before the
court, no trial date has yet been set for this case.



Item 4.

or contribute to these differences include those discussed in
“Factors Affecting Operating Results” below as well as
those discussed elsewhere.

Overview

Illumina, Inc. was incorporated in April 1998. We develop and
market next-generation tools for the large-scale analysis of
genetic variation and function. Understanding genetic variation
and function is critical to the development of personalized
medicine, a key goal of genomics. Using our technologies, we
have developed a comprehensive line of products that are
designed to provide the throughput, cost effectiveness and
flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences
and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests
necessary to extract medically valuable information from
advances in genomics. This information is expected to correlate
genetic variation and gene function with particular disease
states, enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to be
detected earlier and more specifically, and permitting better
choices of drugs for individual patients.

In 2001, we began commercial sale of short pieces of DNA, or
oligos, manufactured using our proprietary Oligator technology.
We believe our Oligator technology is more cost effective than
competing technologies, which has allowed us to market our
oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still
achieving attractive gross margins. In 2001, we also initiated
our SNP genotyping services product line. As a result of the
increasing market acceptance of our high throughput, low cost
BeadArray technology, we have entered into genotyping services
contracts with many leading genotyping centers, and have been
awarded $9.1 million from the National Institutes of Health
to play a major role in the first phase of the International
HapMap Project.



Our production-scale BeadLab is based on the system we developed
that has been operational in our genotyping service product line
since 2001. In addition to our Sentrix Array Matrices, it
includes the BeadArray Reader, a proprietary scanner that uses a
laser to read the results of experiments captured on our arrays,
as well as the GoldenGate SNP genotyping assay which can analyze
up to 1536 SNPs per DNA sample. This system is being marketed to
a small number of high throughput genotyping users. As of
January 2, 2005, we have installed and recorded revenue for
nine BeadLabs.

In 2003, we announced the launch of several new products,
including 1) a new array format, the Sentrix BeadChip,
which significantly expands market opportunities for our
BeadArray technology and provides increased experimental
flexibility for life science researchers; 2) a gene
expression product line on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and the
Sentrix BeadChip that allows researchers to analyze a focused
set of genes across eight to 96 samples on a single array; and
3) a benchtop SNP genotyping and gene expression system,
the BeadStation, for performing moderate-scale genotyping and
gene expression using our technology. The BeadStation includes
our BeadArray Reader, analysis software and assay reagents and
is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable
automation needs of individual research groups and core labs.
Sales of these products began in the first quarter of 2004 and,
as of January 2, 2005, we have shipped 42 BeadStations.

In 2004, we announced the launch of new Sentrix BeadChips for
whole-genome gene expression and whole-genome genotyping. The
whole-genome gene expression BeadChips are designed to enable
high-performance, cost-effective, whole-genome expression
profiling of multiple samples on a single chip, resulting in a
dramatic reduction in cost of whole-genome expression analysis
while allowing researchers to expand the scale and
reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation. The
whole-genome genotyping BeadChip can be scaled to unlimited
levels of multiplexing without compromising data quality and
will provide scientists the ability to query hundreds of
thousands of SNPs in parallel. In 2004, we also announced two
new versions of the Sentrix Array Matrix designed for
researchers who want to take advantage of our technology, but
whose projects require fewer SNPs per sample than the number
utilized on our standard 1536-plex array products.

In late 2004, we announced a strategic collaboration with
Invitrogen Corporation to synthesize and distribute oligos.
Under the agreement, we intend to expand our Oligator DNA
synthesis technology to include both plate and tube based
capability and Invitrogen will be responsible for sales,
marketing and technical support. Profits from sales of
collaboration products will be divided equally between the two
companies.

In early 2005, we expanded our gene expression portfolio by
announcing the launch of a new assay, DASL, for generating gene
expression profiles from RNA samples including those containing
partially degraded RNAs. We also announced a standard DASL
cancer panel. Prior to our DASL assay, degraded RNA samples have
been reliably assayed only with expensive, low-multiplex
approaches.

In February 2005, we signed a definitive agreement and plan of
merger with CyVera Corporation, a privately-held
Connecticut-based company, pursuant to which CyVera will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Illumina. CyVera’s
digital-microbead platform is highly complementary to our
portfolio of products and services and upon closing of the
transaction, will become an integral part of our BeadArray
technology. The acquisition is expected to provide us with a
comprehensive approach to bead-based assays for biomarker
R&D and in-vitro and molecular diagnostic opportunities,
including those that require low-complexity as well as
high-complexity testing. The aggregate consideration for the
transaction is $17.5 million, consisting of approximately
1.5 million shares of Illumina common stock and the payment
of approximately $2.3 million of CyVera’s liabilities
at the closing. The closing is subject to customary closing
conditions and is expected to occur by the end of March 2005. We
expect the first products based on CyVera’s technology to
be available in the second half in 2006.

We are seeking to expand our customer base for our BeadArray
technology; however, we can give no assurance that our sales
efforts will continue to be successful.



Our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of
seasonal spending patterns, the timing and amount of government
grant funding programs, the timing and size of research projects
our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the
life science industry and other unpredictable factors that may
affect our customer ordering patterns. Approximately 30% of our
revenues for the year 2004 resulted from transactions that were
funded under the International HapMap Project. We currently
expect that most of the activities under this grant involving
the Company and its customers will be completed in early 2005.
We expect that the planned commercial launch of our whole genome
genotyping and gene expression arrays, combined with the
continued expansion of our existing product lines, will offset
the loss of revenues funded by the HapMap grant and will drive
future revenue growth. However, any significant delays in the
commercial launch of these new products, unfavorable sales
trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other
factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue
growth in 2005 or cause a sequential decline in quarterly
revenues. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue
and net income or loss, we believe quarterly comparisons of our
operating results are not a good indication of our future
performance.

We have incurred substantial operating losses since our
inception. As of January 2, 2005, our accumulated deficit
was $123.7 million, and total stockholders’ equity was
$72.3 million. These losses have principally occurred as a
result of the substantial resources required for the research,
development and manufacturing scale up effort required to
commercialize our products and services, as well as charges of
$5.9 million related to a termination-of-employment
lawsuit. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for
research, development and manufacturing scale up activities over
the next several years. We will also need to significantly
increase our selling, general and administrative costs as we
build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and
support the sale of systems, other products and services. As a
result of the expected increase in expenses, we will need to
increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability.

Critical Accounting Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of financial statements requires that management
make estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to the
application of accounting policies that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
to our consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting
policies are deemed critical if 1) they require an
accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were
highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2)
changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, or
different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Management has discussed the development and selection of these
critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our
Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our
financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed
critical as defined above.

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect
our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.



Revenue Recognition

Our sales are primarily from two sources: product revenue and
services revenue. Product revenue consists of sales of
oligonucleotides, arrays, assay reagents, genotyping systems and
gene expression systems. Services revenue consists of revenue
received for performing genotyping services and extended
warranty sales. As described below, significant judgments and
estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue
recognized in any accounting period.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines
established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 104. Under SAB 104, revenue cannot be
recorded until all of the following criteria have been met:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
reasonably assured.

Product delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a
common carrier or when the customer receives the product,
depending on the nature of the arrangement and provided no
significant obligations remain. BeadLabs are considered
delivered upon shipment, installation, training and fulfillment
of contractually defined acceptance criteria and we need to
determine the completion of each of these deliverables before
revenue can be recognized. Genotyping services are considered
delivered generally at the time the genotyping data is delivered
to the customer. We have been awarded $9.1 million from the
National Institutes of Health to perform genotyping services in
connection with the first phase of the International HapMap
Project. A portion of the services related to this project is
considered delivered at the time the related costs are incurred
while the remainder is considered delivered upon the delivery of
genotyping data.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based
on future performance, we defer revenue recognition until the
price becomes fixed and determinable. We assess collectibility
based on a number of factors, including past transaction history
with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If
we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably
assured, we defer revenue recognition until the time collection
becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of
payment. Changes in judgments and estimates made in determining
whether the criteria of SAB 104 have been met might result
in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized.

Sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems include a
standard one year warranty. We also sell separately priced
maintenance (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally
for one or two years, upon the expiration of the initial
warranty. Revenue for extended warranty sales is recognized
ratably over the term of the extended warranty. Reserves are
provided for estimated product warranty expenses at the time the
associated revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an
increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing our
warrantied products were greater than our estimates, our gross
margins could be adversely affected.

While the majority of our sales agreements contain standard
terms and conditions, we do enter into agreements that contain
multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Emerging
Issues Task Force No. 00-21 (“EITF 00-21”),
“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”,
provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve
the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to
determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should
be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue
recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be
allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize
revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue
should be recognized. We recognize revenue for delivered
elements only when we believe the fair values of undelivered
elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding
customer acceptance.



A third source of revenue, research revenue, consists of amounts
earned under research agreements with government grants, which
is recognized in the period during which the related costs are
incurred. All revenues are recorded net of any applicable
allowances for returns or discounts.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates. If
the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
additional allowances could be required.

Inventory Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
market conditions and the release of new products that will
supercede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
obsolete products and components, taking into account product
life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality
issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated,
additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
intellectual property matters. Based on the information
available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation
with our legal counsel, we assess the likelihood of any adverse
judgments or outcomes of these matters, as well as the potential
ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably
estimable, we will record a reserve in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting
for Contingencies”. Currently we have no such reserves
recorded. Any reserves recorded in the future may change due to
new developments in each matter.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which is a revision
of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(SFAS 123). This statement supercedes APB
Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25), and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows.

Generally, the approach in
SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in
SFAS 123; however, SFAS 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
We currently utilize the Black-Scholes model to measure the fair
value of stock options granted to employees under the pro forma
disclosure requirements of FAS 123. While SFAS 123R
permits companies to continue to use such model, it also permits
the use of a “lattice” model. We have not yet
determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of
employee stock options under the adoption for SFAS 123R.
The new standard is effective for periods beginning after
June 15, 2005, and we expect to adopt SFAS 123R on
July 4, 2005.



We currently account for share-based payments to employees using
APB 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such,
recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options
granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair
value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Accordingly,
the adoption of SFAS 123R’s fair value method is
expected to result in significant non-cash charges which will
increase our reported operating expenses; however, it will have
no impact on our cash flows. The impact of adoption of
SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will
depend on the level of share-based payments granted in the
future and the model we choose to use. However, had we adopted
SFAS 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard
would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described
in the disclosure of pro forma net loss under Stock-Based
Compensation in Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements.

Revenue for the years ended January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003 was $50.6 million and
$28.0 million, respectively. Product revenue increased to
$40.5 million in 2004 from $18.4 million in 2003. The
increase resulted almost entirely from sales of consumables used
on our BeadLabs and BeadStations and sales of our benchtop
BeadStations, offset by fewer sales of our production-scale
BeadLabs. In 2003, we had no sales of BeadStations and we only
began selling consumable products in May 2003.

Service revenue increased to $8.1 million in 2004 from
$6.5 million in 2003. Substantially all of this increase
relates to SNP genotyping services performed for the
International HapMap Project. We are the recipient of a grant
from the National Institutes of Health covering our
participation in the first phase of the International HapMap
Project, which is a $100 million internationally funded
successor project to the Human Genome Project that will help
identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform
disease-related research. We could receive up to
$9.1 million of funding for this project which covers basic
research activities, the development of SNP assays and the
genotyping to be performed on those assays. We have recognized
revenue under this grant of $8.4 million and, as of the end
of 2004, we had approximately $0.7 million of funding
remaining related to this project which is expected to be
received in early 2005.

Government grants and other research funding decreased to
$2.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2005 from
$3.2 million for the year ended December  28,
2003 primarily due to a decrease in internal research spending
for our grant from the National Institutes of Health covering
our participation in the International HapMap Project. We expect
government grants to decline as a percentage of total revenues.

To expand revenue in the future, we have recently launched a
series of new products that we expect to begin selling in 2005.
These include a new assay, DASL, for generating gene expression
profiles from RNA samples including those containing partially
degraded RNAs, two multi-sample whole genome gene expression
BeadChips and a whole genome genotyping BeadChip. Our BeadLabs
address a limited number of potential high throughput genotyping
customers, and sales of these systems may decline in 2005 versus
2004. In addition, approximately 30% of our revenues for the
year 2004 resulted from transactions that were funded under the
International HapMap Project. We expect that most of the
activities under this grant involving us and our customers will
be completed in early 2005 and that revenue related to this
project will decline in 2005 versus 2004. We expect the sales of
the new products mentioned above, combined with increased sales
of BeadStations and revenue generated from our collaboration
with Invitrogen, to offset such declines and for overall
revenues to increase above 2004 levels; however, we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in these sales efforts.

Cost of product and service revenue represents manufacturing
costs incurred in the production process, including component
materials, assembly labor and overhead, packaging and delivery
cost. Costs related to research revenue is included in research
and development expense.

Cost of product revenue increased to $11.6 million for the
year ended January 2, 2005 from $7.4 million for the
year ended December 28, 2003. Substantially all of this
increase was driven by the sales of our BeadStations and
consumables. Gross margin on product revenue increased to 71% in
the year ended January 2, 2005, from 60% for the year ended
December 28, 2003, due primarily to increased sales of
higher margin consumable products, as well as efficiencies
gained in oligo manufacturing.

Cost of service revenue decreased to $1.7 million for the
year ended January 2, 2005 from $2.6 million for the
year ended December 28, 2003 and gross margin on service
revenue increased to 79% in the year ended January 2, 2005,
from 60% for the year ended December 28, 2003. This
decrease in cost and increase in gross margin is due primarily
to efficiencies gained in SNP genotyping services, as well as
lower costs of oligos used in the genotyping services process.

We expect product mix will continue to affect our future gross
margins, and any increase in the proportion of consumable sales
to total sales will continue to favorably affect our gross
margins. However, we expect our market will become increasingly
price competitive, and over the longer term, our margins may
decline.

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of
salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory
supplies and other expenses related to the design, development,
testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research
and development expenses as they are incurred. Research and
development expenses decreased $1.4 million to
$21.1 million for the year ended January 2, 2005 from
$22.5 million for the year ended December  28,
2003. Approximately $0.9 million of the decrease is
attributable to personnel related expenses and related lab
supplies and the majority of the remaining $0.5 million is
attributable to lower manufacturing-related resources needed to
support research efforts and a decrease in depreciation expense.

During the year ended January 2, 2005, the cost of
BeadArray technology research activities decreased
$0.4 million as compared to the year ended
December 28, 2003. The decrease is primarily the result of
completing the development of several products that were
commercially launched in late 2003 and 2004 such as our
BeadStation and focused gene set array products.

Research to support our Oligator technology platform decreased
$1.0 million in the year ended January 2, 2005 as
compared to the year ended December 28, 2003. In the second
quarter of 2003, we implemented additional Oligator
manufacturing and software enhancements to expand capacity,
increase throughput, and further reduce operating costs. In
addition, as we increase our product sales, a smaller portion of
our manufacturing resources are now used to support research
efforts as compared to the same periods in 2003.



We expect that our research and development expenses will
increase in the near term due to the allocation to research and
development of rent expense from the new lease on our building
and increased spending levels for new product development. In
addition, we expect an increase in research and development
expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of CyVera
Corporation, which is expected to close in March 2005.

Stock based compensation related to research and development
employees and consultants was $0.3 million for the year
ended January 2, 2005 as compared to $1.3 million for
the year ended December 28, 2003.

expenses increased $6.2 million to $25.1 million for
the year ended January 2, 2005 from $18.9 million for
the year ended December 28, 2003. Approximately
$5.2 million of the increase is due to higher sales and
marketing costs, of which $4.1 million is attributable to
personnel related expenses and $0.7 million is attributable
to an increase in facility related expenses. Approximately
$1.0 million of the increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses is related to general and administrative
costs, of which $0.4 million is related to personnel
related expenses, and the majority of the remaining
$0.6 million is attributable to expenses associated with
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and our international expansion. We
expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses
will accelerate as we expand our staff, add sales and marketing
infrastructure, incur additional costs to support the
commercialization and support of an increasing number of
products, and due to the allocation to selling, general and
administrative of rent expense from the new lease on our
building.

Stock based compensation related to selling, general and

From our inception through July 27, 2000, in connection
with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted
stock to employees, founders and directors, we have recorded
deferred stock compensation totaling $17.6 million,
representing the difference between the exercise or purchase
price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for
financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were
granted or such restricted stock was sold. We recorded this
amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize
the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of
the restricted stock and options.



We recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for
employees, founders and directors, using an accelerated
amortization methodology in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 28. For consultants,
deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the
options granted or stock sold in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 and is periodically
re-measured and expensed in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force No. 96-18.

We recorded amortization of deferred compensation of
$0.8 million and $2.5 million for the years ended
January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively.
We expect expenses related to stock based compensation to
increase significantly beginning in the third quarter of 2005 as
we implement the requirements of SFAS 123R. Although the
adoption of SFAS 123R’s fair value method is expected
to result in a significant increase in our reported operating
expenses, it will have no impact on our cash flows.
SFAS 123R is discussed further in “Recently Issued
Accounting Standards” above and Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements.

A $7.7 million charge was recorded in June 2002 to cover
total damages and estimated expenses related to a jury verdict
in a termination-of-employment lawsuit. We appealed the
decision, and in December 2004, the Fourth Appellate District
Court of Appeal, in San Diego, California, reduced the
amount of the award. During the appeal process, the court
required us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at
statutory rates until the case was resolved. For the years ended
January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003 we recorded
$0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as
litigation expense for such interest charges. As a result of the
revised judgment, we reduced the $9.2 million liability on
our balance sheet to $5.9 million and recorded a gain of
$3.3 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter
of 2004.

In 1999, we entered into a joint development agreement with
Applied Biosystems Group, an operating group of Applera
Corporation, under which the companies agreed to jointly develop
a SNP genotyping system that would combine our BeadArray
technology with Applied Biosystems’ assay chemistry and
scanner technology. In conjunction with the agreement, Applied
Biosystems agreed to provide us with non-refundable research and
development support of $10.0 million, all of which was
provided by December 2001. As of December 28, 2003, this
amount was recorded on our balance sheet as an advance payment
from a former collaborator. In December 2002, Applied Biosystems
initiated a patent infringement suit and sought to compel
arbitration of an alleged breach of the joint development
agreement. We initiated a suit in state court seeking to enjoin
the arbitration and alleged that Applied Biosystems had breached
the joint development agreement. In August 2004, we entered into
a settlement and cross-license agreement with Applera. As a
result of the settlement, we removed the $10.0 million
liability from our balance sheet, made a payment of
$8.5 million to Applera and recorded a gain of
$1.5 million as a litigation settlement.

Provision for Income Taxes

We incurred net operating losses for the years ended
January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, and
accordingly, we did not pay any U.S. federal or state
income taxes. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the
full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset, as the
future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain. As of
January 2, 2005, we had net operating loss carryforwards
for federal and state tax purposes of approximately
$86.5 million and $39.1 million, respectively, which
begin to expire in 2018, unless previously utilized.

We also had U.S. federal and state research and development
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $3.1 million and
$3.0 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2018,
unless previously utilized.

Our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be
subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to
Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, and
similar state provisions, as a result of changes in our
ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the
expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to
utilization.

Revenue for the years ended December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002 was $28.0 million and
$10.0 million, respectively. Product revenue increased to
$18.4 million in 2003 from $4.1 million in 2002. The
increase resulted almost entirely from the first sales of our
BeadLab, with six systems sold in the year ended
December 28, 2003, along with sales of consumables that are
used on these systems. Prior to 2003 we had no sales of BeadLabs
or consumable products. SNP genotyping service revenue increased
to $6.5 million in 2003 from $3.3 million in 2002.
Substantially all of this increase relates to genotyping
services performed for the International HapMap Project, which
commenced in 2003. Government grants and other research funding
increased to $3.2 million for the year ended
December 28, 2003 from $2.6 million for the year ended
December 29, 2002 due to an increase in the number of
grants received.

product revenue increased to 60% in the year ended
December 28, 2003, from 56% for the year ended
December  29, 2002. This increase is due primarily to
increased sales of higher margin products such as array matrices
and assay reagents.

Cost of service revenue increased to $2.6 million the year
ended December  28, 2003 from $1.7 million for
the year ended December 29, 2002. Substantially all of this
increase was driven by the higher level of SNP genotyping

During the year ended December 28, 2003, the cost of
BeadArray technology research activities decreased
$3.8 million as compared to the year ended
December 29, 2002. The decrease occurred primarily as a
result of completing the development of new products launched in
2003. In addition, as we completed development efforts and
increased our array-driven product sales, a smaller portion of
our manufacturing resources was charged to research and
development expense in 2003 than in 2002.

Research to support our Oligator technology platform decreased
$0.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2003 as
compared to the year ended December 29, 2002. This decline
is primarily due to higher development expenses incurred in the
first quarter of 2002 for a major upgrade of our Oligator
technology, which resulted in a significant increase in our
manufacturing capacity.

Stock based compensation related to research and development
employees and consultants was $1.3 million for the year

due to legal proceedings regarding the disputes with Applied
Biosystems. Approximately $4.1 million of the increase is
due to higher sales and marketing costs, of which
$3.0 million is attributable to personnel related expenses
while the majority of the remaining $1.1 million is
attributable to an increase in facility related expenses. During
2003, we significantly expanded our sales and marketing
resources to support the direct sale of our new products,
including establishing additional sales operations in Japan and
Singapore.

Stock based compensation related to selling, general and

As of January 2, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and
investments (including restricted cash and investments of
$12.2 million) of approximately $67.0 million. We
currently invest our funds in U.S. dollar based
investment-grade corporate and government debt securities, with
strong credit ratings or short maturity mutual funds providing
similar financial returns.

Our operating activities used cash of $19.6 million in the
year ended January 2, 2005, as compared to
$18.3 million in the year ended December 28, 2003. Net
cash used in operating activities in the year ended
January 2, 2005 was primarily the result of a net loss from
operations of $6.2 million, the payment of an
$8.5 million legal settlement, as described under
“Litigation Judgment (Settlement), net” above, a
$7.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to
increased sales and a $2.0 million increase in other assets
primarily for the security deposit for the building lease,
reduced by non-cash charges of $4.0 million for
depreciation and amortization. Net cash used in operating
activities in the year ended December 28, 2003 was
primarily the result of a net loss from operations of
$27.1 million reduced by non-cash charges of
$4.5 million for depreciation and amortization and non-cash
charges of $2.5 million for amortization of deferred stock
compensation.

Our investing activities provided cash of $57.0 million in
the year ended January 2, 2005 as compared to
$28.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2003.
Cash provided in investing activities in the year ended
January 2, 2005 was due to $40.7 million in proceeds
from the sale of our land and buildings, net of fees, and
$19.8 million from the sale or maturity of investment
securities, net of purchases of investment securities used to
provide operating funds for our business, reduced by
$3.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment.
Cash provided in investing activities in the year ended
December  28, 2003 was due primarily to
$30.5 million from the sale or maturity of investment
securities, net of purchases of investment securities used to
provide operating funds for our business, reduced by
$2.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment.



Our financing activities provided $4.9 million in the year
ended January  2, 2005 as compared to
$0.2 million in the year ended December 28, 2003. Cash
provided in financing activities in the year ended
January 2, 2005 was due primarily to proceeds from the
issuance of common stock, including $28.7 million of net
proceeds from the sale of approximately 4.6 million shares
of our common stock in May 2004, offset by the
$25.2 million in long term debt we paid off in connection
with the sale of our land and buildings. Cash provided in
financing activities in the year ended December 28, 2003
was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock
reduced by payments on long-term debt and equipment financings.

In June 2002, we recorded a $7.7 million charge to cover
total damages and estimated expenses related to a
termination-of-employment lawsuit. As a result of our decision
to appeal the ruling, we filed a surety bond with the court in
October 2002 of 1.5 times the judgment amount, or approximately
$11.3 million. Under the terms of the bond, we were
required to maintain a letter of credit for 90% of the bond
amount to secure the bond. Further, we were required to deposit
approximately $12.5 million of marketable securities as
collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly, these funds
were restricted from use for corporate purposes. A judgment was
rendered in December 2004 and a $5.9 million payment was
made in early 2005 at which time the restricted funds were
released.

As of January 2, 2005, we had funding remaining under
existing NIH grants of approximately $1.5 million,
including $0.7 million available under the International
HapMap Project. All of these amounts are expected to be paid in
2005, subject to the actual amount of activities we perform
under these grants.

Based on our current operating plans, we expect that our current
cash and cash equivalents, investments, revenues from sales and
funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated
operating needs for at least 24 months. Operating needs
include the planned costs to operate our business including
amounts required to fund working capital and capital
expenditures. At the current time, we have no material
commitments for capital expenditures. However, our future
capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds
will depend on many factors, including our ability to
successfully commercialize our SNP genotyping and gene
expression systems and extensions to those products and to
expand our oligonucleotide and SNP genotyping services product
lines, scientific progress in our research and development
programs, the magnitude of those programs, competing
technological and market developments, the successful resolution
of our legal proceedings with Affymetrix, the success of our
collaboration with Invitrogen and the need to enter into
collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies
or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service
offerings. Therefore, we may require additional funding within
this 24 month time frame. In addition, we may choose to
raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic
considerations, such as an acquisition, even if we believe we
have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.
Further, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our
then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights.

In December, 2003, we filed a shelf registration statement that
would allow us to raise up to $65 million of funding
through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions. In
May 2004, we raised approximately $28.7 million, net of
offering expenses, through the sale of our common stock under
this shelf registration statement. We currently do not have
plans to raise additional funds under this registration
statement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
    Obligations

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. As of January  2, 2005, we are not
involved in any SPE transactions.



In January 2002, we purchased two newly constructed buildings
and assumed a $26.0 million, 10-year mortgage on the
property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. In June 2004, we
entered into a conditional agreement to sell our land and
buildings for $42.0 million and to lease back such property
for an initial term of ten years. The sale was completed in
August 2004 at which time the lease was signed. After the
repayment of the remaining $25.2 million debt and other
related transaction expenses, we received $15.5 million in
net cash proceeds. We removed the land and net book value of the
buildings of $36.9 million from our balance sheet and are
recording the resulting $3.7 million gain on the sale of
the property over the ten year lease term in accordance with
SFAS 13,

Accounting for Leases.

Under the terms of
the lease, we made a $1.9 million security deposit and are
paying monthly rent of $318,643 for the first year with an
annual increase of 3% in each subsequent year.

We also lease office space under non-cancelable operating leases
that expire at various times through January 2007. These leases
contain renewal options ranging from 2 to 3 years.

As of January 2, 2005, our enforceable and legally binding

Factors Affecting Our Operating Results

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
described below. In addition to the other information included
in this Form 10-K, the following issues could adversely
affect our operating results or our stock price.



Litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of
    intellectual property infringement could require us to spend
    significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our
    products or services.

Our commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement
of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the
ability to protect our own intellectual property. While we
recently settled our litigation with Applera Corporation’s
Applied Biosystems Group in August 2004, Affymetrix filed a
complaint against us in July 2004, alleging infringement of six
of its patents, and other third parties have or may assert that
we are employing their proprietary technology without
authorization. As we enter new markets, we expect that
competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their
intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to
impede our successful entry into those markets. In addition,
third parties have or may obtain patents in the future and claim
that use of our technologies infringes these patents. We could
incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our
management and technical personnel in defending ourselves
against any of these claims. We may incur the same costs and
diversions in enforcing our patents against others. Furthermore,
parties making claims against us may be able to obtain
injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our
ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products, and
could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In
the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we
may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses
from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain
products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a
reasonable cost, or at all. In that event, we could encounter
delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop
alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or
failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from
commercializing available products, and the prohibition of sale
of any of our products could materially affect our ability to
grow and to attain profitability.

We expect intense competition in our target markets, which
    could render our products obsolete, result in significant price
    reductions or substantially limit the volume of products that we
    sell. This would limit our ability to compete and achieve
    profitability. If we cannot continuously develop and
    commercialize new products, our revenues may not grow as
    intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture
and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and
function and other applications using technologies such as
two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, mass
spectrometry, flow cytometry, microfluidics, and mechanically
deposited, inkjet and photolithographic arrays. We anticipate
that we will face increased competition in the future as
existing companies develop new or improved products and as new
companies enter the market with new technologies. The markets
for our products are characterized by rapidly changing
technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
needs, emerging competition, new product introductions and
strong price competition. For example, Affymetrix recently
released a 100k SNP genotyping chip and has announced a 500k
chip which will compete with our SNP genotyping service and
product offerings and several competitors have begun selling a
single chip for whole human genome expression which may compete
with our gene expression product offerings. One or more of our
competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical.
Our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources,
broader product lines, a more established customer base and more
experience in research and development than we have.
Furthermore, the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies,
which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could
develop competing products. If we are unable to develop
enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product
offerings, our business, financial condition and results of
operations will suffer.



We have generated only moderate amounts of revenue from
    product and service offerings to date. We expect to continue to
    incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain
    profitability.

We have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to
continue to incur net losses at least through early 2005. At
January 2, 2005 our accumulated deficit was approximately
$123.7 million, and we incurred a net loss of
$6.2 million for the year ended January 2, 2005. The
magnitude of our net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of
growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses.
We expect to continue incurring significant expenses for
research and development, for developing our manufacturing
capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to
commercialize our products. In addition, we expect that our
selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in
the future as a result of the launch of new products. As a
result, we expect that our operating expenses will increase
significantly as we grow and, consequently, we will need to
generate significant additional revenue to achieve
profitability. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be
able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or
annual basis.

We have a limited history of commercial sales of systems
    and consumable products, and our success depends on our ability
    to develop commercially successful products and on market
    acceptance of our new and relatively unproven
    technologies.

We may not possess all of the resources, capability and
intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all
the products or services that may result from our technologies.
Sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began
in 2003, and some of our other technologies are in the early
stages of commercialization or are still in development. You
should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and
complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing
tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. We
must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and
development before some of our products will be ready for sale
and we currently have fewer resources available for research and
development activities than many of our competitors. We may not
be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or
at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of
sufficient quality or price that enables us to compete
effectively in the marketplace. Problems frequently encountered
in connection with the development or early commercialization of
products and services using new and relatively unproven
technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully
commercialize these products and services. In addition, we may
need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property
necessary to commercialize some of our products or services.

Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have
analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of
technologies. In order to be successful, our products must meet
the commercial requirements of the life sciences and
pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large-scale analysis
of genetic variation and function.

Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:



Any inability to adequately protect our proprietary
    technologies could harm our competitive position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents
and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in
the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
many companies have encountered significant problems in
protecting their proprietary rights abroad. These problems can
be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending
intellectual property rights.

The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
sciences and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent
position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and
factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary
rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent
that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and
enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade
secrets. We will apply for patents covering our technologies and
products, as we deem appropriate. However, our patent
applications may be challenged and may not result in issued
patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain
may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing
our technologies or from developing competing products. There
also is risk that others may independently develop similar or
alternative technologies or design around our patented
technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us with any
competitive advantage. We may need to initiate additional
lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against
third party claims, which would be expensive and, if we lose,
may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights
and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential
and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to
protect our proprietary information. These measures, however,
may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or
other proprietary information. We seek to protect our
proprietary information by entering into confidentiality
agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants.
Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or consultants may still
disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to
meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade
secrets.

We have limited experience in manufacturing commercial
    products.

We have limited experience manufacturing our products in the
volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant
commercial sales. We have only recently begun manufacturing
products on a commercial-scale and, in the past, we have
experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have
temporarily reduced production yields. Due to the intricate
nature of manufacturing products that contain DNA, we may
encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing
difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce
production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these
products, or to produce them economically, may prevent us from
achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices
that hinder wide adoption by customers.



Our sales, marketing and technical support organization
    may limit our ability to sell our products.

We currently have fewer resources available for sales and
marketing and technical support services as compared to our
primary competitors and have only recently established a small
direct sales force and customer support team. In order to
effectively commercialize our genotyping and gene expression
systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our
sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically
and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or
maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution
arrangements to market our products and services. In addition,
we compete primarily with much larger companies, that have
larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed
base of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales
and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market
acceptance of our products required to support continued growth
of our business.

If we are unable to develop and maintain operation of our
    manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at all.

We currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing
our products and services for both sale to our customers and
internal use. If a natural disaster were to significantly damage
our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to
fail, these events could prevent us from developing and
manufacturing our products and services.

If we are unable to find third-party manufacturers to
    manufacture components of our products, we may not be able to
    launch or support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

The nature of our products requires customized components that
currently are available from a limited number of sources. For
example, we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and
BeadChip slides included in our products from single vendors. If
we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other
product components, we will be unable to meet demand for our
products. We may need to enter into contractual relationships
with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of
our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and we
cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely
basis, for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable
terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain
reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable
costs.

We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth.
    These difficulties could increase our losses.

We expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to
achieve our operating plans, which will place a strain on our
human and capital resources. If we are unable to manage this
growth effectively, our losses could increase. Our ability to
manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to
continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial
and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and to
attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. If
we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our
manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or
timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing
systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available
the products required to successfully commercialize our
technology. Failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of
talented employees will further strain our human resources and
could impede our growth.



We may need additional capital in the future. If
    additional capital is not available on acceptable terms, we may
    have to curtail or cease operations.

Our future capital requirements will be substantial and will
depend on many factors including our ability to successfully
market our genetic analysis systems and services, the need for
capital expenditures to support and expand our business, the
progress and scope of our research and development projects, the
filing, prosecution and enforcement of patent claims, the
outcome of our legal proceedings with Affymetrix and the need to
enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other
companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product
and service offerings. We anticipate that our existing capital
resources will enable us to maintain currently planned
operations for at least 24 months. However, we premise this
expectation on our current operating plan, which may change as a
result of many factors. Consequently, we may need additional
funding within this timeframe. Our inability to raise capital
would seriously harm our business and product development
efforts. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital
due to market conditions or strategic considerations, such as an
acquisition, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our
current or future operating plans. To the extent that additional
capital is raised through the sale of equity, the issuance of
these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.

We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of
capital available as of January 2, 2005. To the extent
operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future
requirements; we will have to raise additional funds to continue
the development and commercialization of our technologies. These
funds may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If
adequate funds are not available on attractive terms, we may be
required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds
by entering into financing, supply or collaboration agreements
on unattractive terms.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and
    retain additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our
    goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief
executive officer, David Barker, our vice president and chief
scientific officer, and John Stuelpnagel, our senior vice
president and chief operating officer. The loss of their
services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our
business objectives. In addition, Timothy Kish, our chief
financial officer, has informed us of his intention to resign in
the second quarter of 2005. Mr. Kish continues in his role
as chief financial officer, and we are currently conducting a
search for his successor. We will need to hire additional
qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology,
chemistry, biological information processing, sales, marketing
and technical support. We compete for qualified management and
scientific personnel with other life science companies,
universities and research institutions, particularly those
focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals,
particularly in the San Diego area, is intense, and the
turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain
management and scientific personnel would prevent us from
pursuing collaborations or developing our products or
technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional expertise in
specific industries and areas applicable to the products
developed through our technologies, including the life sciences
and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add new
personnel, including management, and develop the expertise of
existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
growth of our business.



We may encounter difficulties in integrating future
    acquisitions and that could adversely affect our
    business.

We have recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire CyVera
Corporation and may in the future acquire technology, products
or businesses related to our current or future business. Our
acquisition of CyVera is expected to close in March 2005;
however, the closing is subject to satisfaction of customary
closing conditions, and we cannot assure you this transaction
will close in this timeframe or at all. We have limited
experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote
substantial time and resources in order to complete
acquisitions. Further, these potential acquisitions entail
risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business.
For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate a
company’s operations, technologies, products and services,
information systems and personnel into our business. An
acquisition may further strain our existing financial and
managerial controls, and divert management’s attention away
from our other business concerns. In connection with the CyVera
acquisition, we will assume certain liabilities and hire certain
employees of CyVera, which is expected to result in an increase
in research and development expenses. There may also be
unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an
acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results.

A significant portion of our sales are to international
    customers.

Approximately 52% of our revenues for the year ended
January 2, 2005 were derived from customers outside the
United States. We intend to continue to expand our international
presence and export sales to international customers and we
expect the total amount of non-U.S. sales to continue to
grow. Export sales entail a variety of risks, including:

In addition, sales to international customers typically result
in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts
receivable collection. We are also subject to general
geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic
instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. One
or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and operating results.

Our success depends upon the increasing availability of
    genetic information and the continued emergence and growth of
    markets for analysis of genetic variation and function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our
technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data
and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are
initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation
and function, namely SNP genotyping and gene expression
profiling. Both of these markets are new and emerging, and they
may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full
potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and
function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing.
Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic
data into medically valuable information through the analysis of
genetic variation and function. If useful genetic data is not
available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely
manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than
we expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain
profitability.



We expect that our results of operations will fluctuate.
    This fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline.

Our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
sales of high-value products and services projects, the impact
of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and amount of
government grant funding programs, the timing and size of
research projects our customers perform, changes in overall
spending levels in the life sciences industry and other
unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering
patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and
magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may
experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting
in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.
A large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including
expenses for facilities, equipment and personnel. In addition,
we expect operating expenses to continue to increase
significantly. Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as
anticipated, we may not be able to reduce our operating losses.
Approximately 30% of our revenues for the year 2004 resulted
from transactions that were funded under the International
HapMap Project. We currently expect that most of the activities
under this grant involving the Company and its customers will be
completed in early 2005. Although we expect that the loss of
revenues resulting from the completion of the HapMap grant may
be offset by the planned commercial launch of our whole genome
genotyping and gene expression arrays, combined with the
continued expansion of our existing product lines, any
significant delays in the commercial launch of these products,
unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or
impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely
affect our revenue growth in 2005 or cause a sequential decline
in quarterly revenues. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in
our revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons
of our operating results are not a good indication of our future
performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet
the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our
stock price probably would decline.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market
value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by
fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating
rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest
rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate
derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
changes. We ensure the safety and preservation of our invested
principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and
reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in
investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a
relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio,
and a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest
rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not
materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive
financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Although most of our revenue is realized in U.S. dollars,
some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies.
As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak
economic conditions in foreign markets. The functional
currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local
currencies. Accordingly, the accounts of these operations are
translated from the local currency to the U.S. dollar using
the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date
for the balance sheet accounts, and using the average exchange
rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. The
effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders
equity.



Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated
in foreign currencies are recorded in operations. In July 2004,
we began hedging significant foreign currency firm sales
commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts. We
only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign
currency exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our
forward exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow
hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized
gains or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are
reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and
losses for the effective portion are recognized with the
underlying hedge transaction. The notional settlement amount of
the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at
January 2, 2005 was approximately $4.0 million. These
contracts had a fair value of approximately $0.2 million,
representing an unrealized loss, and were included in other
current liabilities at January 2, 2005. As of
January 2, 2005, all contracts were set to expire at
various times through July 29, 2005 and are with reputable
bank institutions. For the year ended January 2, 2005,
there were no amounts recognized in earnings due to hedge
ineffectiveness and we settled foreign exchange contracts of
approximately $0.3 million. We have hedged all significant
firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies, and as a
result, any increase or decrease in the exchange rates of these
commitments would have no net effect to our balance sheet or our
results of operations.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

We have established and maintain disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that we record, process, summarize, and
report information we are required to disclose in our periodic
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
manner and within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. We also design our disclosure controls to
ensure that the information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including the chief executive officer and the
chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. We also maintain
internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with
applicable laws and our established financial policies. We
design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
(2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
recorded and reported in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.



We have evaluated the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures to determine whether they are effective
in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is
timely made in accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This
evaluation was made under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer as of January 2, 2005.
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or
our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be
faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of
any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected.

The chief executive officer and chief financial officer have
concluded, based on their review, that our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e), are effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms. In addition, no change in our internal control
over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting has occurred during the fourth quarter
of 2004.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

our
management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 2, 2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2,
2005 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in their report
which is included on page F-3 herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Illumina, Inc. as of January 2, 2005 and December 28,
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended
January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002. Our audits also include the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Illumina, Inc. at January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years ended January 2, 2005,
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Illumina, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Illumina Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Illumina, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January 2, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2,
2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of
January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for the years ended January 2, 2005,
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 of Illumina,
Inc. and our report dated February 16, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Organization and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on
April 28, 1998. The Company develops and markets
next-generation tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic
variation and function. Using the Company’s technologies,
it has developed a comprehensive line of products that are
designed to provide the throughput, cost effectiveness and
flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences
and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests
necessary to extract medically valuable information from
advances in genomics. This information is expected to correlate
genetic variation and gene function with particular disease
states, enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to be
detected earlier and more specifically, and permitting better
choices of drugs for individual patients.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
June 30, and September 30. The years ended
January 2, 2005 and December  28, 2003 are 53 and
52 weeks, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid
investments with a remaining maturity of less than three months
from the date of purchase.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

to its
investments. Under SFAS No. 115, the Company
classifies its investments as “Available-for-Sale” and
records such assets at estimated fair value in the balance
sheet, with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported in
stockholders’ equity. The Company invests its excess cash
balances in marketable debt securities, primarily government
securities and corporate bonds and notes, with strong credit
ratings or short maturity mutual funds providing similar
financial returns. The Company limits the amount of investment
exposure as to institutions, maturity and investment type. The
cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific
identification method. Gross realized gains totaled $453,750,
$342,693 and $810,201 for the years ended January 2, 2005,
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.
Gross realized losses totaled $891, $141 and $27,467 for the
years ended January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003, and
December 29, 2002, respectively.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Cash and Investments

At January 2, 2005, restricted cash and investments consist
of corporate debt securities that are used as collateral against
a letter of credit and a $100,000 bond deposit with the
San Diego Superior Court related to the Applied Biosystems
litigation (see Note 7). At December 28, 2003, the
restricted investments used as collateral against the letter of
credit were classified as long term.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial
instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate fair value. The Company enters into foreign currency
exchange forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign
currency exchange fluctuations and accounts for these
derivatives in accordance with SFAS 133,

Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

as described
more fully in Note 3.

Accounts and Notes Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net invoice value and
notes receivable are recorded at contractual value plus earned
interest. Interest income on notes receivable is recognized
according to the terms of each related agreement. The Company
considers receivables past due based on the contractual payment
terms. The Company reviews its exposure to amounts receivable
and reserves specific amounts if collectibility is no longer
reasonably assured. The Company also reserves a percentage of
the net trade receivable balance based on collection history.
The Company re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and
adjusts its reserves as needed.

Concentrations of Risk

Cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable are
financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk. Most of the Company’s cash
and cash equivalents as of January 2, 2005 are deposited
with financial institutions in the United States and Company
policy restricts the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer
and to any one type of investment, other than securities issued
by the U.S. Government. The Company has historically not
experienced significant credit losses from accounts receivable.
The Company performs a regular review of customer activity and
associated credit risks and generally does not require
collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts
receivable.

The Company’s products require customized components that
currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
Company obtains certain key components included in its products
from single vendors. No assurance can be given that these or
other product components will be available in sufficient
quantities at acceptable costs in the future.

Approximately 52% of the Company’s revenues for the year
ended January 2, 2005 were derived from customers outside
the United States. International sales entail a variety of
risks, including currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment
cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection.
The Company is also subject to general geopolitical risks, such
as political, social and economic instability and changes in
diplomatic and trade relations. The risks of international sales
are mitigated in part by the extent to which sales are
geographically distributed and the Company’s foreign
currency hedging program.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which
approximates actual cost) or market. Inventory includes raw
materials and finished goods that may be used in the research
and development process and such items are expensed as consumed.
Provisions for slow moving, excess and obsolete inventories are
provided based on product life cycle and development plans,
product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and
inventory levels.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
the assets (generally three to seven years for equipment) using
the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the related assets.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of license agreements and acquired
technology. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 17,

Accounting for
Intangible Assets,

intangible assets are recorded at cost.
The rights related to one of the license agreements are
amortized over its estimated useful life (five years) and will
be fully amortized in fiscal year 2008. The rights related to
other license agreements are amortized based on sales of related
product and are expected to be fully amortized by the end of
fiscal 2005. The cost of these license agreements was $844,450
and the Company has amortized $493,333 through January 2,
2005. Amortization expense related to license agreements for the
years ending January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002 was $300,000, $185,000 and $8,333,
respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

if indicators
of impairment exist, the Company annually assesses the
recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment
is indicated, the Company measures the future discounted cash
flows associated with the use of the asset and adjusts the value
of the asset accordingly. While the Company’s current and
historical operating and cash flow losses are indicators of
impairment, the Company believes the future cash flows to be
received from the long-lived assets recorded at January 2,
2005 will exceed the assets’ carrying value, and
accordingly the Company has not recognized any impairment losses
through January 2, 2005.

Reserve for Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one year warranty on genotyping
and gene expression systems. At the time revenue is recognized,
the Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty
expenses associated with system sales. This expense is recorded
as a component of cost of revenue.

F-10


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenue in accordance with the guidelines
established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
(“SAB 104”). Under SAB 104, revenue cannot
be recorded until all the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered; the seller’s price to the
buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably
assured. Product revenue consists of sales of oligonucleotides,
arrays, assay reagents, genotyping systems and gene expression
systems. Service revenue consists of revenue received for
performing SNP genotyping services and for extended warranty
sales.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
reasonably assured. BeadLab revenue is recognized when earned,
which is generally upon shipment, installation, training and
fulfillment of contractually defined acceptance criteria.
Reserves are provided for anticipated product warranty expenses
at the time the associated revenue is recognized. Revenue for
extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
the extended warranty. Revenue for genotyping services is
recognized generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is
delivered to the customer. The Company has been awarded
$9.1 million from the National Institutes of Health to
perform genotyping services in connection with the first phase
of the International HapMap Project. A portion of the revenue
from this project is earned at the time the related costs are
incurred while the remainder of the revenue is earned upon the
delivery of genotyping data. Research revenue consists of
amounts earned under research agreements with government grants,
which is recognized in the period during which the related costs
are incurred. Some contracts entered into by the Company qualify
as multiple element arrangements as defined by Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-21 (“EITF 00-21”),

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.”

The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when
the delivered element has stand-alone value, the fair values of
undelivered elements are known, and there are no uncertainties
regarding customer acceptance. All revenues are recognized net
of applicable allowances for returns or discounts.

Shipping and Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
revenue and totaled $180,208, $143,423 and $45,809 for the years
ended January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively.

Research and Development

Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed
in the period incurred.

Software Development Costs

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,

to capitalize costs
related to marketed software. To date, the Company has only
marketed software that is an incidental component to its SNP
genotyping and gene expression systems. Accordingly, the Company
capitalizes software costs that are incurred after the later of
1) the establishment of technological feasibility of the
software or 2) the completion of all research and
development activities for the other components of the product.
Through January 2, 2005, the period between achieving
either of these milestones and the general release date of the
products has been very brief and software development costs
thereafter were not significant. Accordingly, the Company has
not capitalized any qualifying software development costs in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The costs of
developing routine enhancements are expensed as research and
development costs as incurred because of the short time between
the determination of technological feasibility and the date of
general release of the related products.

The Company applies Statement of Position (“SOP”)
No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.

For the years ended
January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, the Company
capitalized $26,650 and $93,693, respectively, in costs incurred
to acquire and develop software associated with the
implementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning and
Laboratory Information Management systems. These costs are
amortized over the estimated useful life of the software of
seven years, beginning when the software is ready for its
intended use.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
costs were $792,508, $439,710 and $267,338 for the years ended
January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, respectively.

Income Taxes

A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the
expected future impact of differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as
the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense is generally
the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset
or liability. Valuation allowances are established when
realizability of deferred tax assets is uncertain. The effect of
tax rate changes is reflected in tax expense during the period
in which such changes are enacted.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of the Company’s wholly owned
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. Accordingly,
all balance sheet accounts of these operations are translated to
U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated
using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these
subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded directly as
a separate component of stockholders’ equity under the
caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Stock-Based Compensation

At January 2, 2005, the Company has three stock-based
employee and non-employee director compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note 6. As permitted by
SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

the Company accounts for common stock options
granted, and restricted stock sold, to employees, founders and
directors using the intrinsic value method and, thus, recognizes
no compensation expense for options granted, or restricted stock
sold, with exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair
value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the
grant. The Company has recorded deferred stock compensation
related to certain stock options, and restricted stock, which
were granted prior to the Company’s initial public offering
with exercise prices below estimated fair value (see
Note 6), which is being amortized on an accelerated
amortization methodology in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 28.

Pro forma information regarding net loss is required by
SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company
had accounted for its employee stock options and employee stock
purchases under the fair value method of that statement. The
fair value for these options was estimated at the dates of grant
using the fair value option pricing model (Black Scholes) with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 2004, 2003 and
2002:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share Based Payment

(SFAS 123R), which is a revision
of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(SFAS 123). This statement supercedes APB
Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(APB 25), and amends FASB Statement No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows.

Generally, the approach in
SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in
SFAS 123; however, SFAS 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.

SFAS 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using
either a “modified prospective” method or a
“modified retrospective” method. Under the
“modified prospective” method, compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on
the requirements for SFAS 123 for all unvested awards
granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. Under the
“modified retrospective” method, the requirements are
the same as under the “modified prospective” method,
but also permits companies to restate financial statements of
previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in
accordance with SFAS 123. The Company currently utilizes
the Black-Scholes model to measure the fair value of stock
options granted to employees under the pro forma disclosure
requirements if FAS 123. While SFAS 123R permits
companies to continue to use such model, it also permits the use
of a “lattice” model. The Company has not yet
determined which method or model it will use to measure the fair
value of employee stock options under the adoption for
SFAS 123R. The new standard is effective for periods
beginning after June 15, 2005, and the Company expects to
adopt SFAS 123R on July 4, 2005.

The Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB 25’s intrinsic value method and,
as such, recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock
options granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than
the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
the grant. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123R’s
fair value method is expected to result in significant non-cash
charges which will increase the Company’s reported
operating expenses, however, it will have no impact on its cash
flows. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be
predicted at this time because it will depend on the level of
share-based payments granted in the future and the model the
Company chooses to use. However, had the Company adopted
SFAS 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard
would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described
in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings above.

Deferred compensation for options granted, and restricted stock
sold, to consultants has been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18 as
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value
of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measured. Deferred charges for options granted, and restricted
stock sold, to consultants are periodically remeasured as the
underlying options vest.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other
comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss includes unrealized
gains and losses on the Company’s available-for-sale
securities, changes in the fair value of derivatives designated
as effective as cash flow hedges, and foreign currency
translation adjustments. The Company has disclosed comprehensive
loss as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Net Loss per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share are presented in
conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share,

for all periods presented. In accordance with
SFAS No. 128, basic and net loss per share is computed
using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period, less shares subject to
repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is typically computed
using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares from stock options using the treasury stock
method. However, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per
share is the same as basic net loss per share because the
Company reported a net loss and therefore the inclusion of
weighted average shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of stock options would be antidilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,

requires that all derivatives be
recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in
current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on
whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge
transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. We
assess, both at its inception and on an on-going basis, whether
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged
items. We also assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis
and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion
to current earnings to the extent significant.

The Company has a foreign exchange hedging program principally
designed to mitigate the potential impact due to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold any
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. The Company primarily uses forward exchange contracts
to hedge foreign currency exposures and they generally have
terms of one year or less. These contracts have been designated
as cash flow hedges and accordingly, to the extent effective,
any unrealized gains or losses on these foreign currency forward
contracts are reported in other comprehensive income. Realized
gains and losses for the effective portion are recognized with
the underlying hedge transaction. The notional settlement amount
of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at
January 2, 2005 was approximately $4.0 million. These
contracts had a fair value of approximately $249,443 and were
included in other current liabilities at January 2, 2005.

For the year ended January 2, 2005, there were no amounts
recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness and we
settled foreign exchange contracts of $283,721. The Company did
not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to fiscal
2004.

Warranties and Maintenance Contracts

The Company generally provides a one year warranty on genotyping
and gene expression systems. At the time revenue is recognized,
the Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty
expenses associated with system sales. This expense is recorded
as a component of cost of product revenue. Estimated warranty
expenses associated with extended maintenance contracts are
recorded as cost of revenue ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract.

Commitments and Long-term Debt

Building Loan

In July 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year lease to rent
space in two newly constructed buildings in San Diego that
are now occupied by the Company. That lease contained an option
to purchase the buildings together with certain adjacent land
that has been approved for construction of an additional
building. The Company exercised that option and purchased the
properties in January 2002 and assumed a $26 million,
10-year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of
8.36%. The Company made monthly payments of $208,974,
representing interest and principal, through August 2004.
Interest expense was $1.4 million, $2.2 million and
$2.3 million for the years ended January 2, 2005,
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.

In June, 2004, the Company entered into a conditional agreement
to sell its land and buildings for $42.0 million and to
lease back such property for an initial term of ten years. The
sale was completed in August 2004 at which time the lease was
signed. After the repayment of the remaining $25.2 million
debt and other related transaction expenses, the Company
received $15.5 million in net cash proceeds. The Company
removed the land and net book value of the buildings of
$36.9 million from its balance sheet, deferred the
resulting $3.7 million gain on the sale of the property,
and is amortizing the deferred gain over the ten year lease term
in accordance with SFAS 13,

Accounting for Leases.

The Company leased a portion of the space to a tenant under a

1,500,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined by the
Company’s board of directors.

the grant of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, stock
bonuses and rights to purchase stock to employees, directors or
consultants of the Company. The Plan provided that incentive
stock options to be granted only to employees at no less than
the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as determined
by the board of directors at the date of the grant. Options
generally vest 20% one year from the date of grant and ratably
each month thereafter for a period of 48 months and expire
ten years from date of grant. In December 1999, the Company
modified the plan to allow for acceleration of vesting in the
event of an acquisition or merger.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“Purchase Plan”). A total of 2,445,547 shares of
the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only
through payroll deductions, during defined offering periods. The
price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is
equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
The initial offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition,
the Purchase Plan provides for annual increases of shares
available for issuance under the Purchase Plan beginning with
fiscal 2001. 585,855, 304,714 and 128,721 shares were
issued under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Deferred Stock Compensation

Since the inception of the Company, in connection with the grant
of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to
employees, founders and directors through July 25, 2000,
the Company has recorded deferred stock compensation totaling
approximately $17.6 million, representing the difference
between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of the
Company’s common stock as estimated by the Company’s
management for financial reporting purposes on the date such
stock options were granted or restricted common stock was sold.
Deferred compensation is included as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity and is being amortized to expense over
the vesting period of the options and restricted stock. During
the years ended January 2, 2005, December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, the Company recorded amortization of
deferred stock compensation expense of approximately
$0.8 million, $2.5 million and $4.4 million,
respectively.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
“Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock of
the Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 (the
“Record Date”) to the stockholders of record on that
date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
the Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of
its Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a
price of $100 per unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a
person or group hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15%
or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company or
announces an offer for 15% or more of the outstanding common
stock. If a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
outstanding common stock of the Company, each Right will entitle
its holder to purchase, at the exercise price of the right, a
number of shares of common stock having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the right. If the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
after a person acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common
stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of common
shares of the acquiring company which at the time of such
transaction have a market value of two times the exercise price
of the right. The Board of Directors will be entitled to redeem
the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right at any time before
any such person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
the outstanding common stock. The rights expire on May 14,
2011 unless such date is extended or the rights are earlier
redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

Legal Proceedings

The Company has incurred substantial costs in defending itself
against patent infringement claims, and expects to devote
substantial financial and managerial resources to protect its
intellectual property and to defend against the claims described
below as well as any future claims asserted against it.

Termination-of-Employment Lawsuit

In June 2002, the Company recorded a $7.7 million charge to
cover total damages and estimated expenses awarded by a jury
related to a termination-of-employment lawsuit. The Company
appealed the decision, and in December 2004, the Fourth
Appellate District Court of Appeal, in San Diego,
California, reduced the amount of the award. The Company
recorded interest expense during the appeal based on the
statutory rate. For the years ended January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003, the Company recorded litigation expense
of $567,000 and $756,000, respectively, for interest. As a
result of the revised judgment, the Company reduced the
$9.2 million liability recorded on its balance sheet to
$5.9 million and recorded a gain of $3.3 million as a
litigation judgment in the statement of operations for the year
ended January  2, 2005.

As a result of the Company’s decision to appeal the ruling,
the Company filed a surety bond with the court equal to 1.5
times the judgment amount or approximately $11.3 million.
Under the terms of the bond, the Company is required to maintain
a letter of credit for 90% of the bond amount to secure the
bond. Further, the Company was required to deposit approximately
$12.5 million of marketable securities as collateral for
the letter of credit and accordingly, these funds were
restricted from use for general corporate purposes until the
appeal process was completed. A judgment was rendered in
December 2004 and payment was made in early 2005 at which time
the restricted funds, recorded as restricted investments, were
released.

Litigation with Applera Corporation’s Applied
    Biosystems Group

In November 1999, the Company entered into a joint development
agreement with Applied Biosystems Group (“Applied
Biosystems”), an operating group of Applera Corporation
(“Applera”), under which the companies would jointly
develop a SNP genotyping system that would combine the
Company’s BeadArray technology with Applied
Biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology. In
conjunction with the agreement, Applied Biosystems agreed to
provide the Company with non-refundable research and development
support of $10.0 million, all of which was provided by
December 2001. As of December 28, 2003 this amount was
recorded as a liability on the Company’s balance sheet.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems initiated a patent
infringement suit and sought to compel arbitration of an alleged
breach of the joint development agreement. In December 2002, the
Company filed a suit alleging breach of contract, breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair
competition and other allegations against Applied Biosystems in
San Diego Superior Court, and moved to prevent the
arbitration of the joint development agreement sought by Applied
Biosystems. In January 2004, the Company notified Applied
Biosystems that it was terminating the joint development
agreement.

In August 2004, the Company and Applera entered into a
settlement and cross-license agreement. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company paid Applera a one-time payment of
$8.5 million. The settlement agreement also provided for an
exchange of royalty-free cross-licenses to certain intellectual
property rights, termination of the joint development agreement,
dismissal of the federal patent infringement action brought by
Applied Biosystems, termination of the arbitration proceeding,
and dismissal of the Company’s state court action against
Applied Biosystems.

As a result of the settlement, the Company removed the
$10.0 million liability from its balance sheet, made a
payment of $8.5 million to Applera and recorded a gain of
$1.5 million as a litigation settlement in the statement of
operations for the year ended January 2, 2005.

Affymetrix Litigation

In July 2004, Affymetrix, Inc. (“Affymetrix”) filed a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware alleging that certain of the Company’s products
infringe six Affymetrix patents. The suit seeks an unspecified
amount of monetary damages and a judgment enjoining the sale of
products, if any, that are determined to be infringing these
patents. In September 2004, the Company filed its answer and
counterclaims to Affymetrix’ complaint, seeking declaratory
judgments from the court that it does not infringe the
Affymetrix patents, and that such patents are invalid, and filed
counterclaims against Affymetrix for unfair competition and
interference with actual and prospective economic advantage. The
Company believes it has meritorious defenses against each of the
infringement claims alleged by Affymetrix and intends to
vigorously defend itself against this suit. However, the Company
cannot be sure it will prevail in this matter. Any unfavorable
determination, and in particular, any significant cash amounts
required to be paid by the Company or prohibition of the sale of
the Company’s products and services, could result in a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations. While the parties have pending motions
before the court, no trial date has yet been set for this case.

Collaborative Agreements

International HapMap Project

The Company is the recipient of a grant from the National
Institutes of Health covering its participation in the first
phase of the International HapMap Project, which is a
$100 million, internationally funded successor project to
the Human Genome Project that will help identify a map of
genetic variations that may be used to perform disease-related
research. The Company could receive up to $9.1 million of
funding for this project which covers basic research activities,
the development of SNP assays and the genotyping to be performed
on those assays. As of January 2, 2005, the Company had
approximately $0.7 million of funding remaining related to
this project which is expected to be received in early 2005.

Invitrogen Corporation

In December 2004, the Company entered into a strategic
collaboration with Invitrogen Corporation. The collaboration is
expected to expand the Company’s Oligator DNA synthesis
technology and combine that capability with Invitrogen’s
sales, marketing and distribution channels. Under the terms of
the agreement, Invitrogen has agreed to pay the Company up to
$3.4 million, which the Company plans to invest in its
San Diego facility to enable implementation of
fourth-generation Oligator technology and extend the technology
into tube-based oligo products. In addition, the agreement
provides for the transfer of the Company’s Oligator
technology into two Invitrogen facilities outside North America.
Profit from the sale of collaboration products will be divided
equally between the two companies.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes for the years
ended January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003 consisted
of $135,000 of income tax expense related to its foreign
operations. This expense is included with interest and other
expense in the statement of operations.

At January 2, 2005, the Company has federal and state tax
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$86.5 million and $39.1 million, respectively. The
federal and state tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in
fiscal year 2018 and 2006 respectively, unless previously
utilized. The Company also has federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$3.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, which
will begin to expire in fiscal year 2018, unless previously
utilized.

Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
Code, annual use of the Company’s net operating loss and
credit carryforwards may be limited in the event of a cumulative
ownership change of more than 50 percentage points within a
three-year period.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets

shown below (in thousands). A valuation allowance has been
established as of January 2, 2005 and December 28,

threshold required under FAS 109.

Deferred tax assets of approximately $0.4 million and
$0.2 million at January 2, 2005 and December 28,
2003, respectively, resulted from the exercise of employee stock
options. When recognized, the tax benefit of these assets will

On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a
number of limitations and, as of today, uncertainty remains as
to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. Based on our
analysis of the Act, although not yet finalized, it is possible
that under the repatriation provision of the Act we may
repatriate some amount of our undistributed foreign earnings. We
expect to finalize our assessment in 2005.
