Overview

We are a leading developer of next-generation
tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Understanding genetic variation and function is
critical to the development of personalized medicine, a key goal
of genomics. Our tools provide information that could be used to
improve drugs and therapies, customize diagnoses and treatment,
and cure disease.

Completion of the sequencing of the human genome
will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in
processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw
genetic data into medically valuable information. This requires
functional analysis of highly complex biological systems,
involving a scale of experimentation not practical using
currently available tools and technologies. Using our
technologies, we have developed a comprehensive line of products
that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of
functional analysis required to help achieve the goals of
molecular medicine.

Our patented BeadArray technology uses
microscopic beads randomly deposited in wells to achieve a level
of miniaturization that allows for a new scale of
experimentation. A microarray is a collection of miniaturized
test sites arranged on a surface that permits many tests, or
assays, to be performed in parallel. Our arrays allow
simultaneous processing of many samples in parallel, achieving
throughput we believe to be significantly beyond the capability
of any other technology currently on the market. We assemble our
arrays using relatively inexpensive materials. Our proprietary
manufacturing process allows us to easily adapt the arrays to a
broad range of applications, including both genotyping and gene
expression. These characteristics allow us to create
next-generation arrays with a unique combination of high
throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility. In addition, our
complemen-



tary Oligator technology permits parallel
synthesis of the millions of different pieces of DNA necessary
to perform large-scale genetic analysis on arrays.

We provide both products and services that
utilize our proprietary technologies. During 2001, we launched
our commercial genotyping service product line which combines
our BeadArray technology with an automated, laboratory
information management system, or LIMS, controlled process to
provide high throughput identification of the most common form
of genetic variation, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms,
or SNPs. We also began the sale of custom synthesized pieces of
DNA called oligonucleotides, or oligos using our proprietary
Oligator technology.

In the third quarter of 2002, we announced the
launch of our production scale BeadLab genotyping system. This
integrated turnkey system is built around our proprietary
BeadArray technology. Included in the system are the BeadArray
Reader, GoldenGate assay protocols, LIMS and analytical
software, fluid-handling robotics, and access to Sentrix arrays
and reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences. Our Sentrix
array is a collection of individual arrays arranged in a pattern
compatible with standard microtiter plates, our reagent kit uses
highly multiplexed GoldenGate assay protocols which allow up to
1536 SNPs to be analyzed at one time in a sample and our
BeadArray Reader is a proprietary scanner used to read the
results of the experiments captured on our arrays. Our
genotyping system is based on the production laboratory that has
been operational in our genotyping service product line since
2001. When installed, the BeadLab genotyping system is able to
routinely produce up to 1.4 million genotypes per day. As
of the end of February 2004, we have installed six BeadLab
genotyping systems.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we were named the
largest U.S. participant in the $100 million
International HapMap Project funded by the National Institutes
of Health. This project is an internationally funded successor
project to the Human Genome Project that will help identify a
map of genetic variations that may be used to perform
disease-related research. This map of the human genome will
allow more rapid and efficient large-scale genetic association
studies aimed at discovering variants contributing to human
disease and differential response to drug treatments. We are one
of five funded U.S. participants in a worldwide initiative
that includes research groups in Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria
and the United Kingdom. We will be directly responsible for
screening over 15% of the assays in the project. This effort
leverages our Oligator DNA synthesis capability and the
production-scale throughput of our genotyping services
operation. Our BeadLab system is being used by organizations
responsible for creating over 60% of the assays in this project.

In the first quarter of 2003, we completed the
installation of and recorded revenue for our first BeadLab
high-throughput SNP genotyping system. We installed and recorded
revenue for a second BeadLab in the second quarter of 2003, two
additional BeadLabs in the third quarter of 2003 and a fifth and
sixth BeadLab system in the fourth quarter of 2003.

In the second quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a new microarray format, the Sentrix BeadChip, which
is expected to significantly expand market opportunities for our
BeadArray technology and provide increased experimental
flexibility for life science researchers.

In the third quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a gene expression product line on both the Sentrix
Array Matrix and the Sentrix BeadChip that will allow
researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96
samples on a single microarray.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a benchtop SNP genotyping system, the BeadStation, for
performing medium scale genotyping using our technology. The
BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader, genotyping analysis
software and GoldenGate assay reagents and is designed to match
the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of
individual research groups and core labs. This system is
expected to be available for shipment in the second quarter of
2004.

In the first quarter of 2004, we announced the
launch of two new Sentrix BeadChips for whole-genome gene
expression. These BeadChips are designed to enable
high-performance, cost-effective,



whole-genome expression profiling of multiple
samples on a single chip, resulting in a dramatic reduction in
cost of whole-genome expression analysis while allowing
researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of
large-scale biological experimentation.

We are seeking to expand our customer base for
our BeadArray technology; however, we can give no assurance that
our sales efforts will continue to be successful.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998.
We reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal
executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive,
San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is

Industry Background

Genetic Variation and
    Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene,
one from each parent. The two copies of each gene may be
identical, or they may be different. These differences are
referred to as genetic variation. Examples of the physical
consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and
hair color. Genetic variation can also have important medical
consequences, including predisposition to disease and
differential response to drugs. Genetic variation affects
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
cause people to respond differently to the same drug. Some
people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
still others may experience adverse side effects. The most
common form of genetic variation is a Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism, or SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position
in a DNA sequence. It is estimated that the human genome
contains between three and six million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be
responsible for medically important effects, it is now believed
that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result
of the interaction of many SNPs. Therefore, it will be important
to investigate many SNPs together in order to discover medically
valuable information.

Current efforts to understand genetic variation
and function have primarily centered around SNP genotyping and
gene expression profiling.

SNP Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining
which SNPs are present in each of the two copies of a gene, or
other portion of DNA sequence, within an individual or other
organism. The use of SNP genotyping to obtain meaningful
statistics on the effect of an individual SNP or a collection of
SNPs, and to apply that information to clinical trials and
diagnostic testing, will require the analysis of millions of SNP
genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease.
For example, a single large clinical trial could involve
genotyping 200,000 SNPs per patient in 1,000 patients, thus
requiring 200 million assays. Using available technologies,
this scale of SNP genotyping is both impractical and
prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping will be used for a
variety of applications, including genomics-based drug
development, clinical trial analysis, disease predisposition
testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping can also be used
outside of healthcare, for example in the development of plants
and animals with desirable commercial characteristics. These
markets will require billions of SNP genotyping assays annually.

Gene Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of
determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group
of cells and is accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary
between genes and proteins. Variation in gene expression can
cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease or
predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression patterns
between cells from different



environments, such as normal tissue compared to
diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug,
specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these
processes can be identified. Studies of this type, used in drug
discovery, require monitoring thousands, and preferably tens of
thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of samples. Once a smaller
set of genes of interest has been identified, researchers can
then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across
numerous samples, for example, within a clinical trial. The high
cost of current gene expression methods has limited the
development of the gene expression market.

Once gene expression patterns have been
correlated to specific diseases, gene expression profiling is
expected to become an important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use
of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly
with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and
the availability of more cost-effective technologies.

Our Technologies

BeadArray Technology

We have developed a proprietary array technology
that enables the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads
and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to
produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our
BeadArray technology provides a unique combination of high
throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We achieve high
throughput with a high density of test sites per array and our
ability to format arrays in either a pattern arranged to match
the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various
configurations in the format of standard microscope slides. We
maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive
reagents and valuable samples, and from the low manufacturing
costs associated with our complementary technologies. Our
ability to vary the size, shape and format of the well patterns
and to create specific bead pools, or sensors, for different
applications provides the flexibility to address multiple
markets and market segments. We believe that these features will
enable our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform for
the emerging high-growth markets of SNP genotyping and gene
expression.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines
microwells etched into a substrate and specially prepared beads
that self-assemble into an array. We have deployed our BeadArray
technology in two different formats, the Array Matrix and the
BeadChip. Our first bead-based product was the Array Matrix
which incorporates fiber optic bundles. We have the fiber optic
bundles manufactured to our specifications, which we cut into
lengths of less than one inch. Each bundle contains
approximately 50,000 individual fibers and 96 of these bundles
are placed into an aluminum plate, which forms an Array Matrix.
BeadChips are fabricated in microscope slide-shaped sizes with
varying numbers of sample sites per slide. Both formats are
chemically etched to create tens of thousands of wells for each
sample site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by
affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of
microscopic beads in a batch. We make different batches of
beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with one
particular type of molecule. The particular molecules on a bead
define that bead’s function as a sensor. For example, we
create a batch of SNP sensors by attaching a particular DNA
sequence to each bead in the batch. We combine batches of coated
beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to
create. A bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient
beads to produce thousands of arrays. One of the advantages of
this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays
for SNP genotyping. All of our SNP genotyping arrays are
manufactured with the same set of sensors. This allows us to
manufacture one type of genotyping array, and by varying the
reagent kit, still be able to use it to test for any combination
of SNPs.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is
brought into contact with the array surface where they are
randomly drawn into the wells, one bead per well. The tens of
thousands of beads in the wells comprise our BeadArray. Because
the beads assemble randomly into the wells, we perform a final
procedure called decoding in order to determine which bead type
occupies which well in the array. We



employ several proprietary methods for decoding,
a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the
beads in the array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding
process is a validation of each bead in the array. This quality
control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can
identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure that
each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by
having multiple copies of each bead type. This improves the
reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing
statistical processing of the results of identical beads.

One performs an experiment on the BeadArray
matrices by preparing a sample, such as DNA from a patient, and
introducing it to the array. The design features of our Array
Matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing
the sample, whereas our BeadChip allows processing of samples on
a slide. The molecules in the sample bind to their matching
molecules on the coated bead. The BeadArray Reader detects the
matched molecules by shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle
or on the BeadChip. Since the molecules in the sample have a
structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser,
detection of a binding event is possible. This allows the
measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated
bead, resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample.

Oligator Technology

Genomic applications require many different short
pieces of DNA that can be made synthetically, called
oligonucleotides. For example, SNP genotyping typically requires
three to four different oligonucleotides per assay. A SNP
genotyping experiment analyzing 10,000 SNPs may therefore
require 30,000 to 40,000 different oligonucleotides,
contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment.

We have designed our proprietary Oligator
technology for the parallel synthesis of many different
oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of large-scale
genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology
is substantially more cost effective and provides higher
throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our synthesis
machines are computer controlled and utilize many robotic
processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the
manufacturing process. Each of these synthesizers can produce up
to 3072 oligos in parallel, using very small amounts of
material. We believe both of these attributes are substantial
improvements over other existing technologies.

Key Advantages of Our BeadArray and
    Oligator Technologies

We believe that our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies provide distinct advantages, in a variety of
applications, over competing technologies, by creating
cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the following
advantages:

High Throughput.

The
miniaturization of our BeadArray technology provides
significantly greater information content per unit area than any
other array known to us. To further increase throughput, we have
formatted our Arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of
standard microtiter plates, allowing throughput levels of up to
150,000 unique assays per microtiter plate, as well as the use
of laboratory robotics to speed process time. The
Oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to
manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to
support large-scale genomic applications.

Cost Effectiveness.

Our BeadArray products substantially reduce the cost of
experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process
and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by
advances in fiber optics, digital imaging and bead chemistry. In
addition, these products require smaller reagent volumes than
other array technologies, and therefore reduce reagent costs.
Our cost-effective Oligator technology further reduces reagent
costs, as well as the cost of coating beads.

Flexibility.

A wide
variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching
different molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and other
chemicals to beads. By using beads, we are able to take
advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of
sensors, which we assemble into arrays using the same
proprietary manufacturing process. In addition, we can have
fiber optic bundles and



BeadChips manufactured in multiple shapes and
sizes with wells organized in various arrangements to optimize
them for different markets and market segments. In combination,
the use of beads and etched wells provides the flexibility and
scalability for our BeadArray technology to be tailored to
perform many applications in many different market segments,
from drug discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology
allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and
quantities of oligonucleotides.

Quality.

The high
density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple
copies of each individual bead type. We measure the copies
simultaneously and combine them into one data point. This allows
us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population
of identical beads, which permits the statistical calculation of
a more reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally,
the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding
step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead
on every array, improving the overall quality of the data.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray platforms the
industry standard for products and services utilizing array
technologies. We plan to achieve this by:

Products and Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray
technology, the Sentrix Array Matrix, is a disposable matrix
with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches
the standard 96-well microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle
performs more than 1,500 unique assays. Therefore, one Sentrix
array can perform nearly 150,000 individual assays
simultaneously, more than any other array system known to us.
The BeadChip, introduced in 2003, is fabricated in multiple
configurations to support multiple applications and scanning
technologies.

We have provided genotyping services using our
proprietary BeadArray technology since 2001. In addition, we
have developed our first genotyping and gene expression products
based on this technology. These products include disposable
Sentrix Arrays and BeadChips, GoldenGate reagent kits for SNP
genotyping and BeadArray Reader scanning instruments.

SNP Genotyping

In 2001, we introduced the first commercial
application of our BeadArray technology by launching our SNP
genotyping services product line. Since this launch we have had
peak days in which we operated at two million genotypes per day
based on individual samples. To our knowledge, no other
genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput
while delivering such high accuracy and low cost.

We designed our first consumable BeadArray
product, the Sentrix Array Matrix, for SNP genotyping. The
Sentrix Array Matrix uses a universal format that allows it to
analyze any set of SNPs. We have also developed reagent kits
based on GoldenGate assay protocols and the BeadArray Reader, a
laser scanner, which is used to read our array products. These
components, combined with LIMS, standard operating procedures
and analytical software and fluid handling robotics comprise our
BeadLab SNP genotyping system. This production scale system was
commercialized in late 2002 and when installed, the genotyping
system can routinely produce up to 1.4 million genotypes
per day.



In January 2003, we announced the availability of
two assay sets, one for genetic linkage analysis and the other
for fine chromosomal or whole-genome mapping. These standard
products have been deployed in our genotyping services operation
and are also sold to customers who use our SNP genotyping
system. Genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal
regions with potential disease associations across a related set
of samples. Fine mapping provides dense genotyping and may
enable target gene identification related to a specific disease.

In November 2003, we announced the BeadStation, a
system for performing moderate scale genotyping designed to
match the throughput requirements of individual research groups
and core labs. The BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader,
genotyping analysis software and GoldenGate assay reagents and
will initially support a high-density version of our BeadChip.
The Sentrix BeadChip allows simultaneous processing of 16
samples and uses identical content as the Sentrix Array Matrix.

Gene Expression Profiling

In September 2003, we introduced our focused set
gene expression products on both the Sentrix Array Matrix and
Sentrix BeadChip platforms. For high-throughput projects, our
system includes a BeadArray Reader for imaging Sentrix Array
Matrices, a hybridization chamber and software for data
extraction. For research projects that require moderate
throughput, a version of the Sentrix BeadChip analyzes eight
samples in parallel and can be scanned on a portion of the
installed base of Axon Instruments’ GenePix

TM

scanners. In addition, we have developed standard gene
expression products for each of the human, mouse and arabidopsis
genomes.

In January 2004, we announced two whole-genome
gene expression BeadChip products. Both products allow
whole-genome expression profiling of multiple samples on a
single chip and are imaged using our BeadArray Reader. The first
BeadChip is designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome
samples on one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately
48,000 transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human
genome. The second BeadChip product analyzes eight samples in
parallel against the roughly 22,000 genes represented in the
consensus RefSeq database, a well-characterized whole-genome
subset used broadly in genetic analysis. We expect that the new
whole-genome gene expression BeadChips will dramatically reduce
the cost of whole-genome expression analysis, allowing
researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of
large-scale biological experimentation.

Scanning Instrumentation

We have developed the BeadArray Reader which is
an instrument that uses a laser to read the results of
experiments that are captured on our Sentrix Array Matrices and
BeadChips, and is part of both our production scale BeadLab SNP
genotyping laboratory and our benchtop BeadStation system. This
scanning equipment was designed to be used in all areas of
genetic analysis that use our Sentrix arrays.

High-Throughput Synthesis

We have put in place an oligonucleotide
manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of
producing approximately 20 million oligonucleotides per
year. In addition to their use to coat beads, these
oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our
BeadArray products and are used for assay development. Because
our production capacity exceeds our internal needs, we began to
offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in 2001. We
provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in
several scales, with the ability to add many types of
modifications. We offer a range of quality control options and
have implemented a laboratory information management system to
control much of the manufacturing process. In February 2003, we
introduced the first standard product offerings in our Oligator
product line, a whole-genome oligonucleotide reference set
designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays.
We believe our Oligator technology is more cost



effective than competing technologies, which has
allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price
leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross
margins.

Partnerships and Collaborations

In November 1999, we entered into a joint
development agreement with Applied Biosystems, a Division of
Applera Corporation, under which the companies would jointly
develop a SNP genotyping system that would combine our
BeadArray

TM

technology with Applied Biosystems’
assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under this agreement, we
were primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the
arrays and Applied Biosystems was responsible for developing and
manufacturing the instruments, SNP assay reagents and software
and for marketing the system worldwide. In conjunction with the
agreement, Applied Biosystems purchased 1.25 million shares
of Series C convertible preferred stock at $4.00 per
share. In addition, Applied Biosystems agreed to provide us with
non-refundable research and development support of
$10 million, all of which was provided by December 2001.
Upon commercialization of the system, we were to receive a share
of the operating profits from the sales of all components of
these systems, had such sales occurred.

In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. We do not believe that Applied Biosystems has
any intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product
with us. As a result of the delay in developing the
collaboration product, we launched our own production-scale
genotyping system in July 2002 utilizing our arrays and an
independently developed scanner and assay method. In December
2002, we announced that we had notified Applied Biosystems that
it was in breach of the joint development agreement. This
notification followed a patent infringement suit filed by
Applied Biosystems against us and a notification from Applied
Biosystems alleging that we had breached the joint development
agreement and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to the
agreement. In December 2003, we notified Applied Biosystems that
we had terminated the joint development agreement. For further
information regarding this matter, please see ITEM 3,
“Legal Proceedings” and ITEM 7,
“Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.” We do not have any
other significant partnerships or collaborations.

Research and Development

We have made substantial investments in research
and development since our inception. We have assembled a team of
skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
complete the development of our products. Our research and
development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies and to
support commercialization of the products and services derived
from these technologies. These efforts include among others:

•

We enhanced the quality and manufacturing yield
    of our Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips. We are exploring
    ways to continue to increase the level of automation in the
    manufacturing process to further reduce the time and cost of
    producing arrays. We currently have the infrastructure in place
    to manufacture Sentrix Array Matrices and BeadChips in
    sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external
    needs.

•

We introduced a number of initiatives in 2002 and
    2003 to improve the yield and quality of our oligonucleotides
    while reducing cost substantially. By refining our understanding
    of the design and operation of our Oligator technology, we have
    been able to make numerous changes in our process, which we
    believe provides us a more cost effective system than competing
    technologies. Our oligonucleotide manufacturing facility
    currently has the capability of producing approximately
    20 million oligonucleotides per year.



•

We have developed the BeadArray Reader, a laser
    scanning instrument that scans our Sentrix array platforms.
    Laser scanners provide the high sensitivity and resolution
    required to address the extremely dense geometries of our
    bead-based arrays. We made the first commercial shipments of our
    scanners in the first quarter of 2003 as part of our BeadLab
    system.

•

We completed development of and launched our gene
    expression product line on both array formats. We believe the
    combination of our gene expression products flexibility and
    low-per-sample cost will enable larger and more meaningful gene
    expression studies.

We have been exploring the underlying molecular
    biology and chemistry issues related to developing assays and
    performing experiments on our BeadArray platforms. By improving
    our processes and protocols, we have substantially increased the
    number of assays we can process simultaneously in a single
    sample on our arrays.

Our research and development expenses for the
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 (exclusive of charges relating
to stock based compensation of $1.3 million,
$2.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively) were
$22.5 million, $26.8 million and $20.7 million,
respectively. We expect research and development expense to
remain flat in 2004 as compared to 2003 but in general increase
in the future as we continue to expand our research and product
development efforts.

Government Grants

Government grants allow us to fund internal
scientific programs and exploratory research. We retain
ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights
generated during these projects, subject to a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, paid-up license to practice, for or on behalf
of the United States, inventions made with federal funds. This
license is retained by the U.S. government as provided by
applicable statutes and regulations. We do not believe that the
retained license will have any impact on our ability to market
our products, and we do not need government approval with
respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or
other relationships with third parties. We are the recipient of
a grant from the National Institutes of Health covering our
participation in the International HapMap Project, which is a
$100 million, internationally funded successor project to
the Human Genome Project that will help identify a map of
genetic variations that may be used to perform disease-related
research. We could receive up to $9 million of funding for
this project which covers basic research activities, the
development of SNP assays and the genotyping to be performed on
those assays. As of the end of 2003, we had approximately
$5.4 million of funding remaining related to this project,
much of which is expected to be received in 2004, depending on
the actual amount of work that is performed by us.

Intellectual Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including
ownership of, or exclusive licenses to, 27 issued
U.S. patents and 65 pending U.S. patent applications,
including four allowed applications that have not yet issued as
patents, some of which derive from a common parent application.
Our issued patents, which cover various aspects of our
BeadArray, oligonucleotide synthesis and chemical detection
technologies, expire between 2011 and 2020. We are seeking to
extend this patent protection on our BeadArray, GoldenGate,
Oligator, Sentrix and related technologies. We have received or
filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in
one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
copyright and trademark protection, as well as continuing
technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend
in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our
products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade
secrets, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of
third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling
technology or products used with our BeadArray, GoldenGate,
Sentrix and Oligator technologies.



We are party to various exclusive and
non-exclusive license agreements with third parties, which grant
us rights to use key aspects of our array technology, assay
methods, chemical detection methods, reagent kits and scanning
equipment. We have exclusive licenses from Tufts University to
patents that cover our use of BeadArray technology. These
patents were filed by Dr. David Walt, a member of our board
of directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and
one of our founders. Our exclusive licenses expire with the
termination of the underlying patents, which will occur between
2010 and 2020. In 2001, we entered into a non-exclusive license
agreement with Amersham Biosciences that covers certain
technology contained in our BeadArray Reader. In 2002, we
obtained a non-exclusive license from Dade Behring Marburg GmbH
that relates to certain components of our GoldenGate assay. In
all cases, the agreements remain in effect over the term of the
underlying patents, may be terminated at our request without
further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties
while the agreement is in effect.

Marketing and Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis
portion of the life sciences market, in particular, experiments
involving SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. These
experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research
including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug
discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and
agricultural research. Our potential customers include
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and
consumer products companies, as well as academic or private
research centers. The genetic analysis market is relatively new
and emerging and its size and speed of development will be
ultimately driven by, among other items,

•

the ability of the research community to extract
    medically valuable information from genomics and to apply that
    knowledge to multiple areas of disease-related research and
    treatment,

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost,
    high-throughput research tools to enable the large amount of
    experimentation required to study genetic variation and
    function, and

•

the availability of government and private
    industry funding to perform the research required to extract
    medically relevant information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to
customers in North America, major European markets, Japan and
Singapore. In each of these areas we have dedicated sales,
service and application support personnel responsible for
expanding and managing their respective customer bases. In
markets outside of these areas, primarily the Pacific Rim
countries, we sell our products and provide services to
customers through distributors that specialize in life science
products. We expect to significantly increase our sales and
distribution resources during 2004 and beyond as we launch a
number of new products and expand the number of customers that
can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our array platforms, reagent kits,
scanning equipment and oligonucleotides in-house and believe
that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in
sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external
needs. We currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials
used in the manufacture of our products. We intend to continue,
and may extend, the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing
process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best
commercial interests.

During 2001, we moved into a new facility which
allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific
processes, and optimize material flow and personnel movement. In
addition, we have implemented information management systems for
many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all
aspects of material and sample use. We adhere to access and
safety standards required by federal, state and local health
ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal
of hazardous substances.



Competition

Although we expect that our BeadArray products
and services will provide significant advantages over currently
available products and services, we expect to encounter intense
competition from other companies that offer products and
services for the SNP genotyping and gene expression markets.
These include companies such as Aclara Biosciences, Affymetrix,
Agilent, Amersham Biosciences (recently acquired by
GE Corp.), Applied Biosystems, Beckman Coulter, Caliper
Technologies, Luminex, ParAllele Bioscience, Perlegen Sciences,
Sequenom and Third Wave Technologies. Many of these companies
have or will have substantially greater financial, technical,
research, and other resources and larger, more established
marketing, sales, distribution and service organizations than we
do. In addition, they may have greater name recognition than we
do in the markets we need to address and in some cases a large
installed base of systems. Each of these markets is very
competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the
intensity of competition to increase in the future. In order to
effectively compete with these companies, we will need to
demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost and
accuracy advantages over the existing products. Rapid
technological development may result in our products or
technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by us could be
made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective
products based on similar or other technologies. Although we
believe that our technology and products will offer advantages
that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies,
we cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Geographic Information

During 2003, $14.4 million, or 51%, of our
total revenues came from customers outside the United States, as
compared to $1.3 million, or 13%, in 2002. We expect that
sales to international customers will continue to be an
important and growing source of revenues. In 2003, we continued
to add sales support resources in Western Europe and opened
direct sales offices in Japan and Singapore. In addition, we
established new distributor relationships in China and Australia.

Information about the geographies in which we
operate can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements at Note 10, “Segment Information and
Geographic Data.”

Employees

As of December 28, 2003, we had a total of
236 employees, 53 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees and 103 of
whom are engaged in full-time research and development
activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor
union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.

Item 2.

Properties.

Our principal research and development,
manufacturing and administrative facilities occupy approximately
90,000 square feet of three buildings located in
San Diego, California, which we purchased, along with eight
acres of adjacent land, in January 2002. In connection with this
purchase we assumed a $26 million, 10-year mortgage on the
property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. We lease a total of
26,000 square feet of this space to two tenants. The land
has been approved for construction of a fourth building
although, we have no current plans to construct the fourth
building. We expect that these facilities will be sufficient for
our San Diego based operations for the foreseeable future.

In February 2003, the Company began leasing
approximately 3,300 square feet of office space in Tokyo
and in January 2004, began leasing approximately
1,600 square feet of office space in Singapore. These
facilities are used by local sales, marketing and field service
personnel. At December 28, 2003, annual future minimum
payments for these facilities were approximately $462,000.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an
unspecified amount was filed against us by a former employee in
the Superior Court of the State of California in connection with
the employee’s termination of employment with Illumina. In
July 2002 a California Superior Court judgment was rendered
against the Company and we recorded a $7.7 million charge
in our financial results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover
total damages and remaining expenses. We believe that the
termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was
unsupported by evidence presented at the trial. A notice of
appeal in this case was filed on October 10, 2002, and the
appeal process is ongoing. We are also recording interest
expense on the $7.7 million during the appeal based on the
statutory rate.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems Group filed
a complaint, then later in March 2003 amended and refiled a
complaint, for a patent infringement suit against us in the
federal court in Northern California asserting infringement of
several patents related to an Applied Biosystems’ assay
intended for use in our collaboration. Applied Biosystems seeks
a judgment granting it damages for infringement, treble damages
alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent
injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement. We have
answered the complaint, asserting various defenses, including
that we do not infringe the patents or that the patents are
invalid, and asserting



counterclaims against Applied Biosystems seeking
declaratory judgment relief related to the patents being
asserted against us, and seeking damages from Applied Biosystems
for its unfair and unlawful conduct which constitutes attempted
monopolization in violation of the antitrust laws.

Also in December 2002, Applied Biosystems sent a
notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint
development agreement between Illumina and Applied Biosystems
entered into in November 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration
pursuant to that agreement. This notification alleged that our
production-scale genotyping products and services are
collaboration products developed under the joint development
agreement, and that our commercial activities with respect to
our genotyping products and services are unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent. Among other relief, Applied Biosystems is seeking
compensatory damages of $30 million, disgorgement of all
revenues received from sales of these products and services and
a prohibition of future sales of these products or services.

In December 2002, we filed a suit alleging breach
of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, unfair competition and other allegations against
Applied Biosystems in San Diego Superior Court, and a
motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the
arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by Applied
Biosystems. In December 2003, we notified Applied Biosystems
that we terminated the joint development agreement.

In December 2003, after having granted temporary
and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration, the
San Diego Superior Court directed Applied Biosystems and us
to resolve the contract dispute in a binding arbitration
procedure. While a definitive schedule has not yet been set, we
believe that the arbitration process could be completed as early
as September 2004. We will vigorously defend against the claims
alleged by Applied Biosystems but the outcome of an arbitration
proceeding is inherently uncertain and we cannot be sure that we
will prevail. This arbitration could result in a range of
potential outcomes, based solely on the judgment and discretion
of the arbitrator, including (1) the award of all damages
and injunctive relief sought by Applied Biosystems; (2) the
award of all damages and relief sought by us; or (3) a
partial award of damages and/or injunctive relief to either
party. We have not accrued for any potential losses in this case
because we believe that an adverse determination is not
probable, and potential losses cannot be reasonably estimated.
In addition, our financial statements include a $10 million
advance payment from Applied Biosystems that would have been
deducted from the profits otherwise payable to us from Applied
Biosystems had the collaboration been successful and which could
offset the impact on our consolidated results of operations of
an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount. However,
any unfavorable arbitration determination, and in particular any
significant cash amounts required to be paid by the Company or
prohibition of the sale of our products or services, could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We are in the early stages of proceedings in the
patent case. In February 2004, the federal district court in
Northern California ordered that the patent case be stayed
pending completion of the arbitration process. We intend to
vigorously defend against the claims alleged by Applied
Biosystems and continue to pursue our counterclaims against
Applied Biosystems. However, we cannot be sure that we will
prevail in these matters. Any unfavorable determination, and in
particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by
the Company or prohibition of the sale of our products or
services, could result in a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.



Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
    Holders.

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of 2003.

use proceeds from our initial public offering to fund
operations. Through December 28, 2003, we have used
approximately $18 million to purchase property, plant and
equipment and approximately $38 million to fund general
operating expenses. The remaining balance is invested in a
variety of interest-bearing instruments including
U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt securities and
money market accounts.

those discussed elsewhere.

Overview

Illumina, Inc. was incorporated in April 1998. We
are developing next-generation tools for the large-scale
analysis of genetic variation and function. Understanding
genetic variation and function is critical to the development of
personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics. Using our
technologies, we have developed a comprehensive line of products
that are designed to provide the throughput, cost effectiveness
and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life
sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions
of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information
from advances in genomics. This information is expected to
correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular
disease states, enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to
be detected earlier and more specifically, and permitting better
choices of drugs for individual patients.

In November 1999, we entered into a joint
development agreement with Applied Biosystems under which the
companies would jointly develop a SNP genotyping system that
would combine our BeadArray technology with Applied
Biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under
this agreement, we were primarily responsible for developing and
manufacturing the arrays and Applied Biosystems was primarily
responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments,
SNP assay reagents, and software and for marketing the system
worldwide. In conjunction with the agreement, Applied Biosystems
purchased 1.25 million shares of Series C convertible
preferred stock at $4.00 per share. In addition, Applied
Biosystems agreed to provide us with non-refundable research and
development support of $10 million, all of which was
provided by December 2001. Upon commercialization of the system,
we would have received a share of the operating profits from the
sales of all components of these systems. We had originally
deferred recognition of revenue from the research funding of
$10 million provided by Applied Biosystems, and would have
recognized such amounts as revenue at a contractually defined
rate of 25% of the total profit share we earned from the sales of



collaboration products, had such sales occurred.
As of December 28, 2003, this amount has been reclassified
to an advance payment from former collaborator.

In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. We do not believe that Applied Biosystems has
any intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product
with us, and it has recently launched a competing product. As a
result of the delay in developing the collaboration product, we
launched our own production-scale genotyping system in July 2002
utilizing our arrays and an independently developed scanner and
assay method.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems filed a
complaint, then later in March 2003 amended and refiled a
complaint, for a patent infringement suit against us in the
federal court in Northern California asserting infringement of
several patents related to Applied Biosystems’ patented
assay intended for use in our collaboration. Applied Biosystems
seeks a judgment granting it damages for infringement, treble
damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a
permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged
infringement. We have answered the complaint, asserting various
defenses, including that we do not infringe the patents or that
the patents are invalid, and asserting counterclaims against
Applied Biosystems seeking declaratory judgment relief related
to the patents being asserted against us, and seeking damages
from Applied Biosystems for its unfair and unlawful conduct
which constitutes attempted monopolization in violation of the
antitrust laws.

Also in December 2002, Applied Biosystems sent a
notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint
development agreement entered into in November 1999 and seeking
to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement. This
notification alleged that our production-scale genotyping
products and services are collaboration products developed under
the joint development agreement, and that our commercial
activities with respect to our genotyping products and services
are unlawful, unfair or fraudulent. Among other relief, Applied
Biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of $30 million,
disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these
products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these
products or services.

In December 2002, we filed a suit alleging breach
of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, unfair competition and other allegations against
Applied Biosystems in San Diego Superior Court, and a
motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the
arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by Applied
Biosystems. In December 2003, we notified Applied Biosystems
that we terminated the joint development agreement.

In December 2003, after having granted temporary
and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration, the
San Diego Superior Court directed Applied Biosystems and us
to resolve the contract dispute in a binding arbitration
procedure. While a definitive schedule has not yet been set, we

party. We have not accrued for any potential losses in this case
because we believe that an adverse determination is not
probable, and potential losses cannot be reasonably estimated.
In addition, our financial statements include a $10 million
advance payment from Applied Biosystems that would have been

Biosystems had the collaboration been successful and which could
offset the impact on our consolidated results of operations of
an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount. However,
any unfavorable arbitration determination, and in particular any
significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or
prohibition of the sale of our products or services, could
result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.



We are in the early stages of proceedings in the
patent case. In February 2004, the federal district court in
Northern California ordered that the patent case be stayed
pending completion of the arbitration process. We intend to
vigorously defend against the claims alleged by Applied
Biosystems and continue to pursue our counterclaims against
Applied Biosystems. However, we cannot be sure that we will

condition and results of operations.

In the first quarter of 2001, we began commercial
sale of short pieces of DNA, or oligos, manufactured using our
proprietary Oligator technology. We believe our Oligator
technology is more cost effective than competing technologies,
which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a
price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross
margins. In the second quarter of 2001, we initiated our SNP
genotyping services product line. As a result of the increasing
market acceptance of our high throughput, low cost BeadArray
technology, we have entered into genotyping services contracts
with many of the leading genotyping organizations including
GlaxoSmithKline and The Sanger Centre, and have been awarded
$9 million from the National Institutes of Health to play a
major role in the International HapMap Project.

Our production-scale genotyping system, BeadLab,
is based on the system we developed that has been operational in
our genotyping service product line since 2001. In addition to
our Sentrix Array Matrices, it includes the BeadArray Reader, a
proprietary scanner that uses a laser to read the results of
experiments captured on our arrays, as well as the GoldenGate
SNP genotyping assay which can analyze up to 1536 SNPs per DNA
sample. This system is initially being marketed to a small
number of high throughput genotyping users.

In the first quarter of 2003, we completed the
installation of and recorded revenue for our first BeadLab
high-throughput SNP genotyping system. We installed and recorded
revenue for a second BeadLab in the second quarter of 2003, two
additional BeadLabs in the third quarter of 2003 and a fifth and
sixth BeadLab system in the fourth quarter of 2003.

In the second quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a new array format, the Sentrix BeadChip, which is
expected to significantly expand market opportunities for our
BeadArray technology and provide increased experimental
flexibility for life science researchers.

In the third quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a gene expression product line on both the Sentrix
Array Matrix and the Sentrix BeadChip that will allow
researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to 96
samples on a single array.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we announced the
launch of a benchtop SNP genotyping system, the BeadStation, for
performing medium scale genotyping using our technology. The
BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader, genotyping analysis
software and GoldenGate assay reagents and is designed to match
the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of
individual research groups and core labs. This system is
expected to be available for shipment in the second quarter of
2004.

In the first quarter of 2004, we announced the
launch of two new Sentrix BeadChips for whole-genome gene
expression. These BeadChips are designed to enable
high-performance, cost-effective, whole-genome expression
profiling of multiple samples on a single chip, resulting in a
dramatic reduction in cost of whole-genome expression analysis
while allowing researchers to expand the scale and
reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation.

We are seeking to expand our customer base for
our BeadArray technology; however, we can give no assurance that
our sales efforts will continue to be successful.

A significant portion of our current revenue is
derived from a few, large individual transactions such as the
sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping
services contracts, including our work on the International
HapMap Project. Because these transactions do not occur
regularly and



there is a lengthy sales cycle for such
transactions, revenue of these types may not occur on a
consistent or frequent basis. In addition, our total amount of
revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality
impacts, the timing and amount of U.S. government grant
funding programs, the timing and size of research projects our
customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the
life science industry. Given the difficulty in predicting the
timing and magnitude of sales for our products, we may
experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue, resulting
in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.
Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net
income or loss, we believe quarterly comparisons of our
operating results are not a good indication of our future
performance.

We have incurred substantial operating losses
since our inception. As of December 28, 2003, our
accumulated deficit was $117.5 million, and total
stockholders’ equity was $47.4 million. These losses
have principally occurred as a result of the substantial
resources required for the research, development and
manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our
products and services, as well as charges of $8.8 million
related to a termination-of-employment lawsuit. We expect to
continue to incur substantial costs for research, development
and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several
years. We will also need to significantly increase our selling,
general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and
marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of
systems, other products and services. As a result, we will need
to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability

Results of Operations

To enhance comparability, the following table
sets forth audited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
years ended December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001 stated as a percentage of total
revenue.



Comparison of Years Ended December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002 was $28.0 million and
$10.0 million, respectively. Product revenue increased to
$18.4 million in 2003 from $4.1 million in 2002. The
increase resulted almost entirely from the first sales of our
BeadLab SNP genotyping system, with six systems sold in the year
ended December 28, 2003, along with sales of consumables
that are used on these systems. Prior to 2003 we had no sales of
genotyping systems or consumable products. SNP genotyping
service revenue increased to $6.5 million in 2003 from
$3.3 million in 2002. Substantially all of this increase
relates to genotyping services performed for the International
HapMap Project, which commenced in 2003. We are the recipient of
a grant from the National Institutes of Health covering our
participation in the International HapMap Project, which is a
$100 million, internationally funded successor project to
the Human Genome Project that will help identify a map of
genetic variations that may be used to perform disease-related
research. We could receive up to $9.1 million of funding
for this project which covers basic research activities, the
development of SNP assays and the genotyping to be performed on
those assays. We recognized revenue under this grant of
$3.7 million in 2003 and, as of the end of 2003, we had
approximately $5.4 million of funding remaining related to
this project which is expected to be received in 2004, depending
on the actual amount of work that we perform. Government grants
and other research funding increased to $3.2 million for
the year ended December 28, 2003 from $2.6 million for
the year ended December 29, 2002 due to an increase in the
number of grants received.

To expand revenue in the future, we have recently
launched a series of new products that we expect to begin
selling in 2004. These include our BeadStation system for
moderate throughput genotyping needs, and two multi-sample whole
genome gene expression BeadChips that are also processed on a
BeadStation. Our BeadLab systems address a limited number of
potential high throughput genotyping customers, and sales of
these systems may decline in 2004 versus 2003. We expect the
sales of the new products mentioned above to offset such decline
and for overall revenues to increase above 2003 levels; however,
we cannot be assured that we will be successful in these sales
efforts.

Cost of Product and Service Revenue

Cost of revenue represents manufacturing costs
incurred in the production process, including component
materials, assembly labor and overhead, packaging and delivery
cost. Costs related to research revenue is included in research
and development expense. Cost of product and service revenue
increased to $10.0 million the year ended December 28,
2003 from $3.5 million for the year ended December 29,
2002. Substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales
of our BeadLab systems and consumables, of which we had none in
2002, as well as the higher level of services revenue during
2003. Gross margins on product and service revenues were 60% in
the year ended December 28, 2003, compared to 52% for the
year ended December 29, 2002. This increase is due



primarily to increased sales of higher margin
products and services such as SNP genotyping services, array
matrices and assay reagents. We expect product mix will continue
to affect our future gross margins. We also expect our total
cost of product and service revenue to increase in the next year
as we sell additional products, but to decrease as a percent of
product and service revenue due to gains in manufacturing
efficiencies and the sale of a larger proportion of higher
margin products.

Research and Development Expenses

Our research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses,
laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design,
development, testing and enhancement of our products. We expense
our research and development expenses as they are incurred.
Research and development expenses decreased $4.3 million to
$22.5 million for the year ended December 28, 2003
from $26.8 million for the year ended December 29,
2002.

During the year ended December 28, 2003, the
cost of BeadArray research activities decreased
$3.8 million as compared to the year ended
December 29, 2002. The decrease occurred primarily as a
result of completing the development of new products launched in
2003: the BeadChip, an additional microarray platform, a gene
expression application on both our Array Matrix and BeadChip
platforms and a benchtop SNP genotyping system, the BeadStation,
for performing moderate scale genotyping. In addition, as we
completed development efforts and increased our BeadArray-driven
product sales, a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources
was charged to research and development expense in 2003 than in
2002.

Research to support our Oligator technology
platform decreased $0.5 million in the year ended
December 28, 2003 as compared to the year ended
December 29, 2002. This decline is primarily due to higher
development expenses incurred in the first quarter of 2002 for a
major upgrade of our Oligator technology, which resulted in a
significant increase in our manufacturing capacity. In the
second quarter of 2003, we implemented additional Oligator
manufacturing enhancements to expand capacity, increase
throughput, and further reduce operating costs. We expect that
our research and development expenses will remain relatively
flat over the next 12 months.

Stock based compensation related to research and
development employees and consultants was $1.3 million for
the year ended December 28, 2003 as compared to
$2.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2002.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing,
finance, human resources, business development and general
management, as well as professional fees, such as expenses for
legal and accounting services. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $9.8 million to
$18.9 million for the year ended December 28, 2003
from $9.1 million for the year ended December 29,
2002. Approximately $4.4 million of this increase is
related to higher legal expenses, which is primarily due to
legal proceedings regarding the disputes with Applied
Biosystems. Approximately $4.1 million of the increase is
due to higher sales and marketing costs, of which
$3.0 million is attributable to personnel related expenses
while the majority of the remaining $1.1 million is
attributable to an increase in facility related expenses. During
2003, we



significantly expanded our sales and marketing
resources to support the direct sale of our new products,
including establishing additional sales operations in Japan and
Singapore. We expect that our selling, general and
administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff,
add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional
costs to support the commercialization and support of an
increasing number of products.

Stock based compensation related to selling,
general and administrative employees, directors and consultants
was $1.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2003
as compared to $2.0 million for the year ended
December 29, 2002.

Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
    Other Stock-Based Compensation Charges

From our inception through July 27, 2000, in
connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of
restricted stock to employees, founders and directors, we have
recorded deferred stock compensation totaling
$17.7 million, representing the difference between the
exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common
stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date
such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was
sold. We recorded this amount as a component of
stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to
operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and
options.

We recognize compensation expense over the
vesting period for employees, founders and directors, using an
accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28.
For consultants, deferred compensation is recorded at the fair
value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 and is
periodically re-measured and expensed in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-18.

We recorded amortization of deferred compensation
of $2.5 million and $4.4 million for the years ended
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.
We expect amortization of deferred compensation to decrease in
2004 due to the nature of the accelerated depreciation
methodology as the options near the end of their vesting period.

Litigation Judgment

A $7.7 million charge was recorded in June
2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a
termination-of-employment lawsuit. We believe that the
termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was
unsupported by evidence presented at the trial. We plan to
vigorously defend our position on appeal. A notice of appeal in
this case was filed on October 10, 2002, and the appeal
process is ongoing. During the appeal process, the court
requires us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at
statutory rates until the case is resolved. For the years ended
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, we recorded
litigation expense of $756,000 and $352,000, respectively, for
interest.



Interest Income

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents
and investments was $1.8 million and $3.8 million for
the years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29,
2002, respectively. The decrease is due to lower average levels
of invested funds and lower effective interest rates.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $2.3 million for the
years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002.
Interest expense relates primarily to a $26.0 million fixed
rate loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the
first quarter of 2002.

Provision for Income Taxes

We incurred net operating losses for the years
ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and
accordingly, we did not pay any federal or state income taxes.
We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of
the resulting net deferred tax asset, as the future realization
of the tax benefit is uncertain. As of December 28, 2003,
we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
tax purposes of approximately $69.5 million and
$27.0 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2018
and 2006.

We also had federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, which
begin to expire in 2018, unless previously utilized.

Our utilization of the net operating losses and
credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations
pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
Code, and similar state provisions, as a result of changes in
our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in
the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to
utilization.

Comparison of Years Ended December 29,
    2002 and December 30, 2001

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001 was $10.0 million and
$2.5 million, respectively. Product revenue increased to
$4.1 million in 2002 from $0.9 million in 2001, mostly
due to higher sales of oligonucleotides. SNP genotyping service
revenue was $3.3 million in 2002 compared to
$0.1 million in 2001 as a result of several contracts that
were signed during 2002; 2001 was the first year of operations
for our services and we experienced limited revenues. Government
grants and other research funding increased to $2.6 million
for the year ended Decem-



ber 29, 2002 from $1.5 million for the
year ended December 30, 2001 due to a larger number of
grants that were awarded to us.

Cost of Product and Service Revenue

Cost of product and service revenue for the years
ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 was
$3.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The
increase was driven by the increased sales of products and
services. Gross margins on product and service revenues were 52%
in 2002, versus 44% in 2001, driven by a more favorable cost
structure in oligo manufacturing.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased
$6.1 million to $26.8 million for the year ended
December 29, 2002, from $20.7 million for the year
ended December 30, 2001. The increase in expenses was
driven primarily by higher headcount, related personnel costs
and higher laboratory and manufacturing supplies required to
continue development of our BeadArray technology, which is the
underlying technology on which Illumina was founded. During the
year ended December 29, 2002, the research expense to
support our BeadArray activities increased $5.4 million
over the same period in 2001. These additional research and
development expenses were related to activities such as
exploring and optimizing assays for various types of genetic
analysis experiments, increasing the multiplexing level of our
arrays, continuing development of our arrays and the scanning
instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and
optimizing our SNP genotyping services system. Research to
support our Oligator technology platform increased
$0.7 million during the year ended December 29, 2002,
as compared to the year ended December 30, 2001. During
2002, we introduced upgrades to our Oligator technology that
significantly increased capacity and quality while reducing
manufacturing cost.

Stock based compensation related to research and
development employees and consultants was $2.4 million for
the year ended December 29, 2002 as compared to
$3.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2001.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $3.4 million to $9.1 million for the year
ended December 29, 2002, from $5.7 million for the
year ended December 30, 2001. A portion of this increase is
due to higher legal expenses related to a
termination-of-employment lawsuit as well as higher legal
expenses related to securing patents. The remaining increase was
due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to
expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and SNP
genotyping services operations.



Stock based compensation related to selling,
general and administrative employees, directors and consultants
was $2.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2002
as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended
December 30, 2001.

Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
    Other Stock-Based Compensation Charges

In connection with the grant of stock options and
sale of restricted common stock to employees, founders and
directors through July 27, 2000, we recorded deferred
compensation of approximately $17.7 million. We recorded
amortization of this deferred compensation of $4.4 million
and $5.9 million for the years ended December 29, 2002
and December 30, 2001, respectively.

Interest Income

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents
and investments was $3.8 million and $6.2 million for
the years ended December 29, 2002 and December 30,
2001, respectively. Interest income decreased in 2002 due to
lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective
interest rates.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $2.3 million for the
year ended December 29, 2002 as compared to
$0.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2001.
Interest expense for the year ended December 29, 2002
resulted primarily from a $26.0 million loan related to the
purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 28, 2003, we had cash, cash
equivalents and investments (including restricted cash and
investments of $100,000) of approximately $32.9 million. In
addition, we had long term restricted investments of
$12.2 million. We currently invest our funds in
U.S. dollar based investment-grade corporate and government
debt securities with average maturities of approximately
22 months.

Our operating activities used cash of
$18.3 million in the year ended December 28, 2003, as
compared to $25.6 million in the year ended
December 29, 2002. Net cash used in operating activities in
2003 was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of
$27.1 million reduced by non-cash charges of
$4.5 million for depreciation and amortization and non-cash
charges of $2.5 million for amortization of deferred stock
compensation. Net cash used in operating activities in 2002 was
primarily the result of a net loss from operations of
$40.3 million reduced by an $8.1 million increase in
accrued litigation judgment, non-cash charges of
$4.5 million for depreciation and amortization and non-cash
charges of $4.4 million for amortization of deferred stock
compensation.



Our investing activities provided cash of
$28.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2003 as
compared to cash used of $2.6 million in the year ended
December 29, 2002. Cash provided in investing activities in
the year ended December 28, 2003 was due primarily to the
sale or maturity of investment securities used to provide
operating funds for our business, while cash used in the year
ended December 29, 2002 was due primarily to the purchase
of a new facility offset by maturities of investment securities.
Capital expenditures were $2.0 million in 2003 and are
expected to increase $1 to $2 million in 2004.

Our financing activities provided
$0.2 million in the year ended December 28, 2003 as
compared to $26.1 million in the year ended
December 29, 2002. Cash provided by financing activities in
the year ended December 29, 2002 resulted primarily from
$26.0 million in loan proceeds related to the purchase of
our new facility.

In June 2002, we recorded a $7.7 million
charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to
a termination-of-employment lawsuit. As a result of our decision
to appeal the ruling, we filed a surety bond with the court on
October 25, 2002 of 1.5 times the judgment amount, or
approximately $11.3 million. Under the terms of the bond,
we are required to maintain a letter of credit for 90% of the
bond amount to secure the bond. Further, we were required to
deposit approximately $12.5 million of marketable
securities as collateral for the letter of credit and
accordingly, these funds will be restricted from use for
corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed. If a
judgment is due, we expect payment will occur within 12 to
18 months.

As of the end of 2003, we had funding remaining
under existing NIH grants of approximately $6.5 million,
including $5.4 million available under the International
HapMap Project. All of these amounts are scheduled to be paid in
2004, subject to the actual amount of activities we perform
under these grants.

Based on our current operating plans, we expect
that our current cash and cash equivalents, investments,
revenues from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient
to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least 18 to 24
months. Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our
business including amounts required to fund working capital and
capital expenditures. At the current time, we have no material
commitments for capital expenditures. However, our future
capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds
will depend on many factors, including our ability to
successfully commercialize our SNP genotyping laboratory and
gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to
expand our oligonucleotide and SNP genotyping services product
lines, scientific progress in our research and development
programs, the magnitude of those programs, competing
technological and market developments, the successful resolution
of our legal proceedings with Applied Biosystems and the
successful resolution of our appeal in a termination of
employment lawsuit. Therefore, we may require additional funding
within this time frame and the additional funding, if needed,
may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at
all. Further, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to
our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their
rights.

On December 23, 2003, we filed a shelf
registration statement that would allow us to raise up to
$65 million of funding through the sale of common stock in
one or more transactions. We currently do not have formal
arrangements to sell securities under the registration
statement, but if market and other business conditions become
favorable within the next several months, we could put such
arrangements in place and attempt to raise at least a portion of
the funds covered by the registration statement.

Contractual Obligations

In April 2000, we entered into a
$3.0 million loan arrangement to be used at our discretion
to finance purchases of capital equipment, $1.7 million of
which remains available at December 28, 2003.

In January 2002, we purchased two newly
constructed buildings and assumed a $26.0 million, 10-year
mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36% which
calls for principal and interest



payments of approximately $2.5 million per
year until the loan expires in January 2012 at which time a
balloon payment of $21.2 million will be due.

We also lease office space under non-cancelable
operating leases that expire at various times through December
2006. These leases contain renewal options ranging from 2 to
3 years.

As of December 28, 2003, our contractual
obligations are (in thousands);

Critical Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines
established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 101. Under SAB 101, revenue cannot be
recorded until all of the following criteria have been met:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Product revenue consists of sales of
oligonucleotides, array matrices, assay reagents, genotyping
systems and gene expression systems. Services revenue consists
of revenue received for performing genotyping services. Revenue
for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and
transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
reasonably assured. BeadLab genotyping system revenue is
recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment,
installation, training and fulfillment of contractually defined
acceptance criteria. Reserves are provided for anticipated
product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is
recognized. Revenue for genotyping services is recognized
generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered
to the customer. We have been awarded $9.1 million from the
National Institutes of Health to perform genotyping services in
connection with the International HapMap Project. A portion of
the revenue from this project is earned at the time the related
costs are incurred while the remainder of the revenue is earned
upon the delivery of genotyping data. Research revenue consists
of amounts earned under research agreements with government
grants, which is recognized in the period during which the
related costs are incurred. All revenues are recorded net of any
applicable allowances for returns or discounts.

We received $10 million of non-refundable
research funding from Applied Biosystems in connection with a
licensing and development contract entered into in 1999. This
amount was originally recorded as deferred revenue in accordance
with the provisions of SAB 101 and would have been
recognized as revenue at a contractually defined rate of 25% of
the defined operating profit earned from sales of the products
covered by the collaboration agreement, had such sales occurred.
At present, we do not believe a collaboration product will be
commercialized under the partnership agreement, and there are
legal proceedings between the parties as more fully described in
ITEM 3, “Legal Proceedings”. The $10 million
of research funding has been reclassified to an advance payment
from former collaborator until the legal proceedings have been
resolved.

Cash &
Investments.

We invest our excess cash
balances in marketable debt securities, primarily government
securities and corporate bonds and notes, with strong credit
ratings. We classify our investments as
“Available-for-Sale” under SFAS 115 and record
such investments at the estimated fair value in the balance
sheet, with gains and losses, if any, reported in
stockholders’ equity. We periodically review our
investments for other than temporary impairment.



Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In November 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force issued its consensus concerning

Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”).
EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine whether a revenue
arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided
into separate units of accounting, and, if separation is
appropriate, how the arrangement consideration should be
measured and allocated to the identified accounting units.
EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.

FIN 45 requires a liability to be recorded in
the guarantor’s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee.
In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the
guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation
of changes in the entity’s product warranty liabilities.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of
FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure
requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial
statements ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 clarifies under
what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment
meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in
SFAS No. 133 and when a derivative contains a
financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, and
to certain pre-existing contracts. The adoption of
SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

SFAS No. 150 affects the issuer’s
accounting for three types of freestanding financial
instruments; (a) mandatorily redeemable shares which the
issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or
other assets, (b) put options and forward purchase
contracts that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of
its shares in exchange for cash or other assets, and
(c) obligations that can be settled with shares, the
monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly
to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with
the value of the issuer’s shares. SFAS No. 150
also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the
instruments and the capital structure of entities.
SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and
for all periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46R”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

FIN 46R
replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,

which was issued in January
2003. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity’s residual returns or both. A variable interest
entity either (a) does not have equity investors with
voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources to the entity to support
its activities. FIN 46R is effective immediately for all
new variable interest entities created or acquired after
December 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.



Factors Affecting Our Operating
Results

In addition to the items mentioned above, the
following issues could adversely affect our operating results or
our stock price.

We have generated only a small amount of
    revenue from product and service offerings to date. We expect to
    continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain
    profitability.

We have incurred net losses since our inception
and expect to continue to incur net losses. At December 28,
2003, our accumulated deficit was approximately
$117.5 million, and we incurred a net loss of
$27.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 28,
2003. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative
cash flow for the foreseeable future. The magnitude of our net
losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of
our revenue and on the level of our expenses. We expect to
continue incurring significant expenses for research and
development, for developing our manufacturing capabilities and
for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products.
In addition, we expect that our selling and marketing expenses
will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the
launch of our BeadLab and BeadStation SNP genotyping system and
gene expression systems. As a result, we expect that our
operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and,
consequently, we will need to generate significant additional
revenue to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve
profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

Our success depends upon the increasing
    availability of genetic information and the continued emergence
    and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications
in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The
usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the
availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying
or treating disease. We are initially focusing on markets for
analysis of genetic variation and function, namely SNP
genotyping and gene expression profiling. Our first products are
being sold into the SNP genotyping and focused-gene expression
markets. Both of these markets are new and emerging, and they
may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full
potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and
function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing.
Also, researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic
data into medically valuable information through the analysis of
genetic variation and function. If useful genetic data is not
available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely
manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than
we expect, and we may never become profitable.

We are an early stage company with a
    limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable
    products, and our success depends on our ability to develop
    commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our
    new and unproven technologies.

We may not possess all of the resources,
capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and
commercialize all the products or services that may result from
our technologies. We only recently sold our first genotyping
systems, and some of our other technologies are in the early
stages of commercialization or are still in development. You
should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and
complexities affecting an early stage company developing tools
for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. We must
conduct a substantial amount of additional research and
development before some of our products will be ready for sale.
Problems frequently encountered in connection with the
development or early commercialization of products and services
using new and unproven technologies might limit our ability to
develop and successfully commercialize these products and
services. In addition, we may need to enter into agreements to
obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of
our products or services.



Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical
companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a
variety of technologies. Compared to the existing technologies,
our technologies are new and relatively unproven. In order to be
successful, our products must meet the commercial requirements
of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for
the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.

Market acceptance will depend on many factors,
including:

We have limited experience in manufacturing
    commercial products and services.

We have limited experience manufacturing our
products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve
significant commercial sales. We have only recently begun
manufacturing products on a commercial scale and operating our
internal SNP genotyping service product line. For example, in
the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing
conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields. Due
to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain
DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown
manufacturing difficulties in the future that could
significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to
sell these products, or to produce them economically, may
prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause
us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.

If we are unable to develop our
    manufacturing capability, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

We currently possess only one facility capable of
manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our
customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to
significantly damage our facility or if other events were to
cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from
developing and manufacturing our products and services.

If we are unable to find third-party
    manufacturers to manufacture components of our products, we may
    not be able to launch or support our products in a timely
    manner, or at all.

The nature of our products requires customized
components that currently are available from a limited number of
sources. For example, we currently obtain the fiber optic
bundles and BeadChip slides included in our products from single
vendors. If we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those
or other product components, we will be unable to meet demand
for our products. We may need to enter into contractual
relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production
of some of our products, or develop these capabilities
internally, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do
this on a timely basis, for sufficient quantities or on
commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able
to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at
commercially reasonable costs.

Our current sales, marketing and technical
    support organization may limit our ability to sell our
    products.

We currently have limited sales and marketing and
technical support services and have only recently established a
small direct sales force and customer support team. In order to
effectively



commercialize our genotyping and gene expression
systems and other products to follow, we will need to expand our
sales, marketing and technical support staff both domestically
and internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or
maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution
arrangements to market our products and services. In addition,
we compete primarily with much larger companies, that have
larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed
base of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales
and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market
acceptance of our products required to support continued growth
of our business.

We expect intense competition in our target
    markets, which could render our products obsolete or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This
    would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability. If
    we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products,
    our revenues may not grow as intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that
design, manufacture and market instruments for analysis of
genetic variation and function and other applications using
technologies such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary
electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
microfluidics, and mechanically deposited, inkjet and
photolithographic arrays. We anticipate that we will face
increased competition in the future as new companies enter the
market with new technologies. The markets for our products are
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and
new product introductions. For example, we expect Affymetrix to
release a 100k SNP genotyping chip and several competitors have
begun selling a single chip for whole human genome expression
which may compete with our SNP genotyping service and product
offerings and our gene expression product offerings. One or more
of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or
uneconomical. Our competitors have greater financial and
personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established
customer base and more experience in research and development
than we have. Furthermore, the life sciences and pharmaceutical
companies, which are our potential customers and strategic
partners, could develop competing products. If we are unable to
develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new
product offerings, our business, financial condition and results
of operations will suffer.

We may encounter difficulties in managing
    our growth. These difficulties could increase our
    losses.

We expect to experience rapid and substantial
growth in order to achieve our operating plans, which will place
a strain on our human and capital resources. If we are unable to
manage this growth effectively, our losses could increase. Our
ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires
us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational,
financial and management controls, reporting systems and
procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of
talented employees. If we are unable to scale up and implement
improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in
an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies
in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to
make available the products required to successfully
commercialize our technology. Failure to attract and retain
sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our
human resources and could impede our growth.

Any inability to adequately protect our
    proprietary technologies could harm our competitive
    position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to
obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our
intellectual property in the United States and other countries.
If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately,
competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby
erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States, and many companies have
encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary
rights abroad. These problems can be caused by the absence of
rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights.



The patent positions of companies developing
tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries,
including our patent position, generally are uncertain and
involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to
protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third
parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are
covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
maintained as trade secrets. We will apply for patents covering
our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However,
our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in
issued patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we
obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
practicing our technologies or from developing competing
products. There also is risk that others may independently
develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
patented technologies.

In April 2003, Applied Biosystems served us with
an amended complaint alleging patent infringement, asserting
that our genotyping products infringe several patents owned by
Applied Biosystems. Others may challenge or invalidate our
patents or claim that we infringe the rights of third party
patents, however, we are not aware of any other such parties
that currently intend to pursue patent infringement claims
against us. Also, our patents may fail to provide us with any
competitive advantage. We may need to initiate additional
lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against
third party claims, which would be expensive and, if we lose,
may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights
and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our
confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security
measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures,
however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. We seek to protect our
proprietary information by entering into confidentiality
agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants.
Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or consultants may still
disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to
meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade
secrets.

Litigation or other proceedings or third
    party claims of intellectual property infringement could require
    us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from
    selling our products or services.

Our commercial success depends in part on our
non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third
parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual
property. Applied Biosystems has served us with an amended
complaint alleging patent infringement and other third parties
have or may assert that we are employing their proprietary
technology without authorization. In addition, third parties
have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of
our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur
substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and
technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these
claims. We may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing
our patents against others. Furthermore, parties making claims
against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief,
which effectively could block our ability to further develop,
commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award
of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful
claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay
damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or
be prohibited from selling certain products. We may not be able
to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, or at all. In
that event, we could encounter delays in product introductions
while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.
Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these
licenses could prevent us from commercializing available
products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products
could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain
profitability.



We may need additional capital in the
    future. If additional capital is not available on acceptable
    terms, we may have to curtail or cease operations.

Our future capital requirements will be
substantial and will depend on many factors including our
ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and
services, the need for capital expenditures to support and
expand our business, the progress and scope of our research and
development projects, the filing, prosecution and enforcement of
patent claims, the success of our legal proceedings with Applied
Biosystems and the appeal of a wrongful termination lawsuit. We
anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to
maintain currently planned operations for at least 18 to 24
months. However, we premise this expectation on our current
operating plan, which may change as a result of many factors.
Consequently, we may need additional funding sooner than
anticipated. Our inability to raise capital would seriously harm
our business and product development efforts. In addition, we
may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions
or strategic considerations even if we believe we have
sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To
the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of
equity, the issuance of these securities could result in
dilution to our stockholders.

We currently have no credit facility or committed
sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with
$1.7 million unused and available as of December 28,
2003. To the extent operating and capital resources are
insufficient to meet future requirements; we will have to raise
additional funds to continue the development and
commercialization of our technologies. These funds may not be
available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are
not available on attractive terms, we may be required to curtail
operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into
financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive
terms.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable
    to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to
    achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and
scientific personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and
chief executive officer, David Barker, our vice president and
chief scientific officer, and John Stuelpnagel, our senior vice
president of operations. The loss of their services could
adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.
We will need to hire additional qualified personnel with
expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological
information processing, sales, marketing and technical support.
We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel
with other life science companies, universities and research
institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.
Competition for these individuals, particularly in the
San Diego area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be
high. Failure to attract and retain management and scientific
personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or
developing our products or technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional
expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the
products developed through our technologies, including the life
sciences and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add
new personnel, including management, and develop the expertise
of existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
growth of our business.

A significant portion of our sales are to
    international customers.

Approximately $14.4 million of our 2003
revenues were derived from customers outside the United States.
We intend to continue to expand our international presence and
export sales to international customers and we expect the total
amount of non-U.S. sales to continue to grow. Export sales
entail a variety of risks, including:

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory
    requirements of foreign countries into which we import our
    products;



•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or
    other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying
    with a variety of foreign laws.

In addition, sales to international customers
typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty
in accounts receivable collection. We are also subject to
general geopolitical risks, such as political, social and
economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade
relations. One or more of these factors could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
operating results.

We expect that our results of operations
    will fluctuate. This fluctuation could cause our stock price to
    decline.

A significant portion of our current revenue is
derived from a few large, individual transactions such as the
sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping
services contracts, including our work on the International
HapMap Project. Because these transactions do not occur
regularly and there is a lengthy sales cycle for such
transactions, revenue of these types may not occur on a
consistent or frequent basis. In addition, our total amount of
revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality
impacts, the timing and amount of U.S. government grant
funding programs, the timing and size of research projects our
customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the
life sciences industry. Given the difficulty in predicting the
timing and magnitude of sales for our products, we may
experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting
in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.
A large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including
expenses for facilities, equipment and personnel. In addition,
we expect operating expenses to continue to increase
significantly. Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as
anticipated, we may not be able to reduce our operating losses.
Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and
expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating
results are not a good indication of our future performance. If
our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations
of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price probably
would decline.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    about Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio.
The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely
impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned
on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases
in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use
interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to
interest rate changes. We ensure the safety and preservation of
our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market
risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by
investing in investment grade securities. A hypothetical
100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the
entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the
fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments.

Our equipment financings, amounting to
$0.3 million as of December 28, 2003, are all at fixed
rates and therefore, have no exposure to changes in interest
rates. In January 2002, we assumed a $26.0 million mortgage
in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related
land. The interest rate on this loan is fixed for a 10-year
period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing
market interest rates.

We have not had any significant exposure to
foreign currency rate fluctuations, nor do we have any foreign
currency hedging instruments in place.

Item 9.

Changes In and Disagreements With
    Accountants on Accounting and Financial
    Disclosure.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

We have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures to ensure that we record, process,
summarize, and report information we are required to disclose in
our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the manner and within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. We also design our disclosure
controls to ensure that the information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We also maintain
internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with
applicable laws and our established financial policies. We
design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
(2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
recorded and reported in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

We have evaluated the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are
effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required
information is timely made in accordance with the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. This evaluation was made under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer as of
December 28, 2003. Our management does not expect that our
disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. Notwithstanding, we have designed our internal control
system with a level of controls that we believe will prevent
material errors in our consolidated financial statements.

The chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded, based on their review, that our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined at Exchange Act
Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c), are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms and that our internal
controls are effective to provide reasonable assurance that our
financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
No significant changes were made to our internal controls or
other factors that could significantly affect these controls
during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Board Committees and Meetings

The board of directors held five meetings during
the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003. The board of
directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee.
Each director attended or participated in 75% or more of the
aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the board
of directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by
all committees of the board on which such director served during
the 2003 fiscal year.

The audit committee currently consists of three
directors, Mr. Greer, Mr. Nelsen and
Dr. Rastetter, each of whom is independent as defined under
Rule 4200 of the National Association of Securities
Dealers’ listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the
Exchange Act. The Board of Directors has determined that all
audit committee members are financially literate under the
current listing standards of the National Association of
Securities Dealers. The Board also determined that R. Scott
Greer qualifies as an “audit committee financial
expert” as defined by the SEC rules adopted pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The audit committee is responsible
for approving the services performed by our independent auditors
and reviewing our accounting practices and systems of internal
accounting controls. The audit committee held eight meetings
during 2003. The audit committee is governed by a written
charter approved by the board of directors.

The compensation committee currently consists of
Mr. Nelsen and Dr. Rastetter. The compensation
committee is primarily responsible for reviewing and approving
our general compensation policies and setting compensation
levels for our executive officers. The compensation committee
also has the authority to administer our 2000 employee stock
purchase plan and our 2000 stock plan. The compensation
committee held one meeting during 2003.

Director Compensation

Each non-employee director receives an annual
cash retainer fee of $10,000 per year, which is paid
quarterly. Non-employee directors also receive $2,000 for each
Board meeting attended and $1,000 for each Board committee
meeting attended. We also reimburse our non-employee directors
for their expenses incurred in connection with attending board
and committee meetings. Several directors have purchased shares
of our common stock pursuant to restricted stock purchase
agreements, subject to repurchase rights in our favor which
lapse over time. David R. Walt, as a member of our Scientific
Advisory Board, has received an annual consulting fee of
$50,000, which will terminate in April 2004.



Under our 2000 stock plan, as amended, directors
who are not our officers or employees receive:

•

one-time option grants of 20,000 shares
    vesting annually over four years upon joining the board, which
    are to be automatically granted on the date of the first board
    meeting attended, with exercise prices equal to the fair market
    value of our common stock on the date of grant; and

•

annual option grants of 10,000 shares
    vesting annually over four years, which are to be automatically
    granted on the date of each annual stockholder meeting with
    exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common
    stock on the date of grant.

On the date of the annual meeting, our existing
non-employee board members, Mr. Bradbury, Mr. Nelsen,
and Dr. Rastetter and, if re-elected, Mr. Greer and
Dr. Walt, will automatically receive option grants of
10,000 shares of our common stock. The exercise price per
share under each such option will be equal to the fair market
value per share of common stock on the grant date.

Identification of Executive Officers

Information concerning our executive officers is
set forth under “Executive Officers” in Part I of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act

The members of our board of directors, our
executive officers and persons who hold more than 10% of our
outstanding common stock are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act which require them to file reports with respect to their
ownership of our common stock and their transactions in such
common stock. Based solely upon our review of copies of
Section 16(a) reports, which we received from such persons
for their transactions during the 2003 fiscal year, we believe
that all reporting requirements under Section 16(a) for
such fiscal year were met in a timely manner by these
individuals, with the following exception, a Form 4
covering the sale of 5,275 shares of the Company’s
stock by Noemi Espinosa was filed 15 days late on
December 11, 2003.

Code of Ethics

The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics that
applies to all officers and employees, including its principal
executive officer and principal accounting and financial
officer. This code of ethics is filed as Exhibit 14 to this
annual report on Form 10-K.



Item 11.

Executive Compensation.

Summary of Cash and Certain Other
Compensation

The following table provides summary information
concerning the compensation earned by our chief executive
officer and each of our four other most highly compensated
executive officers whose salary and bonus for the 2003 fiscal
year was in excess of $100,000, for services rendered in all
capacities, to Illumina. No executive officer who would have
otherwise been includable in such table on the basis of salary
and bonus earned for the 2003 fiscal year has been excluded by
reason of his or her termination of employment or change in
executive status during that fiscal year. The individuals
included in the following table are referred to as named
executive officers.

Summary 2003 Compensation Table

(1)

Bonuses are earned in the year indicated and paid
    in February of the following year.

(2)

This amount represents an allowance for
    relocation and housing.

(3)

Payment for flexible time off.

Stock Option Grants

We grant options to our executive officers under
our 2000 stock plan. As of January 31, 2004, options to
purchase a total of 5,952,627 shares of our common stock
were outstanding under the stock plan and options to purchase
6,299,552 shares of our common stock remained available for
future grant.

The following tables show for the 2003 fiscal
year, information regarding options granted to, exercised by,
and held at year end by, each of the named executive officers.
No stock appreciation rights were granted to the named executive
officers during the 2003 fiscal year.

The exercise price of each option was equal to
the closing sales price of our common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant. The exercise price may
be paid in cash or through a cashless exercise procedure
involving a same-day sale of the purchased shares. The options
vest ratably over a 60-month period, beginning March 2003. Each
of the options has a maximum term of 10 years measured from
the applicable grant date, subject to earlier termination if the
optionee’s service with us ceases. In the event that we are
acquired by merger or asset sale, each outstanding



option which is not to be assumed by the
acquiring entity will become immediately fully vested and
exercisable.

The potential realizable value is calculated
based on the 10-year term of the option at the time of grant.
Stock price appreciation of 5% and 10% is assumed under the SEC
rules and does not represent our prediction of our stock price
performance. The potential realizable value at 5% and 10%
appreciation are calculated by assuming that the stock price on
the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate,
compounded annually for the entire term of the option and that
the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for
the appreciated stock price. There can be no assurance provided
to any named executive officer or other holder of our securities
that the actual stock price appreciation over the 10-year term
will be at the assumed 5% and 10% levels or at any other defined
level. Unless the market price of the common stock appreciates
over the option term, no value will be realized from the option
grants made to the named executive officers. On
December 26, 2003, the last trading day of our 2003 fiscal
year, the closing sales price of our common stock, as reported
on the Nasdaq National Market, was $7.01.

Percentages shown under “Percentage of Total
Options Granted in 2003” are based on an aggregate of
1,199,275 options granted to employees of Illumina under our
stock option plans during 2003.

Aggregate Option Exercises in 2003 and Option
Values at December 28, 2003

The following table presents the number and value
of securities underlying unexercised options that are held by
each of the named executive officers. No options were exercised
by any of the named executive officers and no stock appreciation
rights were outstanding during the 2003 fiscal year.

Amounts shown under the column “Value of
Unexercised In-the-Money Options at December 28, 2003”
are based on the closing price of our common stock of $7.01 on
December 26, 2003, the last trading day of our 2003 fiscal
year, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market, less the
exercise price paid for such shares, without taking into account
any taxes that may be payable in connection with the
transaction, multiplied by the number of shares underlying the
option.



Employment Contracts, Termination of
Employment and Change in Control Arrangements

We have not entered into employment agreements
with any of our named executive officers.

We have entered into restricted stock purchase
agreements with several of our executive officers, including
each of our named executive officers, providing that upon the
closing of an acquisition of Illumina for cash or publicly
traded securities, the lapsing of our repurchase right
accelerates as to 50% of each officer’s shares of common
stock then subject to our repurchase right and, with respect to
the remaining 50%, on the first anniversary of the closing date
of the acquisition. If the acquirer terminates the
officer’s employment without cause within one year of the
closing date, our repurchase right lapses with respect to all
shares.

The compensation committee of the board of
directors, as plan administrator of our stock plans, has the
authority to provide for accelerated vesting of any outstanding
options or waiver of forfeiture restrictions of unvested stock
held by our executive officers, for any reason, including upon a
change of control.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation

Our executive compensation program has been
administered by the compensation committee of our board of
directors. As of December 28, 2003, the compensation
committee consisted of Mr. Nelsen and Dr. Rastetter.
Neither of these individuals was an employee or an officer of
ours.

None of our current executive officers has ever
served as a member of a board of directors or compensation
committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more
executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors
or compensation committee during the last fiscal year.

Board Compensation Committee Report on
Executive Compensation

The compensation committee’s responsibility
is to administer and review the base salaries, annual incentive
compensation and long-term incentives of our executive officers,
including our chief executive officer, and to establish the
general compensation policies for such individuals. The
compensation committee also has the authority to make
discretionary option grants to our executive officers under our
2000 stock plan.

Compensation
Philosophy.

Our philosophy is to
maintain an executive compensation program that allows us to
attract, retain and reward executive officers who contribute to
our long-term success and to link that compensation to both
individual performance and the value created for our
stockholders. We have adopted a challenging strategy with an
aggressive set of underlying goals and our success will in large
part be determined by the quality of personnel we are able to
recruit. A competitive compensation program will be a crucial
part of recruiting the people required to help us achieve these
goals.

Our compensation program consist of three
elements; base salary, incentive bonuses and long-term equity
incentives. In general, our goal is to provide a total
compensation package that is competitive with the biotechnology
and life science instrumentation companies with which we compete
for talent.

Base Salary.

The
salaries for executive officers for 2003 were generally
determined on an individual basis by the compensation committee.
Determinations of appropriate base salary levels are made based
on level of responsibility, prior experience and breadth of
knowledge as well as competitive pay practices in our industry.
Initial salary levels are set at the market average when
compared to leading companies in our industry, adjusted for
size. Subsequent changes to base salary are based on individual
performance measured against pre-established objectives and
competitive factors at the time.

Incentive Bonus.

The
compensation committee in its discretion may award bonuses to
executive officers. The intent of the bonus program is to
motivate and reward executives for performance as



measured against well defined performance goals.
The goals are based on both individual milestones that vary with
the individual’s position as well as our overall financial
performance.

Long-Term Equity
Incentives.

Stock options and stock
ownership are a key element in our total compensation program as
it links the interests of the executive with the long-term
interests of the stockholders and emphasizes the creation of
stockholder value. Prior to our initial public offering,
executives were provided the opportunity to purchase restricted
stock at the date of hire and at other times after that date.
Subsequent to our initial public offering, we have granted stock
options to executives under the 2000 stock plan at both the time
of hire and as subsequent awards. Grants are awarded based on a
number of factors, including our achievement of specific
milestones, the individual’s level of responsibility, the
amount and term of stock or options already held by the
individual, the individual’s contributions to the
achievement of our financial and strategic objectives, and
industry practices and norms. The size of option grants to
executives is determined by the compensation committee. Options
are granted at 100% of the fair market value on the date of
grant. Option grants to executives generally vest over periods
ranging from five to eight years, with opportunities in some
cases for earlier vesting based upon the achievement of
specified goals.

CEO Compensation.

The compensation of Jay T. Flatley, our chief executive
officer, is established consistent with Illumina’s general
compensation philosophy. In setting that salary, the
compensation committee considered several factors, including the
achievement of company goals during 2003, such as exceeding the
2003 sales goal for SNP genotyping systems and the launch of
several new products, as well as the level of leadership and
management required to complete development of our technology
and commercialize our products. Mr. Flatley’s salary
was increased from $340,000 in 2002 to $360,400 in 2003 in
recognition of these and other competitive factors.
Mr. Flatley also received a $96,107 bonus in 2003 based on
the same incentive plan as the other executive officers.

Compliance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 162(m).

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax
deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to
specified executive officers, to the extent that compensation
exceeds $1 million per covered officer in any fiscal year.
The limitation applies only to compensation that is not
considered to be performance-based. Non-performance based
compensation paid to our executive officers for the 2003 fiscal
year did not exceed the $1 million limit per officer. The
compensation committee does not anticipate that the
non-performance based compensation to be paid to our executive
officers for fiscal year 2004 will exceed that limit. Our stock
option plans have been structured so that any compensation
deemed paid in connection with the exercise of option grants
made under those plan with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the option shares on the grant date will qualify
as performance-based compensation which will not be subject to
the $1 million limitation. The compensation
committee’s present intention is to grant future
compensation that does not exceed the limitations of
Section 162(m), although the compensation committee
reserves the right to award compensation that does not comply
with these limits on a case-by-case basis.

It is the opinion of the compensation committee
that the executive compensation policies and plans provide the
necessary total remuneration program to properly align our
performance and the interests of our stockholders through the
use of competitive and equitable executive compensation in a
balanced and reasonable manner, for both the short and long-term.

We conclude our report with the acknowledgement
that no member of the compensation committee is a current
officer or employee of Illumina.

Item 13.

Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions.

We entered into a license agreement with Tufts
University in 1998 in connection with the license of patents
filed by Dr. David Walt, one of our directors.
Dr. Walt is the Robinson Professor of Chemistry at Tufts.
Under that agreement, we pay royalties to Tufts upon the
commercial sale of products based on the licensed technology. It
is our understanding that Tufts University pays a portion of the
royalties received from us to Dr. Walt, the amount of which
is controlled solely by Tufts University. We also provided Tufts
University with $100,000 per year in funding for five years
ending in July 2003 for research support. All future
transactions between us and our officers, directors, principal
stockholders and affiliates will be approved by a majority of
the independent and disinterested members of our board of
directors, and will be on terms no less favorable to us than
could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our
directors and executive officers and may indemnify other
officers, employees and other agents to the fullest extent
permitted by the Delaware law. We are also empowered under our
bylaws to enter into indemnification contracts with our
directors and officers and to purchase insurance on behalf of
any person whom we are required or permitted to indemnify.
Pursuant to this provision, we have entered into indemnity
agreements with each of our directors and officers.

In addition, our certificate of incorporation
provides that to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law,
our directors will not be liable for monetary damages for breach
of their fiduciary duty of care to Illumina and its
stockholders. This provision in the certificate of incorporation
does not eliminate the duty of care, and in appropriate
circumstances equitable remedies such as an injunction or other
forms of nonmonetary relief would remain available under
Delaware law. Each director will continue to be subject to
liability for breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to
Illumina, for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving
intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law, for acts or
omissions that the director believes to be contrary to the best
interests of Illumina or its stockholders, for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit,
for acts or omissions involving a reckless disregard for the
director’s duty to Illumina or its stockholders when the
director was aware or should have been aware of a risk of
serious injury to Illumina or its stockholders, for acts or
omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention
that amounts to an abdication of the director’s duty to
Illumina or its stockholders, for improper transactions between
the director and



Illumina and for improper distributions to
stockholders and loans to directors and officers. This provision
also does not affect a director’s responsibilities under
any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or state or
federal environmental laws.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of December 28, 2003
and December 29, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the years ended December 28, 2003,
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001. Our audits
also include the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Illumina, Inc. at
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended
December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Organization and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the “Company”) was
incorporated on April 28, 1998. The Company is developing
next-generation tools that will permit the large-scale analysis
of genetic variation and function. The information provided by
these analyses will help to enable the development of
personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics. The Company
believes its proprietary BeadArray

TM

technology will
provide the throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and
pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests
necessary to extract medically valuable information from
advances in genomics. This information is expected to correlate
genetic variation and gene function with particular disease
states, enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to be
detected earlier and more specifically and permitting better
choices of drugs for individual patients.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires that management make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenue and expenses incurred during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates

Certain Risks and
    Uncertainties

As further discussed in Note 6, Applied
Biosystems sent a notification to the Company alleging that the
Company had breached the joint development agreement entered
into in November 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant
to that agreement. This notification alleged that the
Company’s production-scale genotyping products and services
are collaboration products developed under the joint development
agreement, and that the Company’s commercial activities
with respect to its genotyping products and services are
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent. Among other relief, Applied
Biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of $30 million,
disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these
products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these
products or services. The Company has been directed to enter
into a binding arbitration with Applied Biosystems to resolve
the dispute, which could be completed as early as September
2004. This arbitration could result in a range of potential
outcomes, based solely on the judgment and discretion of the
arbitrator, including (1) the award of all damages and
injunctive relief sought by Applied Biosystems; (2) the
award of all damages and relief sought by the Company; or
(3) a partial award of damages and/or injunctive relief to
either party. The Company has not accrued for any potential
losses in this case because it believes that an adverse
determination is not probable, and potential losses cannot be
reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company’s financial
statements include a $10 million advance payment from
Applied Biosystems that would have been deducted from the
profits otherwise payable to the Company from Applied Biosystems
had the collaboration been successful and which could offset the
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
of an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount.
However, any unfavorable arbitration determination, and in
particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by
the Company or prohibition of the sale of its products or
services,

F-7


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

could result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly
liquid investments with a remaining maturity of less than three
months from the date of purchase.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

to its investments. Under
SFAS No. 115, the Company classifies its investments
as “Available-for-Sale” and records such assets at
estimated fair value in the balance sheet, with unrealized gains
and losses, if any, reported in stockholders’ equity. The
Company invests its excess cash balances in marketable debt
securities, primarily government securities and corporate bonds
and notes, with strong credit ratings. The Company limits the
amount of investment exposure as to institutions, maturity and
investment type. The cost of securities sold is determined based
on the specific identification method. Gross realized gains
totaled $342,693 and $810,201 for the years ended
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively.
Gross realized losses totaled $141 and $27,467 for the years
ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002,
respectively.

Restricted Cash and
    Investments

At December 28, 2003, restricted cash and
investments consist of $100,000 in a money market fund for a
bond deposit with the San Diego Superior Court related to
the Applied Biosystems litigation (see note 6). At
December 29, 2002, restricted cash and investments also
included securities that are used as collateral against a letter
of credit that have since been classified as long term.

Long-term restricted investments consist of
corporate debt securities that are used as collateral against a
letter of credit (see note 7).

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

Financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and accrued liabilities are carried at cost, which management
believes approximates fair value.

Collectibility of Accounts
    Receivable

We evaluate the collectibility of our trade and
financing receivables based on a combination of factors. We
regularly analyze our customer accounts, and, when we become
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
financial obligations to us, we record a specific reserve for
bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we
reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on historical experience.
We re-evaluate such reserves on a regular basis and adjust our
reserves as needed.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard
cost (which approximates actual cost) or market. Inventory
includes raw materials and finished goods that may be used in
the research and development process and such items are expensed
as consumed.

F-8


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
subject to review of impairment, and depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the assets (generally three to seven
years for equipment and five to forty years for buildings) using
the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements
is computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the related assets.

License Agreements

Intangible assets consist of three license
agreements. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 17,

Accounting for
Intangible Assets,

license agreements are recorded at cost.
The rights related to one of the license agreements are
amortized over its estimated useful life (five years) and the
rights related to the other two agreements are amortized based
on sales of related product and are expected to be fully
amortized by the end of fiscal 2005. The cost of these license
agreements was $809,450 and the Company has amortized $193,333
through December 28, 2003. Amortization expense for the
years ending December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002
was $185,000 and $8,333, respectively. The Company recorded no
amortization expense related to these license agreements in the
year ended December 30, 2001.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,

if indicators of impairment exist, the Company
assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by
determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be
recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If
impairment is indicated, the Company measures the future
discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset and
adjusts the value of the asset accordingly. While the
Company’s current and historical operating and cash flow
losses are indicators of impairment, the Company believes the
future cash flows to be received from the long-lived assets
recorded at December 28, 2003 will exceed the assets’
carrying value, and accordingly the Company has not recognized
any impairment losses through December 28, 2003.

Reserve for Product
    Warranties

The Company generally provides a one year
warranty on genotyping and gene expression systems. At the time
revenue is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for
estimated warranty expenses associated with system sales. This
expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue.

Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenue in accordance with
the guidelines established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101 (“SAB 101”). Under SAB 101,
revenue cannot be recorded until all the following criteria are
met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered; the seller’s price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Product revenue consists of sales of
oligonucleotides, array matrices, assay reagents, genotyping
systems and gene expression systems. Service revenue consists of
revenue received for performing SNP genotyping services. Revenue
for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and
transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
reasonably assured. BeadLab genotyping system revenue is
recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment,
installation, training and fulfillment of contractually defined
acceptance criteria. Reserves are provided for anticipated
product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is
recognized. Revenue for genotyping services is recognized
generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered
to the customer. The Company has been awarded

F-9


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

$9.1 million from the National Institutes of
Health to perform genotyping services in connection with the
International HapMap Project. A portion of the revenue from this
project is earned at the time the related costs are incurred
while the remainder of the revenue is earned upon the delivery
of genotyping data. Research revenue consists of amounts earned
under research agreements with government grants, which is
recognized in the period during which the related costs are
incurred. All revenues are recognized net of applicable
allowances for returns or discounts.

The Company received $10 million of
non-refundable research funding from Applied Biosystems in
connection with a licensing and development contract entered
into in 1999. This amount was originally recorded as deferred
revenue in accordance with the provisions of SAB 101 and
would have been recognized as revenue at a contractually defined
rate of 25% of the defined operating profit earned from sales of
the products covered by the collaboration agreement, had such
sales occurred. At present, the Company does not believe a
collaboration product will be commercialized under the
partnership agreement, and there are legal proceedings between
the parties as more fully described in Note 6. The
$10 million of research funding has been reclassified to an
advance payment from former collaborator until the legal
proceedings have been resolved.

Shipping and Handling
    Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in
cost of product sales and totaled approximately $143,000,
$50,000 and $9,000 for the years ended December 28, 2003,
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.

Research and Development

Expenditures relating to research and
development, including costs related to patent prosecution, are
expensed in the period incurred.

Software Development Costs

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,

to capitalize costs related to marketed software. To date, the
Company has only marketed software that is an incidental
component to its SNP genotyping and gene expression systems.
Accordingly, the Company capitalizes software costs that are
incurred after the later of 1) the establishment of
technological feasibility of the software or 2) the
completion of all research and development activities for the
other components of the product. Through December 28, 2003,
the period between achieving either of these milestones and the
general release date of the products has been very brief and
production costs thereafter were not significant. Accordingly,
the Company has not capitalized any qualifying software
development costs in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. The costs of developing routine enhancements are
expensed as research and development costs as incurred because
of the short time between the determination of technological
feasibility and the date of general release of the related
products.

The Company applies Statement of Position
(“SOP”) No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.

For the years ended 2003 and 2002, the Company capitalized
approximately $94,000 and $833,000, respectively, in costs
incurred to acquire and develop software associated with the
implementation of its Enterprise Resource Planning and
Laboratory Information Management systems. These costs are
amortized over the estimated useful life of the software of
seven years, beginning when the software is ready for its
intended use.

F-10


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred. Advertising costs were approximately $440,000 for
2003, $267,000 for 2002 and $57,000 for 2001.

Income Taxes

A deferred income tax asset or liability is
computed for the expected future impact of differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
as well as the expected future tax benefit to be derived from
tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense
is generally the net change during the year in the deferred
income tax asset or liability. Valuation allowances are
established when realizability of deferred tax assets is
uncertain. The effect of tax rate changes is reflected in tax
expense during the period in which such changes are enacted.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of the Company’s
wholly owned subsidiaries are their respective local currencies.
Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these operations are
translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are
translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the
period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation
of these subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded
directly as a separate component of stockholders’ equity
under the caption “Accumulated other comprehensive
income.”

Stock-Based Compensation

At December 28, 2003, the Company has three
stock-based employee and non-employee director compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note 5. As
permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,

the Company accounts for common
stock options granted, and restricted stock sold, to employees,
founders and directors using the intrinsic value method and,
thus, recognizes no compensation expense for options granted, or
restricted stock sold, with exercise prices equal to or greater
than the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the
date of the grant. The Company has recorded deferred stock
compensation related to certain stock options, and restricted
stock, which were granted prior to the Company’s initial
public offering with exercise prices below estimated fair value
(see Note 5), which is being amortized on an accelerated
amortization methodology in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation Number (“FIN”) 28.

Pro forma information regarding net loss is
required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if
the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and
employee stock purchases under the fair value method of that
statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
dates of grant using the fair value option pricing model (Black
Scholes) with the following weighted-average assumptions for
2003, 2002 and 2001:

F-11


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the vesting period. The Company’s pro forma information is
as follows (in thousands except per share amounts):

The pro forma effect on net loss presented is not
likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on reported
net income or loss in future years because these amounts reflect
less than five years of vesting.

Deferred compensation for options granted, and
restricted stock sold, to consultants has been determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task
Force 96-18 as the fair value of the consideration received or
the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is
more reliably measured. Deferred charges for options granted,
and restricted stock sold, to consultants are periodically
remeasured as the underlying options vest.

Comprehensive Loss

In accordance with SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

the Company has disclosed
comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Net Loss per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share are
presented in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings
per Share,

for all periods presented. In accordance with
SFAS No. 128, basic and net loss per share is computed
using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period, less shares subject to
repurchase. Diluted net loss per share is typically computed
using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares from stock options using the treasury stock
method. However, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per
share is the same as basic net loss per share because the
Company reported a net loss and therefore the inclusion

F-12


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

of weighted average shares of common stock
issuable upon the exercise of stock options would be
antidilutive.

The total number of shares excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share, prior to application
of the treasury stock method for options and warrants, was
5,809,649, 5,556,455 and 5,352,950 for the years ended
December 28, 2003, December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001, respectively.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or
53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31.

Effect of New Accounting
    Standards

In November 2002, the FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force (“EITF”) issued its consensus concerning

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

(“EITF 00-21”). EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine
whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables
should be divided into separate units of accounting, and, if
separation is appropriate, how the arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting
units. EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.

FIN 45 requires a liability to be recorded in
the guarantor’s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee.
In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the
guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation
of changes in the entity’s product warranty liabilities.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of
FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure
requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial
statements ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of
FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 clarifies under
what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment
meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in
SFAS No. 133 and when a derivative contains a
financing component that warrants special reporting in the
statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, and
to certain pre-existing contracts. The adoption of
SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

F-13


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.

SFAS No. 150 affects the issuer’s
accounting for three types of freestanding financial
instruments; (a) mandatorily redeemable shares which the
issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or
other assets, (b) put options and forward purchase
contracts that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of
its shares in exchange for cash or other assets, and
(c) obligations that can be settled with shares, the
monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly
to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with
the value of the issuer’s shares. SFAS No. 150
also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the
instruments and the capital structure of entities.
SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and
for all periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption
of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46R”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.

FIN 46R
replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,

which was issued in January
2003. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity’s residual returns or both. A variable interest
entity either (a) does not have equity investors with
voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources to the entity to support
its activities. FIN 46R is effective immediately for all
new variable interest entities created or acquired after
December 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

now occupied by the Company. That lease contained an option to
purchase the buildings together with certain adjacent land that
has been approved for construction of an additional building.
The Company exercised that option and purchased the properties
in January 2002 and assumed a $26 million, 10-year mortgage
on the property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. The Company
is required to make monthly payments of $208,974 representing
interest and principal through February 2012 at which time a
balloon payment of $21.2 million will be due.

Stockholders’ Equity

Common stock

As of December 28, 2003, the Company had
32,886,693 shares of common stock outstanding, of which
4,888,500 shares were sold to employees and consultants
subject to restricted stock agreements. The restricted common
shares vest in accordance with the provisions of the agreements,
generally over five years. All unvested shares are subject to
repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price. As of
December 28, 2003, 579,775 shares of common stock were
subject to repurchase.

Warrants

In connection with a lease financing facility in
1998, the Company issued the lessor warrants to purchase
43,183 shares of common stock at $.926 per share.
These warrants were exercised in February 2001.

Stock Options

In June 2000, the Company’s board of
directors and stockholders adopted the 2000 Stock Plan. The 2000
Stock Plan amended and restated the 1998 Incentive Stock Plan
and increased the shares reserved for issuance by
4,000,000 shares. In addition, the 2000 Stock Plan provides
for an automatic annual increase in the shares reserved for
issuance by the lesser of 5% of outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately
preceding fiscal year, 1,500,000 shares or such lesser
amount as determined by the Company’s board of directors.

In 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Incentive
Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and had reserved
5,750,000 shares of common stock for grants under the Plan.
The Plan provided for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory
stock options, stock bonuses and rights to purchase stock to
employees, directors or consultants of the Company. The Plan
provided that incentive stock options to be granted only to
employees at no less than the fair value of the Company’s
common stock, as determined by the board of directors at the
date of the grant. Options generally vest 20% one year from the
date of grant and ratably each month thereafter for a period of
48 months and expire ten years from date of grant. In
December 1999, the Company modified the plan to allow for
acceleration of vesting in the event of an acquisition or merger.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and
stockholders adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“Purchase Plan”). A total of 1,458,946 shares of

periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value
of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering
period, whichever is lower. The initial offering period
commenced in July 2000. In addition, the Purchase Plan provides
for annual increases of shares available for issuance under the
Purchase Plan beginning with fiscal 2001. 304,714, 128,721 and
64,674 shares were issued under the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Deferred Stock Compensation

Since the inception of the Company, in connection
with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted
stock to employees, founders and directors through July 25,
2000, the Company has recorded deferred stock compensation
totaling approximately $17.7 million, representing the
difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair
value of the Company’s common stock as estimated by the
Company’s management for financial reporting purposes on
the date such stock options were granted or restricted common
stock was sold. Deferred compensation is included as a reduction
of stockholders’ equity and is being amortized to expense
over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock.
During the year ended December 28, 2003, the Company
recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of
approximately $2.5 million.

Shares Reserved for Future
    Issuance

At December 28, 2003, the Company has
reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows

Stockholder Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the Board of Directors of
the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common
stock of the Company. The dividend was payable on May 14,
2001 (the “Record Date”) to the stockholders of record
on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to
purchase from the Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth
of a share of its Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock at a price of $100 per unit. The Rights will be
exercisable if a person or group hereafter acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock of the
Company or announces an offer for 15% or more of the outstanding
common stock. If a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
outstanding common stock of the Company, each Right will entitle
its holder to purchase, at the exercise price of the right, a
number of shares of common stock having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the right. If the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
after a person acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common
stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of common
shares of the acquiring company which at the time of such
transaction have a market value of two times the exercise price
of the right. The Board of Directors will be entitled to redeem
the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right at any time before
any such person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
the outstanding common stock. The rights expire on May 14,
2011 unless such date is extended or the rights are earlier
redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

Collaborative Agreements

Applied Biosystems Group (part of Applera
    Corporation)

In November 1999, the Company entered into a
joint development agreement with Applied Biosystems Group
(“Applied Biosystems”) under which the companies would
jointly develop a SNP genotyping system that would combine the
Company’s BeadArray technology with Applied
Biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under
this agreement, the Company was primarily responsible for
developing and manufacturing the arrays and Applied Biosystems
was primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the
instruments, SNP assay reagents, and software and for marketing
the system worldwide. In conjunction with the agreement, Applied
Biosystems purchased 1,250,000 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock at $4.00 per share. In
addition, Applied Biosystems agreed to provide the Company with
non-refundable research and development support of
$10 million, all of which was provided by December 2001.
Upon commercialization of the system, the Company would have
received a share of the operating profits resulting from the
sale of all components of these systems. The Company had
originally deferred recognition of revenue from the research
funding of $10 million provided by Applied Biosystems, and
would have recognized such amounts as revenue at a contractually
defined rate of 25% of the total profit share the Company earned
from the sales of collaboration products, had such sales
occurred. As of December 28, 2003 this amount has been
reclassified to an advance payment from former collaborator.

In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. The Company does not believe that Applied
Biosystems has any intention of continuing to develop a
collaboration product with the Company, and Applied Biosystems
has recently launched a competing product. As a result of the
delay in developing the collaboration product, the Company
launched its own production scale genotyping system in July 2002
utilizing the Company’s arrays and an independently
developed scanner and assay method.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems filed a
complaint, then later in March 2003 amended and refiled a
complaint, for a patent infringement suit against the Company in
the federal court in Northern California asserting infringement
of several patents related to Applied Biosystems’ patented
assay intended for use in the collaboration. Applied Biosystems
seeks a judgment granting it damages for infringement, treble
damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a
permanent injunction restraining the Company from the alleged
infringement. The Company has answered the complaint, asserting
various defenses, including that it does not infringe the
patents or that the patents are invalid, and asserting
counterclaims against Applied Biosystems seeking declaratory
judgment relief related to the patents being asserted against
it, and seeking damages from Applied Biosystems for its unfair
and unlawful conduct which constitutes attempted monopolization
in violation of the antitrust laws.

Also in December 2002, Applied Biosystems sent a
notification to the Company alleging that the Company had
breached the joint development agreement entered into in
November 1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that
agreement. This notification alleged that the Company’s
production-scale genotyping products and services are
collaboration products developed under the joint development
agreement, and that the Company’s commercial activities
with respect to its genotyping products and services are
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent. Among other relief, Applied
Biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of $30 million,
disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these
products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these
products or services.

In December 2002, the Company filed a suit
alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and other
allegations against Applied

F-21


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Biosystems in San Diego Superior Court, and
a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the
arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by Applied
Biosystems. In December 2003, the Company notified Applied
Biosystems that it terminated the joint development agreement.

In December 2003, after having granted temporary
and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration, the
San Diego Superior Court directed Applied Biosystems and
the Company to resolve the contract dispute in a binding
arbitration procedure. While a definitive schedule has not yet
been set, the Company believes that the arbitration process
could be completed as early as September 2004. The Company will
vigorously defend against the claims alleged by Applied
Biosystems but the outcome of an arbitration proceeding is
inherently uncertain and the Company cannot be sure that it will
prevail. This arbitration could result in a range of potential
outcomes, based solely on the judgment and discretion of the
arbitrator, including (1) the award of all damages and
injunctive relief sought by Applied Biosystems; (2) the
award of all damages and relief sought by the Company; or
(3) a partial award of damages and/or injunctive relief to
either party. The Company has not accrued for any potential
losses in this case because it believes that an adverse
determination is not probable, and potential losses cannot be
reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company’s financial
statements include a $10 million advance payment from
Applied Biosystems that would have been deducted from the
profits otherwise payable to the Company from Applied Biosystems
had the collaboration been successful and which could offset the
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
of an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount.
However, any unfavorable arbitration determination, and in
particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by
the Company or prohibition of the sale of its products or
services, could result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

The Company is in the early stages of proceedings
in the patent case. In February 2004, the federal district court
in Northern California ordered that the patent case be stayed
pending completion of the arbitration process. The Company
intends to vigorously defend against the claims alleged by
Applied Biosystems and continue to pursue its counterclaims
against Applied Biosystems. However, the Company cannot be sure
that it will prevail in these matters. Any unfavorable
determination, and in particular any significant cash amounts
required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of the
Company’s products or services, could result in a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Other Agreements

The Company is the recipient of a grant from the
National Institutes of Health covering its participation in the
International HapMap Project, which is a $100 million,
internationally funded successor project to the Human Genome
Project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that
may be used to perform disease-related research. The Company
could receive up to $9.1 million of funding for this
project which covers basic research activities, the development
of SNP assays and the genotyping to be performed on those
assays. The Company recognized revenue under this grant of
$3.7 million in 2003 and, as of the end of 2003, had
approximately $5.4 million of funding remaining related to
this project which is expected to be received in 2004, depending
on the actual amount of work that is performed by the Company.

Litigation Judgment

In June 2002, the Company recorded a
$7.7 million charge to cover total damages and estimated
expenses awarded by a jury related to a
termination-of-employment lawsuit. The Company believes that the
termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was
unsupported by evidence presented at the trial. The Company
plans to vigorously defend its position on appeal. A notice of

appeal in this case was filed on October 10,
2002, and the appeal process is ongoing. During the appeal
process, the court requires the Company to incur interest
charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case
is resolved. For the years ended December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002, the Company recorded litigation expense
of $756,000 and $352,000, respectively, for interest.

As a result of the Company’s decision to
appeal the ruling, the Company filed a surety bond with the
court equal to 1.5 times the judgment amount or approximately
$11.3 million. Under the terms of the bond, the Company is
required to maintain a letter of credit for 90% of the bond
amount to secure the bond. Further, the Company was required to
deposit approximately $12.5 million of marketable
securities as collateral for the letter of credit and
accordingly, these funds will be restricted from use for general
corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed. If a
judgment is due, the Company expects payment will occur within
12 to 18 months. In 2003, the Company reclassified the
restricted investments to long term on the balance sheet along
with the accrued litigation judgment.

Income Taxes

At December 28, 2003, the Company has
federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $69,475,000 and $27,008,000, respectively. The
federal and state tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in
2018 and 2006 respectively, unless previously utilized. The
Company also has federal and state research and development tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $3,116,000 and $2,586,000
respectively, which will begin to expire in 2018, unless
previously utilized.

Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the
Internal Revenue Code, annual use of the Company’s net
operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the
event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50%
within a three year period.

Significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets as of December 28, 2003 and
December 29, 2002 are shown below (in thousands). A
valuation allowance has been established as of December 28,
2003 and December 29, 2002 to offset the net deferred tax
assets as realization of such assets has not met the “more
likely than not” threshold required under FAS 109.
