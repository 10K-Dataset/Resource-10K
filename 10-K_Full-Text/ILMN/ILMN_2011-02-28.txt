PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of life
    science tools and integrated systems for the analysis of genetic
    variation and function. We were incorporated in California in
    April 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our
    principal executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre
    Drive, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is

(858) 202-4500.

Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a comprehensive
    line of genetic analysis solutions, with products and services
    that serve a broad range of highly interconnected markets,
    including sequencing, genotyping, gene expression, and molecular
    diagnostics. Our customers include leading genomic research
    centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and
    clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, agrigenomics, and consumer genomics companies.

Our broad portfolio of systems, consumables, and analysis tools
    are designed to simplify genetic analysis. This portfolio
    addresses a range of genomic complexity, price points, and
    throughputs, enabling researchers to select the best solution
    for their scientific challenge. In 2007, through our acquisition
    of Solexa, Inc., we acquired our proprietary sequencing by
    synthesis (SBS) technology that is at the heart of our
    leading-edge sequencing instruments. These systems can be used
    to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA)
    analyses on large numbers of samples. For more focused studies,
    our array-based solutions provide ideal tools to perform
    genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving
    single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and copy number
    variation (CNV) analyses, as well as gene expression profiling,
    and other DNA, RNA, and protein studies. To further enhance our
    genetic analysis workflows, in January 2011 we acquired
    Epicentre Technologies Corporation, a leading provider of
    nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes
    for sequencing and microarray applications. In 2010, through our
    acquisition of Helixis, Inc., we expanded our portfolio to
    include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one of the
    most widely used technologies in life sciences. Our new Eco
    Real-Time PCR System provides researchers with an affordable,
    full-featured system to perform targeted validation studies.

Our operating structure is divided into two business segments,
    the Life Sciences Business Unit and the Diagnostics Business
    Unit. During 2010, our Diagnostics Business Unit had limited
    business activity and, accordingly, operating results for both
    units are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating
    segment. At each reporting period end, we will reassess our
    reportable operating segments, particularly as we continue to
    develop our molecular diagnostics business.

Industry
    Background

Genetics
    Primer

The instruction set for all living cells is encoded in
    deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, with the complete set of DNA for
    any organism referred to as its genome. DNA contains small
    regions called genes, which comprise a string of nucleotide
    bases labeled A, C, G, and T, representing adenine, cytosine,
    guanine, and thymine, respectively. These nucleotide bases are
    present in a precise order known as the DNA sequence. When a
    gene is “expressed,” a partial copy of its DNA
    sequence — called messenger RNA (mRNA) — is
    used as a template



to direct the synthesis of a protein. Proteins in turn, direct
    all cellular function. The illustration below is a simplified
    gene expression schematic.

Variations among organisms are due in large part to differences
    in their DNA sequences. Changes caused by insertions, deletions,
    inversions, or duplications of nucleotide bases may result in
    certain genes becoming over-expressed (excessive protein
    production), under-expressed (reduced protein production), or
    silenced altogether, sometimes triggering changes in cellular
    function. These changes can be the result of heredity, but most
    often occur at random. The most common form of variation in
    humans is called a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which
    is a variation in a single position of a nucleotide base in a
    DNA sequence. Copy number variations (CNVs) occur when there are
    fewer or more copies of certain genes.

In humans, genetic variation accounts for many of the physical
    differences we see (height, hair, eye color, etc.). More
    importantly, these genetic variations can have medical
    consequences affecting disease susceptibility, including
    predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer,
    diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.
    They can also impact an individual’s response to certain
    drug treatments, causing them to respond well, not respond at
    all, or experience adverse side effects — an area of
    study known as pharmacogenomics.

Scientists are studying these variations and their consequences
    in humans, as well as a broad range of animals, plants, and
    microorganisms. Researchers investigating human, viral, and
    bacterial genetic variation are helping us to better understand
    the mechanisms of disease and develop more effective
    therapeutics and diagnostics. Greater insight into genetic
    variation in plants (e.g., food and biofuel crops) and animals
    (e.g., livestock and domestic animals) is enabling scientists to
    improve crop yields and animal breeding programs.

The methods for studying genetic variation and biological
    function include sequencing, SNP genotyping, CNV analysis, gene
    expression profiling, and gene regulation analysis, each of
    which is addressed by our breadth of products and services.

Life
    Sciences Research Primer

Life science research encompasses the study of all living
    things, from humans, animals, and plants, to viruses and
    bacteria. It is being performed in government, university,
    pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrigenomics laboratories
    around the world, where scientists are seeking to expand our
    knowledge of the biological functions essential for life.
    Beginning at the genetic level, where our tools are used to
    elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological
    processes, life science research expands to include the study of
    the cells, tissues, organs, systems, and other components that
    make up living organisms. This research



supports development of new, more effective clinical diagnostics
    and medicines to improve human health, as well as advances in
    agriculture and animal husbandry to meet the world’s
    growing needs for food and energy.

Molecular
    Diagnostics Primer

Molecular diagnostic assays (or tests) are designed to identify
    the biological indicators linked with disease and drug
    metabolism, providing physicians with information to more
    effectively diagnose, treat, and monitor both acute and chronic
    disease conditions. They are an integral part of personalized
    healthcare, where the unique makeup of each individual will be
    taken into account in diagnosing disease and managing treatment
    through the use of more tailored therapies. Biological
    indicators that can be measured by these assays include protein
    or gene expression, methylation levels, copy number variations,
    and the presence or absence of a specific gene or group of genes.

There are molecular diagnostic assays on the market for
    infectious disease, cancer, and heart disease, as well as
    molecular-based drug metabolism assays to help physicians select
    the most effective therapy with the fewest side effects. Our
    innovative technologies and products are contributing to the
    development of a wide-range of potential molecular diagnostic
    assays. Our own efforts in this area are currently focused on
    the identification of certain genetic markers with potential
    diagnostic and therapeutic utility.

Growing news coverage about the clinical relevance of newly
    discovered genetic markers has prompted consumers’ interest
    in having their personal genomes analyzed, sparking the
    development of the consumer genomics market. We believe there
    are distinct medical benefits, especially for people with family
    histories of certain diseases, of knowing your disease
    predisposition. Several companies, including Illumina, now offer
    personal sequencing or genotyping services, working with
    physician groups and genetic counselors to interpret the results
    for consumers.

We believe the growth in consumer genomics and the use of
    molecular diagnostic assays will trigger a fundamental shift in
    the practice of medicine and the economics of the pharmaceutical
    industry by facilitating an increased emphasis on preventative
    and predictive molecular medicine, ushering in the era of
    personalized medicine.

Our
    Principal Markets

From the company’s inception, we have believed that the
    analysis of genetic variation and function will play an
    increasingly important role in molecular biology, and that by
    empowering genetic analysis, our tools will advance disease
    research, drug development, and the creation of molecular tests.
    In addition to developing sequencing- and array-based solutions
    for life science, applied, and consumer genomics markets, we are
    making inroads into the emerging market of molecular diagnostics.

Life
    Sciences Research Market

The life sciences research market consists of laboratories
    generally associated with universities, medical research
    centers, government institutions, as well as biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical companies. Researchers at these institutions are
    using our products and services in a broad spectrum of
    scientific activities, such as: next-generation sequencing,

mid-to-high-complexity

genotyping and gene expression (for whole-genome discovery and
    profiling), and low complexity genotyping and gene expression
    (for high-throughput targeted screening). DNA sequencing is
    growing the most rapidly among these three areas due to the
    creation of next-generation sequencing technologies, such as
    SBS. It is fueled by private and public funding, new global
    initiatives to broadly characterize genetic variation, and the
    migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencing-based
    technologies.

Applied
    Markets

We provide products and services for various other markets,
    which we refer to as “applied markets.” The largest
    among these is the “Agbio” market, where government
    and corporate researchers use our sequencing- and array-based
    tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research. For
    example, we currently offer



microarrays that contain SNPs for custom and focused genotyping
    of seeds and crops (such as maize) and livestock (such as
    cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep). Customers use them to perform
    selective breeding, accelerating and enhancing the process over
    traditional methods such as cross-breeding.

Molecular
    Diagnostics Market

Molecular diagnostics makes up the fastest growing segment in
    the clinical diagnostics market, with the primary growth drivers
    being the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven
    clinical utility, the increasing adoption of genetic-based
    diagnostic tests, and the expansion of reimbursement programs to
    include a greater number of approved molecular diagnostic tests.
    We believe our BeadXpress instrument platform, using our
    VeraCode technology, is ideally suited to provide a
    cost-effective, high-throughput, mid- to low-multiplex solution
    to the molecular diagnostic market. In April 2010, we obtained
    510(K) approval for the BeadXpress platform from the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We have initiated
    development of a variety of clinical diagnostic testing panels
    for this platform and are continuing research into the potential
    development of cancer diagnostic panels, initially focusing on
    ovarian, gastric, and colorectal cancers. During the fourth
    quarter of 2009, we made an FDA pre-IDE (investigational device
    exemption) submission for a cytogenetics test intended to be
    used on our iScan instrument platform as an aid in the postnatal
    diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated
    with developmental delay and mental retardation. Following
    completion of the required clinical trial, we intend to seek FDA
    clearance for the iScan instrument platform and related
    consumables.

Consumer
    Genomics Markets

New sequencing and genotyping technologies, such as those
    developed by Illumina, are driving down the cost of performing
    analyses which are increasingly valuable in diagnosing disease
    and evaluating disease risk. Consumer genomics is a nascent
    market, but one we believe has the potential for high growth as
    the cost per analysis continues to drop. In June 2009, we
    launched our Individual Genome Sequencing Service, the first
    physician-intermediated personal genome sequencing service for
    consumers. Built around physician-patient consultation, the
    service requires a physician’s order to initiate the
    process, with genome sequencing performed using our
    CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory. We have established
    collaborations with partners to perform the secondary data
    analysis of a personal genome (such as calculation of disease
    risk, ancestry, and information on traits of interest). Some of
    our partners, as well as other companies in the

direct-to-consumer

market, use our genotyping technology and products to perform
    personal genotyping services.

Our
    Principal Technologies

Our unique technology platforms enable the scale of
    experimentation necessary for genome-wide discovery, target
    selection, and validation studies (see Figure 1 below). More
    than 2,500 customer-authored scientific publications have been
    published to date using these technologies, representing the
    efforts of a large and dynamic Illumina user community. Through
    rapid innovation, we believe we are changing the economics of
    genetic research, enabling projects once considered
    unapproachable to now be within reach of more investigators.



Figure 1: Illumina Platform Overview:

Sequencing
    Technology

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of
    nucleotide bases (A, C, G, or T) in a DNA sample. Our HiSeq
    2000, HiSeq 1000, Genome Analyzer IIx, and HiScanSQ systems
    represent a family of systems that we believe are setting the
    standard for productivity, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy
    among next-generation sequencing technologies. They are used by
    customers to perform whole-genome, de novo, and targeted
    re-sequencing of genomes, and to analyze specific gene regions
    and genes. In January 2011, we announced the MiSeq Personal
    Sequencing System, which will expand our family of sequencing
    systems to include a low-cost personal sequencing system that
    will provide individual researchers a sequencing platform that
    can go from purified DNA to analyzed data in as few as eight
    hours or can generate in excess of 1 gigabase (Gb) per run in
    slightly over a day.

Whole-genome sequencing determines an organism’s complete
    DNA sequence. In de novo sequencing, the goal is to sequence a
    representative sample from a species never before sequenced. In
    targeted re-sequencing, a sequence of nucleotide bases is
    compared to a standard or reference sequence from a previously
    sequenced species to identify changes that reflect genetic
    variation. Understanding the similarities and differences in DNA
    sequence between and within species furthers our understanding
    of the function of the structures encoded in the DNA.

Our DNA sequencing technology is based on our proprietary
    reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry, referred to as
    sequencing by synthesis (SBS) biochemistry. In SBS, single
    stranded DNA is extended from a priming site, one base at a
    time, using reversible terminator nucleotides. These are DNA
    bases that can be added to a growing second strand, but which
    initially cannot be further extended. This means that at each
    cycle of the chemistry, only one base can be added. Each base
    that is added includes a fluorescent label that is specific to
    the particular base (A, C, G, or T). Following incorporation,
    the emitted light can be imaged to determine its color and thus
    determine the base. Once this is done, an additional step
    removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had
    prevented further extension of the second



strand. This allows another base to be added, and the cycle can
    then be repeated. Our technology is capable of generating over
    600 billion bases of DNA sequence from a single experiment
    with a single sample preparation. Key aspects of the SBS
    chemistry are the subject of significant intellectual property
    owned by us.

In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on
    microscopic clusters of DNA. Each cluster starts as a single DNA
    molecule fragment, typically a few hundred bases long, attached
    to the inside surface of a flow cell. We then use a proprietary
    amplification biochemistry to create copies of each starting
    molecule. As the copies are made, they are covalently linked to
    the surface, so they cannot diffuse away. After a number of
    cycles of amplification, each cluster might have approximately
    1,000 copies of the original starting molecule, but still be
    only about a micron (one-millionth of a meter) in diameter. By
    making so many copies, the fluorescent signal from each cluster
    is significantly increased. Because the clusters are so small,
    hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed
    inside a single flow cell. This large number of clusters can
    then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of SBS
    biochemistry and fluorescent imaging. Sequence reads are
    analyzed using specially developed data analysis software.

With the ability to generate over 600 Gb of DNA sequence per
    run, our SBS sequencing technology provides researchers with the
    broadest range of applications and the opportunity to sequence
    even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years.
    Since the launch of our first Genome Analyzer in 2007, our
    systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a
    factor of 100.

BeadArray
    Technology

Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a
    substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce
    arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously, enabling
    large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective, and
    flexible manner. The arrays manufactured using BeadArray
    technology are imaged by our iScan and HiScanSQ systems for a
    broad range of DNA and RNA analysis applications including SNP
    discovery, SNP genotyping, CNV analysis, gene expression
    analysis, and methylation analysis.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology consists of microscopic
    silica beads, each bead covered with hundreds of thousands of
    copies of oligonucleotides, or oligos, that act as the capture
    sequences in one of our assays. We deploy our BeadArray
    technology on BeadChips; silicon wafers the size of a microscope
    slide, with varying numbers of sample sites per slide. BeadChips
    are chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for
    each sample site.

We create unique bead pools, or sensors, for different DNA and
    RNA analysis applications by affixing thousands to millions of
    copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide molecule to each of
    the billions of microscopic beads in a batch. We make different
    batches of beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with
    one particular type of molecule. The particular molecules on a
    bead define that bead’s function as a sensor. To form an
    array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact with the
    array surface where they are randomly drawn into the wells, one
    bead per well. Because the beads assemble randomly into the
    wells, we perform a final procedure called “decoding”
    to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array.
    We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, which is a
    process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads
    in the array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding process
    is a functional validation of each bead in the array. This
    quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead
    and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure
    that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by
    including multiple copies of each bead type. Multiple bead type
    copies improve the reliability and accuracy of the resulting
    data by allowing statistical processing of the results of
    identical beads.

An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA,
    and introducing it to the array. The molecules in the sample
    bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads. The
    molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with
    fluorescent dye either before or after the binding, which can be
    detected by shining a laser on the BeadChip. This allows the
    detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis
    of the sample.



Using our BeadArray technology, we achieve high-throughput
    analysis with a high density of test sites per array, and are
    able to format arrays in various configurations. We seek to
    maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive
    consumables and valuable samples and through the low
    manufacturing costs associated with our technologies. Our
    ability to vary the size, shape, and format of the well patterns
    and to create specific bead pools for different applications
    provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market
    segments. These features enable our BeadArray technology to be
    applied to high-growth markets of SNP genotyping and CNV
    analysis, and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene
    expression market.

VeraCode
    Technology

Our proprietary VeraCode technology is a detection method for
    multiplex assays that require high precision, accuracy, and
    speed. When deployed on our BeadXpress Reader System, VeraCode
    technology provides a high-throughput solution for biomarker
    research and validation, pharmaceutical development, industrial
    and agriculture testing, clinical research, forensics, and
    molecular diagnostic assay development.

The VeraCode technology platform leverages the power of digital
    holographic codes to provide a detection method for multiplex
    assays. VeraCode enables low-cost multiplexing from 1 to
    384-plex in a single well. The VeraCode technology consists of
    cylindrical glass beads (measuring 240 microns in length by 28
    microns in diameter) inscribed with a unique digital holographic
    code to designate and track the specific analyte or genotype of
    interest throughout the multiplex reaction. When excited by a
    laser, each VeraCode bead emits a unique code image, allowing
    for quick and specific detection by the BeadXpress Reader System.

Depending on the desired multiplex levels, assays are created by
    pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several
    hundred. Unlike traditional microarrays, the VeraCode microbeads
    are used in solution, which takes advantage of solution-phase
    kinetics for more rapid hybridization times, dramatically
    reducing the time to achieve results.

In December 2009, we began offering VeraCode Universal Capture
    and Carboxyl Beads as General Purpose Reagents (GPRs). These
    royalty-free VeraCode GPR Beads provide customers with a
    flexible, high-quality, cost-effective multiplexing platform to
    develop their own custom multiplex assays for genotyping, CNV,
    gene expression, methylation, and protein analysis studies.

Eco
    Real-Time PCR Technology

In April 2010, we purchased Helixis, Inc. and its novel
    real-time PCR technology, and in July 2010 introduced the Eco
    Real-Time PCR System to the market. Real-Time PCR (also known as
    quantitative PCR or qPCR) is used to amplify and simultaneously
    quantify a targeted DNA molecule, with applications in gene
    expression, viral quantification, array data validation,
    pathogen detection, and genotyping. The procedure follows the
    same steps as PCR, whereby thermal cycling (alternately heating
    and cooling the DNA sample from 20 to 40 times) causes the DNA
    to self-replicate, resulting in the doubling of DNA product with
    each cycle. Real-time PCR uses various fluorescent detection
    chemistries to enable the monitoring of the PCR reaction as it
    progresses. Data are collected at each cycle rather than at the
    end of the reaction, providing higher precision, increased
    sensitivity, increased dynamic range, and higher resolution.

The Eco System combines a proprietary thermal system, four-color
    multiplex capabilities, and a fine-tuned optical system to
    deliver accurate qPCR results. Its unique design provides
    superior thermal uniformity, supporting high-quality PCR
    performance for demanding applications such as high resolution
    melt (HRM) curve analysis used for SNP genotyping, DNA
    fingerprinting, species identification, HLA compatibility
    typing, allelic prevalence, and DNA methylation analysis.
    Measuring just over one cubic foot in size, we believe the Eco
    System’s overall performance rivals larger, more expensive
    systems and provides us with a highly differentiated entry into
    this market.



Our
    Products

Using our proprietary technologies, our products give our
    customers the ability to analyze the genome at any level of
    complexity, from whole-genome sequencing to low-multiplex
    assays, and enable us to serve a number of markets, including
    research, agriculture, forensics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular
    diagnostics.

The majority of our product sales consist of instruments and
    consumables (which include reagents, flow cells, and BeadChips)
    based on our proprietary technologies (see Figure 2 below). For
    the fiscal years ended January 2, 2011, January 3,
    2010, and December 28, 2008, instrument sales comprised
    36%, 34%, and 32%, respectively, of total revenues, and
    consumable sales represented 56%, 59%, and 58%, respectively, of
    total revenues.

Figure 2: Illumina Product Introduction Timeline:

Based on our proprietary SBS technology, our next-generation
    sequencing platforms are designed to meet the workflow, output,
    and accuracy demands of a full range of sequencing applications.
    Designed for high-throughput (up to 600 Gb per run and up to 80
    Gb per day) sequencing, the HiSeq 2000 is fast, easy-to-use, and
    cost-effective, generating the sequence of two human genomes per
    run at 30× coverage for less than $5,000 (USD) in
    consumable cost per genome. Offering the same cost per data
    output and user experience, the HiSeq 1000 accommodates lower
    throughput needs, with an easy upgrade path to the HiSeq 2000.
    The Genome Analyzer IIx offers the simplest and fastest workflow
    for medium to high-throughput applications, generating up to 95
    Gb per run. Introduced in January 2011, with first customer
    shipments expected mid-2011, our MiSeq Personal Sequencing
    System delivers the fastest time to an answer (as little as
    eight hours) and offers a breadth of sequencing applications in
    a compact and economical instrument to meet the needs of
    individual researchers.

Sequencing/Array
    Combination Platforms

The HiScanSQ combines our SBS sequencing technology and iScan
    microarray analysis instrumentation into one system, with a
    modular design that can evolve with changing research needs.
    This flexible system allows researchers to use our sequencing
    and array technologies interactively to bring increased power to
    their experiments.

Array
    Platforms

The iScan System is our dedicated array scanner that supports
    the rapid, sensitive, and accurate imaging of our array-based
    genetic analysis products. It incorporates high-performance
    lasers, optics, and detection systems, delivering

sub-micron

resolution and unmatched throughput rates. The iScan supports
    our Infinium, GoldenGate, DASL, gene expression, and methylation
    assays. Our BeadXpress Reader is designed for both small and
    high-throughput laboratories conducting molecular testing with
    multiplexed-based assays deployed on our VeraCode bead
    technology. It supports a wide range of applications, including
    DNA, RNA, and protein-based assays, and is FDA cleared for
    in vitro diagnostics with specific VeraCode FDA-cleared
    tests.



Consumables

Our InfiniumHD Whole-Genome BeadChips represent our most
    technologically advanced multi-sample DNA analysis microarrays,
    enabling the interrogation of up to 2.5 million markers per
    sample, depending on the BeadChip. The most recent additions to
    the Omni family, the HumanOmni2.5 and HumanOmni1S BeadChips,
    provide comprehensive coverage of common and rare variants
    identified by the 1000 Genomes Project for performing rich GWAS
    projects. This product line also includes agriculturally
    relevant genome panels such as the BovineHD and MaizeSNP50
    BeadChips.

For researchers who want to study focused genomic regions of
    interest, or are interested in organisms for which there are no
    standard products, we offer iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChips.
    Easily developed to fit any experimental design, these SNP
    genotyping arrays can be used to investigate from 3,000 to
    1,000,000 markers targeting any species.

Our GoldenGate Universal-32 Sample BeadChip provides a flexible
    customized solution for mid-plex genotyping assays performed on
    the iScan System or HiScan, while the VeraCode GoldenGate
    genotyping arrays are well-suited for low-plex genotyping on the
    BeadXpress Reader.

We have developed a variety of sample preparation and sequencing
    kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis. Some provide
    all the necessary consumables needed for analyses, such as our
    Standard Sequencing Kit (SBS chemistry on our sequencing
    platforms) and Infinium Assay Kit (array-based genotyping on the
    iScan System). Others support more discrete analyses, such as
    our Paired-End Genomic DNA Sample Prep Kit for streamlining
    library preparation for the generation of 200 — 500 kb
    insert paired-end reads for sequencing, gene expression, and
    epigenetic analysis. Our new TruSeq SBS Sequencing Kit enhances
    sequencing studies with our HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 1000, Genome
    Analyzer IIx and MiSeq systems, by enabling researchers to
    extend the read lengths, achieve higher Gb of mappable data, and
    deliver the highest yield of perfect reads to maximize the
    ability to accurately characterize the genome. Through our
    recent acquisition of Epicentre Technologies Corporation, we
    acquired the proprietary Nextera technology for next-generation
    sequencing library preparation. This technology will enable us
    to offer sequencing library preparation kits with lower sample
    input requirements that greatly simplify genetic analysis
    workflows (from 12 hours and 9 steps, to 2 hours and 4
    steps) and significantly reduce the time from sample preparation
    to answer.

Real-time
    PCR Platforms

The Eco Real-Time PCR System provides fast, accurate qPCR
    results. Its icon-driven user interface simplifies experimental
    design and setup, while a straightforward workflow streamlines
    operation, enabling the system to perform qPCR on 48 samples in
    less than 40 minutes. As our first entry into the qPCR market,
    we believe the smaller, lower-cost, full-featured Eco System
    will enable more scientists to use real-time PCR technology in
    their research.

Our
    Services

In addition to the products we supply to customers, we also
    provide sequencing and genotyping services through our
    CLIA-certified, CAP accredited laboratory.

FastTrack
    Services

One of the ways in which we compete and extend the reach of our
    systems in the genetic analysis market is to deliver FastTrack
    Services that leverage our proprietary technologies and the
    expertise of our scientists to perform genotyping and sequencing
    services for our customers. We began offering genotyping
    services to academic institutions, biotechnology, and
    pharmaceutical customers in 2002. The in-house molecular
    geneticists that make up our FastTrack Genotyping team help
    customers perform GWAS projects, linkage analysis, and fine
    mapping studies to meet their deadlines, employing a range of
    our products, including standard and custom GoldenGate, standard
    Infinium and Infinium HD, and iSelect Infinium assays. These
    projects range in size from a few hundred to over 10,000 samples.



After five years of building an infrastructure to support
    genotyping services, we expanded to deliver sequencing services
    in 2007. We continue to combine the power of our proprietary SBS
    technology with the consultative and analytical capabilities of
    our FastTrack Sequencing team to execute high-value projects
    such as whole-genome sequencing, targeted resequencing, digital
    expression profiling, and small RNA discovery. Projects range
    from small sample sets requiring as little as one run, to
    large-scale projects such as de novo whole-genome sequencing
    that demand multiple instruments running in parallel for
    extended periods of time.

Service
    Partnership Programs

To complement our own service capabilities, we have developed
    partnered programs such as our Certified Service Providers
    (CSPro) and Illumina Genome Network (IGN) to create a world-wide
    network of Illumina technology-enabled service offerings that
    broaden our market reach. Illumina CSPro is a collaborative
    service partnership established between Illumina and leading
    genome centers and research laboratories to ensure the delivery
    of high-quality genetic analysis services. It provides a
    competitive advantage for service providers, while also ensuring
    that customers will receive Illumina data quality and service.
    To become a CSPro provider, participating laboratories must
    complete an Illumina certification process and undergo
    recertification on an annual basis. There are over 50 Illumina
    CSPro-certified organizations worldwide providing sequencing,
    genotyping, and gene expression services using our technologies
    and products.

Introduced in July 2010, the IGN links researchers interested in
    conducting large whole genome sequencing projects with leading
    institutes worldwide that possess our next-generation sequencing
    technology. IGN provides a cost-effective and dependable way to
    complete large sequencing projects. The genome sequencing
    service network comprises CSPro-certified academic and
    commercial organizations possessing 10 or more HiSeq 2000 or
    Genome Analyzer systems and committed to providing
    industry-leading turnaround times of as few as 12 weeks for
    50 samples. Current members include the National Center for
    Genome Resources (NCGR) in Santa Fe, New Mexico and the
    Macrogen Genomic Medicine Institute in Seoul, Korea.

Individual
    Genome Sequencing

Introduced in June 2009, Illumina’s Individual Genome
    Sequencing Service provides personal genome sequencing for
    consumers. It is performed in our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited
    laboratory using our next-generation sequencing technology. The
    service is built around physician-patient consultation, with a
    physician’s order required to initiate the process. The
    offering includes sequencing of an individual’s DNA to
    30-times depth, providing information on SNP variation and other
    structural characteristics of the genome such as insertions,
    deletions, and rearrangements. We are collaborating with a
    number of partners to provide secondary data analysis such as
    calculation of disease risk, ancestry, and information on traits
    of interest. The service requires individuals to follow our
    physician-mediated process, which involves pre-service
    consultation, patient consent, and a

seven-day

“cooling off” period during which the patient may
    withdraw consent. The final genome data is returned to the
    physician, who in turn delivers it to the consumer.

Intellectual
    Property

We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio, including,
    as of February 1, 2011, ownership of, or exclusive licenses
    to, 214 issued U.S. patents and 197 pending
    U.S. patent applications, including seven allowed
    applications that have not yet issued as patents. Our issued
    patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays,
    assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing technology, instruments, and
    chemical detection technologies, and have terms that expire
    between 2011 and 2029. We continue to file new patent
    applications to protect the full range of our technologies. We
    have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these
    patents and applications in foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright, and
    trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
    innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
    our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
    ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
    processes, to preserve our trade secrets, to enforce our
    patents, copyrights and trademarks, to operate without
    infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and to
    acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.



We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
    agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant
    us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing
    technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent
    kits, and scanning equipment. We have exclusive licenses from
    Tufts University to patents that are directed to our BeadArray
    technology. These patents were filed by Dr. David Walt, who
    is a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our
    Scientific Advisory Board, and one of our founders. Our
    exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying
    patents, which will occur between 2011 and 2020. We have
    additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third
    parties for other components of our products. In most cases, the
    agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying
    patents, may be terminated at our request without further
    obligation, and require that we pay customary royalties while
    the agreement is in effect.

Research
    and Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
    since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
    scientists and engineers who are specialists in biology,
    chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
    software, manufacturing, and other related areas required to
    complete the development of our products. Our research and
    development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
    to optimize our sequencing, BeadArray, VeraCode, and oligo
    synthesis technologies and to support commercialization of the
    products and services derived from these technologies.

Our research and development expenses for 2010, 2009, and 2008
    (inclusive of charges relating to share-based compensation of
    $25.4 million, $20.0 million, and $14.1 million,
    respectively) were $177.9 million, $140.6 million, and
    $100.0 million, respectively. We expect research and
    development expense to increase during 2011 as we continue to
    expand our research and product development efforts.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
    life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving
    sequencing, SNP genotyping, and gene expression profiling. These
    experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research,
    including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug
    discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and
    animal and agricultural research. Our potential customers
    include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions,
    government laboratories, and clinical research organizations, as
    well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, and
    consumer genomics companies. The genetic analysis market is
    relatively new and emerging and its size and speed of
    development will ultimately be driven by, among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and biological
    function; and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
    North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific
    region. In each of these areas, we have dedicated sales,
    service, and application support personnel responsible for
    expanding and managing their respective customer bases. In
    addition, in certain markets within Europe, the Asia-Pacific
    region, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa we sell
    our products and provide services to customers through
    distributors that specialize in life science products. We expect
    to continue to increase our sales and distribution resources
    during 2011 and beyond as we launch a number of new products and
    expand the number of customers that can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture sequencing and array platforms, reagent kits,
    scanning equipment, and oligos. Our manufacturing capacity for
    consumables and instruments has grown during 2010 to support our
    increased



customer demand. We are also focused on continuing to enhance
    the quality and manufacturing yield of our BeadChips and flow
    cells, in particular. To continue to increase throughput and
    improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the
    complexity of our products, we are exploring ways to continue
    increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process.
    We adhere to access and safety standards required by federal,
    state, and local health ordinances, such as standards for the
    use, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances.

Raw
    Materials

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw
    materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and
    biochemical materials, and other supplies. We have multiple
    commercial sources for many of our components and supplies;
    however, there are some raw materials and components that we
    obtain from single source suppliers. To mitigate potential risks
    arising from single source suppliers, we believe that we can
    redesign our products for alternative components or use
    alternative reagents if required. In addition, while we
    generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we
    purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to
    protect our supply chain.

Competition

Although we believe that our products and services provide
    significant advantages over products and services currently
    available from other sources, we expect to continue to encounter
    intense competition from other companies that offer products and
    services for sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression, and
    molecular diagnostics markets. These include companies such as
    Affymetrix, Inc.; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Beckman Coulter,
    Inc.; Complete Genomics, Inc.; Helicos BioSciences Corporation;
    General Electric Company; Life Technologies Corporation; Luminex
    Corporation; Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.; QIAGEN
    N.V.; Roche Diagnostics Corp.; and Sequenom, Inc., among others.
    Some of these companies have or will have substantially greater
    financial, technical, research, and other resources and larger,
    more established marketing, sales, distribution, and service
    organizations than we do. In addition, they may have greater
    name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in
    some cases a larger installed base of systems. Each of these
    markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to
    emerge and the intensity of competition to increase. In order to
    effectively compete with these companies, we will need to
    demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost,
    and accuracy advantages over competing products.

Segment
    and Geographic Information

We are organized in two business segments, Life Sciences and
    Diagnostics. Our Life Sciences Business Unit includes all
    products and services related to the research market, namely the
    product lines based on our sequencing, BeadArray, VeraCode, and
    real-time PCR technologies. Our Diagnostics Business Unit
    focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics.
    During all periods presented, our Diagnostics Business Unit had
    limited activity. Accordingly, our operating results for both
    units are reported on an aggregate basis as one operating
    segment. We will begin reporting in two segments once revenues,
    operating profit or loss, or assets of the Diagnostics Business
    Unit exceed 10% of the consolidated amounts.

We currently sell our products to a number of customers outside
    the United States, including customers in other areas of North
    America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Shipments to
    customers outside the United States totaled
    $403.8 million, or 45% of our total revenue, during 2010,
    compared to $319.1 million, or 48%, and
    $293.2 million, or 51%, in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Sales to customers outside of the United States were
    generally denominated in U.S. dollars. In 2008, we
    reorganized our international structure to establish more
    efficient channels among product development, product
    manufacturing, and sales. The reorganization increased our
    foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the
    U.S. entity for management decisions, financial support,
    production assets, and inventory thereby making the foreign
    subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the
    U.S. entity’s operations. As a result, we reassessed
    the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and
    determined the subsidiaries are more U.S. dollar based,
    resulting in a U.S. dollar functional currency
    determination. We expect that sales to international customers
    will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue.
    See note “13. Segment Information,



Geographic Data, and Significant Customers” in
    Part II, Item 8, of this

Form 10-K

for further information concerning our foreign and domestic
    operations.

Backlog

Our backlog was $299.0 million and $227.6 million at
    January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively.
    Generally, our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as
    of the balance sheet date; however, we may allow customers to
    make product substitutions as we launch new products. The timing
    of shipments depends on several factors, including agreed upon
    shipping schedules, which may span multiple quarters, and
    whether the product is catalog or custom. We expect an estimated
    90% of the backlog as of January 2, 2011 to be shipped
    within the fiscal year ending January 1, 2012. Although we
    generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a
    customer, we may be required to defer the recognition of revenue
    even after title transfer depending on the specific arrangement
    with a customer and the applicable accounting treatment. A
    material portion of our backlog at January 2, 2011 is
    associated with a large order we received from one customer at
    the end of 2009 for which we are using operating lease
    accounting that requires us to recognize revenue over a period
    of three years with the majority of that revenue recognized in
    2011 and 2012.

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
    significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
    is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
    highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result,
    in part, of U.S. academic customers spending unused budget
    allocations before the end of the U.S. government’s
    fiscal year on September 30 of each year.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of our employees and the
    environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
    materials that subject us to a variety of federal, state, and
    local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
    we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and
    regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and
    fines should contamination of the environment or individual
    exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot
    predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the
    development of new laws and regulations, will affect our
    business operations or the cost of compliance.

Government
    Regulation

Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or
    approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis
    of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass
    products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of
    disease, such as molecular diagnostic products, regulation by
    governmental authorities in the United States and other
    countries will be a significant factor in the development,
    testing, production, and marketing of such products. Products
    that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending
    on their intended use, will be regulated as medical devices by
    the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may
    require either receiving clearance following a pre-market
    notification process, also known as a 510(k) clearance, or
    premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA prior to marketing.
    Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive
    and may involve considerable delay.

The shorter 510(k) clearance process, which generally takes from
    three to six months after submission, but can take significantly
    longer, may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new
    product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar
    product that has already been cleared by the FDA. The longer PMA
    process is much more costly, uncertain, and generally takes from
    nine months to two years after filing. Because we cannot ensure
    that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will be
    subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, or will
    ultimately be approved at all, the regulatory approval process
    for such products may be significantly delayed and may be
    significantly more expensive than anticipated. If we fail to
    obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining,
    regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we



develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully
    commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.

Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the
    imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any
    time during the development or marketing of our products, which
    may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or
    comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.

In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process
    required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and
    future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled
    as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such
    products are used or could be used, even without our consent,
    for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory
    authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to
    regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Employees

As of January 2, 2011, we had approximately
    2,100 employees. None of our employees is represented by a
    labor union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.
    Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to
    attract and retain employees. In addition, we employ a number of
    temporary and contract employees. We face competition in this
    regard from other companies, research and academic institutions,
    government entities, and other organizations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
    described below. In addition to the other information included
    in this

Form 10-K,

the following issues could adversely affect our operating
    results or our stock price.

We
    face intense competition, which could render our products
    obsolete, result in significant price reductions, or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we
    sell.

We compete with life sciences companies that design,
    manufacture, and market products for analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function and other applications using a
    wide-range of competing technologies. We anticipate that we will
    continue to face increased competition as existing companies
    develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the
    market with new technologies. One or more of our competitors may
    render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Some of our
    competitors have greater financial and personnel resources,
    broader product lines, a more established customer base, and
    more experience in research and development than we do.
    Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, which
    are our potential customers and strategic partners, could also
    develop competing products. We believe that customers in our
    markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial
    supplier of a particular product; therefore, it may be difficult
    to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased
    products from competitors. To the extent we are unable to be the
    first to develop or supply new products, our competitive
    position may suffer.

The market for molecular diagnostics products is currently
    limited and highly competitive, with several large companies
    already having significant market share, intellectual property
    portfolios, and regulatory expertise. Established diagnostic
    companies also have an installed base of instruments in several
    markets, including clinical and reference laboratories, which
    could deter acceptance of our products. In addition, some of
    these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies
    that provide them access to genetic information that may be
    incorporated into their diagnostic tests.

Our
    success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of
    markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
    sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries. The
    usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the
    availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying
    or treating disease. We are focusing on markets for analysis of
    genetic variation and



biological function, namely sequencing, genotyping, and gene
    expression profiling. These markets are new and emerging, and
    they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their
    full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation
    and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we
    are developing. Also, researchers may not be able to
    successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw
    genetic data into medically valuable information. For instance,
    demand for our microarray products may be adversely affected if
    researchers fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic
    variation, such as SNPs, and disease susceptibility through
    genome wide association studies. In addition, factors affecting
    research and development spending generally, such as changes in
    the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and
    pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs
    that provide funding to companies and research institutions,
    could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available
    or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner,
    demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we
    expect, and we may not be able to sustain profitability.

If the
    quality of our products does not meet our customers’
    expectations, then our reputation could suffer and ultimately
    our sales and operating earnings could be negatively
    impacted.

In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately
    address quality issues associated with our products and
    services, including defects in our engineering, design, and
    manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party
    components included in our products. Because our instruments and
    consumables are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may
    increase as we continue to introduce new products and services
    and as we rapidly scale up manufacturing to meet increased
    demand for our products and services. Although we have
    established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise
    from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we
    will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these
    issues and associated liabilities. In addition, identifying the
    root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting
    reagents and third-party components, may be difficult, which
    increases the time needed to address quality issues as they
    arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur.
    Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may
    incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for
    example, shipment holds, product recalls, and warranty or other
    service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our
    relationships with new or existing customers and adversely
    affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high
    quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our
    continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and
    commercializing new products.

Our target markets are characterized by rapid technological
    change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs,
    existing and emerging competition, strong price competition, and
    frequent new product introductions. Accordingly, our continued
    growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing
    new products and services, including improving our existing
    products and services, in order to address evolving market
    requirements on a timely basis. If we fail to innovate or
    adequately invest in new technologies, our products and services
    will become dated, and we could lose our competitive position in
    the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products
    offered by our competitors. We believe that successfully
    introducing new products and technologies in our target markets
    on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage
    because customers make an investment of time in selecting and
    learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch
    once that selection is made.

To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative
    products, or such products are not accepted in the market or
    suffer significant delays in development, we may lose market
    share to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible
    to regain. An inability, for technological or other reasons, to
    successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our
    growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.
    In the past, we have experienced, and are likely to experience
    in the future, delays in the development and introduction of new
    products. We cannot ensure that we will keep pace with the rapid
    rate of change in our markets or that our new products will
    adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace,



achieve market acceptance, or compete successfully with
    competing technologies. Some of the factors affecting market
    acceptance of new products and services include:

•

availability, quality, and price relative to competing products
    and services;

•

the functionality and performance of new and existing products
    and services;

•

the timing of introduction of the new product or service
    relative to competing products and services;

•

scientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of
    the new product or service;

•

citation of the new product or service in published research;

•

regulatory trends and approvals; and

•

general trends in life sciences research and applied markets.

We may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if
    sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations
    or the market requirements for our products change due to
    technical innovations in the marketplace.

If we
    do not successfully manage the development and launch of new
    products or services, including product transitions, our
    financial results could be adversely affected.

We face risks associated with launching new products and
    pre-announcing products and services when the products or
    services have not been fully developed or tested. If our
    products and services are not able to deliver the performance or
    results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a
    timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer. If we
    encounter development challenges or discover errors in our
    products late in our development cycle, we may delay our product
    launch date. In addition, we may experience difficulty in
    managing or forecasting customer reactions, purchasing
    decisions, or transition requirements or programs (such as
    trade-in programs) with respect to newly launched products (or
    products in development) relative to our existing products,
    which could adversely affect sales of our existing products. The
    expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product
    development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of
    our new products could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

Reduction
    or delay in research and development budgets and government
    funding may adversely affect our revenue.

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from genomic
    research centers, academic institutions, government
    laboratories, and clinical research organizations, as well as
    pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, and consumer
    genomics companies, and their capital spending budgets can have
    a significant effect on the demand for our products and
    services. These budgets are based on a wide variety of factors,
    including the allocation of available resources to make
    purchases, funding from government sources, the spending
    priorities among various types of research equipment, and
    policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary
    periods. Any decrease in capital spending or change in spending
    priorities of our customers could significantly reduce our
    revenue. Moreover, we have no control over the timing and amount
    of purchases by our customers, and as a result, revenue from
    these sources may vary significantly due to factors that can be
    difficult to forecast. Any delay or reduction in purchases by
    our customers or our inability to forecast fluctuations in
    demand could harm our future operating results.

We
    depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components
    and materials used in our products, and if shipments from these
    manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted, or if the
    quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our
    requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship
    our products in a timely manner, or at all.

The complex nature of our products requires customized,
    precision-manufactured, components and materials that currently
    are available from a limited number of sources, and, in the case
    of some components



and materials, from only a single source. If deliveries from
    these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if
    we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may
    not be able to obtain these components or materials timely or in
    sufficient quantities or qualities, or at all, in order to meet
    demand for our products. We may need to enter into contractual
    relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production
    of some of our products, or develop these capabilities
    internally, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to do this
    on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or on commercially
    reasonable terms. In addition, the lead time needed to establish
    a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may
    experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch
    to a new supplier. The time and effort required to qualify a new
    supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of
    resources, or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would
    negatively impact our operating results. Accordingly, we may not
    be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume
    manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all. In
    addition, the manufacture or shipment of our products may be
    delayed or interrupted if the quality of the components or
    materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our
    requirements. Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing
    process or in shipping our products could result in lost
    revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

If we
    are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop
    and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may
    not be able to launch or support our products in a timely
    manner, or at all.

We continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing capacity to
    meet the anticipated demand for our products. Although we have
    significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and we
    believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have
    adequate capacity to meet our business plan for 2011, there are
    uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing
    capabilities, and we may not be able to sufficiently increase
    our capacity in a timely manner. For example, manufacturing and
    product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates
    at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products. Also,
    we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer
    demand, especially as we introduce new products. As a result, we
    may experience difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator,
    and internal demand, in which case we could lose customers or be
    required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our
    products could decline. Additionally, in the past, we have
    experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality
    control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended
    production of certain products. Due to the intricate nature of
    manufacturing complex instruments, consumables, and products
    that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown
    manufacturing difficulties in the future that could
    significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to
    launch or sell these products (or to produce them economically),
    prevent us from achieving expected performance levels, or cause
    us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.

Additionally, we currently manufacture in a limited number of
    locations. Our manufacturing facilities are located in
    San Diego and Hayward, California; Singapore; and Little
    Chesterford, United Kingdom. These areas are subject to
    natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods. If
    a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities
    significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to
    fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our
    services, or develop new products.

Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are
    controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS). Additionally, the decoding process in
    our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage
    infrastructure. If either our LIMS system or our networks or
    storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of
    time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our
    products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving
    our expected shipments in any given period.

Our
    acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions of businesses or technologies.

As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products,
    services, and technologies, we have made, and may continue to
    make, acquisitions of technologies, products, or businesses.
    Acquisitions involve



numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial
    challenges, including the following, any of which could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results
    of operations:

•

difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies,
    products, and personnel;

•

lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies
    and cost-savings;

•

difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;

•

underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or
    business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;

•

negative near-term impacts on financial results after an
    acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;

•

the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic
    partners of acquired companies;

•

claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired
    companies or other third parties related to the transaction;

•

the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of
    additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial
    portions of our cash;

•

diversion of management’s attention and company resources
    from existing operations of the business;

•

inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;

•

the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological
    advancements, or

worse-than-expected

performance of acquired companies; and

•

assumption of, or exposure to, unknown contingent liabilities or
    liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately
    quantify.

In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses
    requires significant efforts and expense across all operational
    areas, including sales and marketing, research and development,
    manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. We
    cannot ensure that any of the acquisitions we make will be
    successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure
    to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from
    achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a
    reasonable time frame, or at all.

The
    timing and extent of funding provided by the American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition, or results of
    operations.

The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide
    stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic
    downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over
    $10 billion in funding was provided to the National
    Institute of Health to support the advancement of scientific
    research. A portion of the stimulus funding may support the
    analysis of genetic variation and biological function and have a
    significant positive impact on our business. If our customers
    are unable to obtain stimulus money they may reduce their
    research and development budgets resulting in a decrease in
    demand for our products. In addition, it is unclear what will
    happen to demand for our products after the stimulus funds from
    the Recovery Act have been allocated and spent. A decline in
    demand will reduce our revenues, which would adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Unfavorable
    global economic conditions could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general
    conditions in the global economy and in the global financial
    markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme
    volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A
    severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global
    financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our
    business, including, in particular, reductions or delays in
    planned improvements to healthcare systems, research and
    development funding, and purchases of our products and



services, or cost-containment efforts by governments and private
    organizations that could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the
    liquidity of our investment portfolio could be impaired such as
    when more than $50 million of auction rate securities that
    we held for investment became illiquid in February 2008 because
    their scheduled auctions failed. Furthermore, as is the case for
    almost any other business, we face the following risks from a
    severe or prolonged economic downturn:

•

severely limited access to financing over an extended period of
    time, which may limit our ability to fund our growth strategy,
    could result in a need to delay capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, or research and development projects;

•

losses from our investment portfolio or to a counterparty’s
    inability to fulfill its payment obligations;

•

inability to refinance existing debt at competitive rates,
    reasonable terms, or sufficient amounts; and

•

increased volatility or adverse movements in foreign currency
    exchange rates.

In addition, certain of our customers may face challenges
    gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result
    in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us.
    If that were to occur, our allowance for doubtful accounts and
    our days sales outstanding could increase. Additionally, these
    economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable
    to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized
    components, which would impair our ability to manufacture on
    schedule and at commercially reasonable costs. Suppliers may
    also extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due
    to capacity constraints or other factors.

An
    inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our
    operations could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

Our business has grown rapidly, with total revenues increasing
    from $73.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2006
    to $902.7 million for the year ended January 2, 2011
    and with the number of employees increasing from approximately
    375 to approximately 2,100 during the same period. We expect to
    continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to
    achieve our operating plans. The rapid expansion of our business
    and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our
    management and operational systems. Our ability to effectively
    manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to
    expend funds to enhance our operational, financial, and
    management controls, reporting systems, and procedures and to
    attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a
    global basis. If we are unable to

scale-up

and
    implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control
    systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter
    deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not
    be able to make available the products required to successfully
    commercialize our technology. Our future operating results will
    depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement
    and improve our research, product development, manufacturing,
    sales and marketing, and customer support programs, enhance our
    operational and financial control systems, expand, train, and
    manage our employee base, integrate acquired businesses, and
    effectively address new issues related to our growth as they
    arise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage
    our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully,
    and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

If we
    lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain
    additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our
    goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
    personnel, including Jay Flatley, our President and Chief
    Executive Officer. The loss of their services could adversely
    impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. In
    addition, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel
    with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological
    information processing, sales, marketing, and technical support.
    We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel
    with other life science companies, universities, and research
    institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.
    Competition for these individuals, particularly in the
    San Diego and San Francisco area, is intense, and the
    turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain
    management and scientific personnel would prevent us from
    pursuing collaborations or developing our



products or technologies. Additionally, integration of acquired
    companies and businesses can be disruptive, causing key
    employees of the acquired business to leave. Further, we use
    stock options and restricted stock units to provide incentives
    for our key personnel to remain with us and to align their
    interests with those of the Company by building long-term
    stockholder value. If our stock price decreases, the value of
    these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key
    employee’s incentive to stay.

Any
    inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies
    could harm our competitive position.

Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop
    proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and
    maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the
    United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
    intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
    our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
    The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
    rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
    many companies have encountered significant challenges in
    establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of
    the United States. These challenges can be caused by the absence
    of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of
    intellectual property rights outside of the United States.

The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
    sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries, including
    our patent position, generally are uncertain and involve complex
    legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our
    proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only
    to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by
    valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as
    trade secrets. In addition, certain patent applications in the
    United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents
    issue, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or
    patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by
    several months. We intend to apply for patents covering our
    technologies and products as we deem appropriate. However, our
    patent applications may be challenged and may not result in
    issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after
    they are issued. Questions as to inventorship or ownership may
    also arise. Any finding that our patents or applications are
    unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from
    practicing the related technology, and a finding that others
    have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and
    applications could require us to obtain certain rights to
    practice related technologies, which may not be available on
    favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, as issued patents
    expire, we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop
    competing products, and, as a result, we may lose revenue.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we
    obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
    practicing our technologies or from developing competing
    products. There is also the risk that others may independently
    develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
    patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us
    with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate lawsuits
    to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third
    party claims, which would be expensive, and, if we lose, may
    cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and
    reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore,
    these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel.

We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how
    protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and
    we have taken security measures to protect this information.
    These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for
    our trade secrets, know-how, or other confidential information.
    Among other things, we seek to protect our trade secrets and
    confidential information by entering into confidentiality
    agreements with employees, collaborators, and consultants. There
    can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we
    have with our employees, collaborators, and consultants will
    provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and
    confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in
    the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
    Accordingly, there also can be no assurance that our trade
    secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently
    developed by competitors.



Litigation,
    other proceedings, or third party claims of intellectual
    property infringement could require us to spend significant time
    and money and could prevent us from selling our products or
    services.

Our success depends, in part, on our non-infringement of the
    patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties
    have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing
    their proprietary technology without authorization. As we enter
    new markets, we expect that competitors will likely claim that
    our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part
    of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those
    markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in
    the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of
    our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur
    substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these
    claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in
    defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse
    impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the
    actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties making
    claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other
    relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop
    further, commercialize, or sell products or services, and could
    result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the
    event of a successful infringement claim against us, we may be
    required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from
    third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products or
    services. In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses
    at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur
    substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses
    obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our
    gross margins. In addition, we could encounter delays in product
    introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or
    products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of
    these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from
    commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of
    our products or services could adversely affect our ability to
    grow or maintain profitability.

Doing
    business internationally creates operational and financial risks
    for our business.

Conducting and launching operations on an international scale
    requires close coordination of activities across multiple
    jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management
    resources. If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities
    effectively, including the risks noted below, our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely
    affected. We are focused on expanding our international
    operations in key markets. We have sales offices located
    internationally throughout Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and
    Brazil as well as manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom
    and Singapore. During 2010, the majority of our sales to
    international customers and purchases of raw materials from
    international suppliers were denominated in U.S. dollars.
    Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 45%,
    48%, and 51% of our total revenue for the years ended
    January 2, 2011, January 3, 2010, and
    December 28, 2008, respectively. We intend to continue to
    expand our international presence by selling to customers
    located outside of the United States and we expect the total
    amount of

non-U.S. sales

to continue to grow.

International sales entail a variety of risks, including:

•

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts
    receivable outside of the United States;

•

longer sales cycles due to the volume of transactions taking
    place through public tenders;

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of
    foreign countries into which we sell our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other
    trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety
    of foreign laws.



Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the
    cost of certain items required in our operations. Changes in
    currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at
    which we are able sell products in the same market. Our revenues
    from international customers may be negatively impacted as
    increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international
    customers local currency could make our products more expensive,
    impacting our ability to compete. Our costs of materials from
    international suppliers may increase if in order to continue
    doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of
    the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency.
    Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could
    result in actions by the United States and other countries to
    offset the effects of such fluctuations. The recent global
    financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in
    foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may
    continue, which could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

We are
    subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions
    and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding
    convertible notes.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on
    interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required
    in determining the provision for income taxes. Our effective
    income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors,
    including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in
    tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
    existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of
    non-deductible expenses (including share-based compensation),
    changes in our future levels of research and development
    spending, mergers and acquisitions, or the result of
    examinations by various tax authorities. Although we believe our
    tax estimates are reasonable, if the IRS or other taxing
    authority disagrees with the positions taken by the Company on
    its tax returns, we could have additional tax liability,
    including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such
    additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could
    have a material impact on our results of operations and
    financial position.

In addition, we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for
    interest expense associated with our $390 million aggregate
    principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if these notes
    are not subject to the special Treasury Regulations governing
    contingent payment debt instruments, the notes are converted, or
    we invest in non-taxable investments.

Our
    products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject
    to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and
    maintenance process for such products may be expensive,
    time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in
    outcome.

Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or
    approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis
    of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass
    products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of
    disease, certain of our products are likely to become subject to
    regulation by the FDA, or comparable agencies of other
    countries, including requirements for regulatory approval of
    such products before they can be marketed. Such regulatory
    approval processes or clearances may be expensive,
    time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or
    comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, or operating
    results. In addition, changes to the current regulatory
    framework, including the imposition of additional or new
    regulations, could arise at any time during the development or
    marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our
    ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory
    approval of our products, if required.

Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their
    intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and
    comparable agencies of other countries and may require either
    receiving clearance from the FDA following a pre-market
    notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each
    case prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory
    approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.
    If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in
    obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic
    products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or
    successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or
    at all.



In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process
    required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and
    future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled
    as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such
    products are used or could be used, even without our consent,
    for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory
    authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to
    regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our
    operating results may vary significantly from period to period,
    and we may not be able to sustain operating
    profitability.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and services, the effects of new
    product launches and related promotions, the impact of seasonal
    spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our
    customers perform, the timing of our customers’ funding,
    changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences
    industry, and other unpredictable factors that may affect
    customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting
    the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services,
    we may experience

quarter-to-quarter

fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a
    sequential decline in quarterly revenue. While we anticipate
    future growth, there is some uncertainty as to the timing of
    revenue recognition on a quarterly basis. This is because a
    substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically
    recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the
    pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not
    linear, with a concentration of orders in the final week of the
    quarter. In light of that, our revenue cut-off and recognition
    procedures, together with our manufacturing and shipping
    operations, may experience increased pressure and demand during
    the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter.

A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed, including
    expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel. In addition,
    we expect operating expenses to continue to increase
    significantly in absolute dollars, and we expect that our
    research and development and selling and marketing expenses will
    increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the
    development and launch of new products. Accordingly, our ability
    to sustain profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of
    growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses,
    and if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able
    to maintain annual or quarterly profitability. Any significant
    delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable
    sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the
    other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future
    revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly
    revenue. In addition, non-cash share-based compensation expense
    and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also
    likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability.
    Due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our
    revenue and expenses, particularly from quarter to quarter, we
    believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are
    not a good indication of our future performance. If our
    operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of
    stock market analysts and investors, our stock price could
    decline.

From time to time, we receive large orders that have a
    significant effect on our operating results in the period in
    which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such
    orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue
    recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes
    in net sales. As a result, our operating results could vary
    materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such
    orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.

Changes
    in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates,
    and judgments by management related to complex accounting
    matters could significantly affect our financial results or
    financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting
    pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations
    with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our
    business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair
    value determinations, inventories, business combinations and
    intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex
    and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and
    judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or
    changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could
    significantly change our reported or expected financial
    performance or financial condition.



Ethical,
    legal, and social concerns related to the use of genetic
    information could reduce demand for our products or
    services.

Our products may be used to provide genetic information about
    humans, agricultural crops, and other living organisms. The
    information obtained from our products could be used in a
    variety of applications, which may have underlying ethical,
    legal, and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate
    uses of the resulting information, including the genetic
    engineering or modification of agricultural products or testing
    genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions.
    Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes,
    call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing
    or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain
    conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure.
    Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use
    genetics tests even if permissible. These and other ethical,
    legal, and social concerns about genetic testing may limit
    market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or
    reduce the potential markets for our technology, either of which
    could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

The
    relocation of our corporate headquarters, which is expected to
    begin in late 2011, could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into a lease
    agreement for a new corporate headquarters to meet our current
    and long-term expansion needs. We expect to begin relocating
    most of our San Diego-based operations to this new facility
    in late 2011. In addition to incurring a one-time non-cash
    charge of approximately $30 million related to the
    remaining lease obligations for our current corporate
    headquarters, we expect to incur additional expenses associated
    with the relocation itself. Although we expect to sublease our
    current corporate headquarters, we will continue to be subject
    to rent and lease obligations for our current facility through
    October 2023. Additional risks associated with the relocation,
    including, in particular, the relocation of oligo manufacturing
    that currently takes place at our corporate headquarters, may
    include delays in receiving necessary permits and approvals and
    business disruption as complex manufacturing equipment is moved.

Our
    strategic equity investments may result in losses.

We periodically make strategic equity investments in various
    public and private companies with businesses or technologies
    that may complement our business. The market values of these
    strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market
    conditions and other conditions over which we have no control.

Other-than-temporary

declines in the market price and valuations of the securities
    that we hold in other companies would require us to record
    losses in proportion to our ownership interest. This could
    result in future charges to our earnings. It is uncertain
    whether or not we will realize any long-term benefits associated
    with these strategic investments.

Conversion
    of our outstanding convertible notes may result in
    losses.

As of January 2, 2011, we had $390.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of convertible notes outstanding. The notes are
    convertible into cash, and if applicable, shares of our common
    stock under certain circumstances, including trading price
    conditions related to our common stock. If the trading price of
    our common stock remains significantly above the conversion
    price of $21.83 per share, we expect that noteholders will elect
    to convert the notes. Upon conversion, we are required to record
    a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the
    notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying
    value. The fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on
    our current incremental borrowing rate. The net carrying value
    of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 8.27%. If our
    incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower
    than the implied interest rate of the notes, we will record a
    loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period
    in which the notes are converted.

In December 2010, we agreed to lease a facility in
    San Diego, California that will serve as our new corporate
    headquarters, which includes facilities for research and
    development and manufacturing. The lease covers existing
    buildings with approximately 346,600 rentable square feet
    and an additional building with approximately
    123,400 rentable square feet to be built in the future. The
    lease has an initial term of 20 years. We excluded this
    lease from the table above as the lease will not commence until
    the second half of 2011. We plan to relocate from our present
    corporate headquarters to the new facility and expect the
    transition to begin during the fourth quarter of 2011.

Legal
    Proceedings.

From time to time, we are party to litigation and other legal

    conduct, of our business. While the results of any litigation or
    other legal proceedings are uncertain, management does not
    believe the ultimate resolution of any pending legal matters is
    likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position or results of operations.

    Performance Graph

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder
    returns on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with
    the cumulative total stockholder returns on the NASDAQ Composite
    Index and the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for the same period.
    The graph assumes that $100 was invested on January 1, 2006
    in our common stock and in each index and that all dividends
    were reinvested. No cash dividends have been declared on our
    common stock. Stockholder returns over the indicated period
    should not be considered indicative of future stockholder
    returns.

Holders

As of February 4, 2011 we had 348 record holders of our
    common stock.

Dividends

We have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention
    to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition,
    the indenture for our convertible senior notes due 2014, which
    notes are convertible into



cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of our common stock,
    requires us to increase the conversion rate applicable to the
    notes if we pay any cash dividends.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities by the Issuer

In July 2010, our board of directors authorized a
    $200 million stock repurchase program, with
    $100 million allocated to repurchasing our common stock
    under a 10b5-1 plan over a 12 month period and
    $100 million allocated to repurchasing our common stock at
    management’s discretion during open trading windows. The
    following table summarizes shares repurchased pursuant to this
    program during the quarter ended January 2, 2011:

    consumer genomics companies.

Our broad portfolio of systems, consumables, and analysis tools
    are designed to simplify genetic analysis. This portfolio
    addresses the range of genomic complexity, price points, and
    throughputs, enabling researchers to select the best solution
    for their scientific challenge. In 2007, through our acquisition
    of Solexa, Inc., we acquired our proprietary sequencing by
    synthesis (SBS) technology that is at the heart of our
    leading-edge sequencing instruments. These systems can be used
    to efficiently perform a range of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA)
    analyses on large numbers of samples. For more focused studies,
    our array-based solutions provide ideal tools to perform
    genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving
    single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and copy number
    variation (CNV) analyses, as well as gene expression profiling
    and other DNA, RNA, and protein studies. To further enhance our
    genetic analysis workflows, in January 2011 we acquired
    Epicentre Technologies Corporation, a leading provider of
    nucleic acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes
    for sequencing and microarray applications. In 2010, through our
    acquisition of Helixis, Inc., we expanded our portfolio to
    include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), one of the
    most widely used technologies in life sciences. Our new Eco
    Real-Time PCR System provides researchers with an affordable,
    full-featured system to perform targeted validation studies.

We are organized in two business segments, the Life Sciences
    Business Unit and the Diagnostics Business Unit. During 2010,
    our Diagnostics Business Unit had limited business activity and,
    accordingly, operating results are reported on an aggregate
    basis as one operating segment. At each reporting period end, we
    reassess our reportable operating segments, particularly as we
    continue to develop our molecular diagnostics business.

Our analysis presented below is organized to provide the
    information we believe will be useful for understanding the
    relevant trends going forward. However, this discussion should
    be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
    statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 of this report.

Business
    Trends and Outlook

Our financial results have been, and will continue to be,
    impacted by several significant trends, which are described
    below. While these trends are important to understanding and
    evaluating our financial results, the other transactions,
    events, and trends discussed in “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1A of this report may also materially impact our
    business operations and financial results.

Next-Generation
    Sequencing

Growth in the sequencing market and enhancements in our product
    portfolio continue to drive both sequencing instrument and
    consumable sales. In Q1 2010, we began customer shipments of the
    HiSeq 2000, our newest high-throughput next-generation
    sequencing instrument. The HiSeq 2000 was developed over a
    three-year period and is designed to provide ultra-high
    sequencing throughput that will significantly lower the cost of
    sequencing. As a result of the launch, a substantial number of
    our customers who previously purchased the Genome Analyzer
    sequencing system ordered the HiSeq 2000 to replace their
    existing sequencer with this new system. As a result of strong
    demand, both from customers who desired to trade-in their
    existing Genome Analyzers and new customers who ordered the
    HiSeq 2000, our manufacturing capacity was constrained
    throughout all of 2010. During the year we significantly
    increased our manufacturing capacity for the HiSeq 2000 to meet
    growing demand. We now believe that we have increased our
    capacity to the point where we can begin reducing our backlog
    and fulfilling new orders in a more timely manner. Additionally,
    in the first half of 2011, we expect to further enhance the
    performance of the HiSeq 2000. We believe that these
    enhancements will enable customers to sequence whole human
    genomes for less than $5,000 in consumable costs. As we continue
    to make improvements that reduce the cost of sequencing we
    believe that more customers will use the HiSeq 2000, which
    generates more revenue per instrument time than the Genome
    Analyzer. We believe that this will increase our consumable
    pull-through, which is a measure of the annual consumable
    revenue generated from each instrument in the installed base.



In Q4 2011, we expect to begin volume customer shipments of our
    recently announced MiSeq, a low-cost personal sequencing system
    that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform
    with rapid turnaround time, high accuracy, and streamlined
    workflow. We believe the launch of the MiSeq will expand our
    presence in the lower throughput sequencing market.

Microarrays

As a complement to advances in sequencing technology, we believe
    microarrays offer a cheaper, faster, and more accurate
    technology for use when genetic content is known. The
    information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible. As
    such, microarrays provide repeatable, standardized assays for
    certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome.
    During 2010, microarray product sales increased as compared to
    2009, led by:

•

the launch of the Omni 2.5, a four sample BeadChip enabling
    interrogation of approximately 2.5 million markers per
    sample;

•

growth in sales of focused content arrays primarily from use for
    genetic screening in applied markets such as agriculture and
    fine mapping for follow up to GWAS projects; and

•

the launch of the HiScanSQ, our instrument that integrates
    next-generation sequencing with genotyping and gene expression
    arrays.

As additional new rare variant content becomes available from
    the 1000 Genomes Project, an international research effort
    launched in 2008 to establish the most detailed catalog of human
    genetic variation, we plan to launch a microarray that will
    feature approximately five million markers per sample. We expect
    to begin customer shipments of this product in mid-2011.
    However, the launch of this product will depend on the timing of
    the release of new content from the 1000 Genomes Project. We
    believe new product introductions as new content becomes
    available will continue to drive growth in the sales of our
    microarray products.

American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery
    Act)

The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide
    stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic
    downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over
    $10.0 billion in funding was provided to the National
    Institutes of Health (NIH) to support the advancement of
    scientific research. While it is not possible to precisely
    quantify the net impact of orders resulting from the Recovery
    Act due to the uncertainty surrounding orders that would have
    been received in absence of stimulus, we believe approximately
    $70.4 million in orders during 2010 were directly related
    to Recovery Act grants. We believe Recovery Act funds will
    continue to be spent by our customers through 2012.

Gross
    Margin

Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin)
    decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the effects of
    discounts provided to customers on the sales of HiSeq 2000s
    associated with promotional programs, including the Genome
    Analyzer trade-in program, and lower margins on our newer
    products, such as the HiSeq 2000. Over the course of 2011, we
    expect our gross margin to improve as the Genome Analyzer
    trade-in program is completed and sales of consumables, which
    generally carry a higher gross margin than instruments, increase
    as a percentage of total revenue. We also expect improved
    manufacturing efficiency for the HiSeq 2000 to improve gross
    margin in 2011.

Operating
    Expense

We expect to incur additional operating costs to support the
    expected growth in our business. We believe a substantial
    investment in research and development is essential to remain
    competitive and expand into additional markets. Accordingly, we
    expect our research and development expenses to increase in
    absolute dollars as we continue to expand our product base.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses are also



expected to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in staff
    and infrastructure to support top line growth and global
    expansion.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is dependent on the mix of
    earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates
    and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “We are
    subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions
    and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding
    convertible notes” in Item 1A of this

Form 10-K.

For 2011 and beyond, we anticipate increased earnings in higher
    tax jurisdictions, which may adversely impact the provision for
    income taxes.

Due to the expected utilization of the majority of our net
    operating loss carryforwards and U.S. federal research and
    development tax credit carryforwards, we anticipate significant
    income tax payments in 2011 and beyond.

Revenue

Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of
    consumables and instruments.

Consumable revenue increased $113.7 million, or 29%, to
    $505.0 million for 2010 compared to $391.3 million for
    2009. Microarray consumable revenue, which constituted more than
    half of our total consumable revenue, increased
    $28.3 million primarily attributable to growth in sales of
    our Infinium BeadChips, which constituted a majority of our
    microarray consumable sales. Sales volume of our Infinium
    BeadChip products increased on a per sample basis during 2010
    compared to 2009. The average selling price per sample, however,
    declined due to a change in product mix primarily attributable
    to growth in sales of our focused content arrays and a number of
    large sample volume purchase orders that incurred higher
    discounts. Revenue from sequencing consumables increased
    $85.4 million due to growth in the installed base of our
    sequencing systems.

Revenue from the sale of instruments increased
    $98.9 million, or 44%, to $324.6 million for 2010
    compared to $225.7 million for 2009. Sequencing instrument
    revenue increased $85.7 million. We experienced increases
    in both the number of units sold and average selling prices per
    unit for our sequencing systems during 2010 compared to 2009.
    Unit growth was due to increased demand for next-generation
    sequencing systems. The increase in average selling prices was
    primarily attributable to the launch of the HiSeq 2000 in Q1
    2010. Microarray instrument revenue increased $13.2 million
    primarily attributable to strong demand for our HiScanSQ
    instrument launched in 2010. The launch of this system resulted
    in increases in both the number of units sold and average
    selling prices per unit for our microarray instruments during
    2010 compared to 2009.

The increase in service and other revenue, which includes
    extended warranty contracts and genotyping and sequencing
    services, was primarily attributable to an increase in extended
    warranty contracts for our growing installed base of sequencing
    systems.

Gross
    Margin

The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the
    effect of discounts provided to customers on the sales of HiSeq
    2000 associated with promotional programs, including the Genome
    Analyzer trade-in program, and lower margins on our newer
    products, such as the HiSeq 2000. See “Revenue
    Recognition” in note “1. Organization and Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies” in Part II,
    Item 8, of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on the Genome Analyzer trade-in
    program. The impact of the promotional programs was partially
    offset by improved margins on sequencing consumables primarily
    attributable to improved overhead absorption from increased
    volumes and the benefit of decreased costs associated with
    chemistry improvements.

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily
    attributable to a $25.9 million increase in personnel
    expenses, including salaries, non-cash share-based compensation,
    and benefits, and an increase in other non-personnel expenses of
    $13.3 million comprised mostly of lab and production
    supplies expenses. These increases were primarily attributable
    to investments in new product development and commercialization
    along with projects to sustain and optimize our existing product
    portfolio.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was
    primarily attributable to a $31.8 million increase in
    personnel expenses, including salaries, non-cash share-based
    compensation, and benefits, associated with the growth of our
    business, and an increase in outside service expenses of
    $9.7 million comprised mostly of legal and marketing
    expenses.

During 2010, acquisition related (gain) expense, net, includes a
    gain of $10.4 million from a change in the fair value of
    contingent consideration related to an acquisition, partially
    offset by an acquired in-process research and development charge
    of $1.3 million related to a milestone payment made to the
    former shareholders of a company we acquired in 2008. During
    2009, acquisition related (gain) expense, net, included acquired
    in-process research and development charges of

Interest income decreased despite an increase in our average
    cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in
    interest rates during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in
    interest expense was due to the amortization of the discount on
    our convertible senior notes. The change in other (expense)
    income, net, was primarily attributable to a $13.2 million
    impairment charge recorded in Q4 2010 related to the impairment
    of a cost-method investment and a related note receivable (see
    note “5. Impairment” in Part II, Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K

for additional information on this impairment) partially offset
    by a $2.9 million gain recognized in Q2 2010 on the
    acquisition of Helixis, Inc., which represented the difference
    between the carrying value of our cost-method investment in
    Helixis, Inc. prior to acquisition and the fair value of that
    investment at the time of acquisition.

Revenue

Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of
    consumables and instruments.

Consumable revenue increased $57.6 million, or 17%, to
    $391.3 million for 2009 compared to $333.7 million for
    2008. Microarray consumable revenue, which constituted more than
    half of our consumable revenue, declined $11.4 million
    primarily attributable to lower sales of whole-genome genotyping
    arrays partially offset by growth in focused content arrays. The
    decline was driven by customers delaying the start of new GWAS
    in anticipation of new and rare variant content from the 1000
    Genome Project, order delays directly related to stimulus
    funding under the Recovery Act, and the impact of reduced
    foundation funding at a few key customers. Sales volume for our
    Infinium BeadChip product lines, which constituted a majority of
    our microarray consumable sales, was relatively flat on a sample
    basis during 2009 compared to 2008. The average selling price
    per sample, however, declined due to a change in product mix
    attributable to growth in the sales of our focused content
    arrays coupled with lower sales of whole-genome genotyping
    arrays.

Revenue from sequencing consumables increased $68.9 million
    driven by growth in the installed base of our Genome Analyzer
    systems and the progression of customer labs ramping to
    production scale. The increase was partially offset by a loss of
    sales related to a quality issue affecting our paired-end
    cluster kits that arose in September 2009 when some of our
    larger sequencing customers began experiencing higher than
    average error rates on the second read of their paired-end
    analysis. During the fourth quarter, we began shipping
    reformulated paired-end cluster kits at full capacity and
    cleared the related shipping backlog.

Revenue from the sale of instruments increased
    $40.0 million, or 22%, to $225.7 million for 2009
    compared to $185.7 million for 2008 primarily due to a
    $56.4 million increase in sales of our sequencing systems.
    During 2009 as compared to 2008 units sold and average
    selling prices increased for our Genome Analyzer systems, which
    constituted a majority of sequencing instrument revenue. The
    increase in units sold was driven by increased demand for
    next-generation sequencing systems. The increase in average
    selling prices was attributable to the product transition from
    the Genome Analyzer I to the Genome Analyzer II in the
    second quarter of 2008 and technological improvements leading to
    the launch of the Genome Analyzer IIx in the second quarter of
    2009. The increase in sequencing instrument revenue was
    partially offset by a $16.4 million decrease in the sales
    of our microarray systems, which declined primarily due to
    customers delaying the start of new GWAS in anticipation of new
    and rare variant content from the 1000 Genomes Project, order
    delays directly related to stimulus funding under the Recovery
    Act, and the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key
    customers.



Gross
    Margin

The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to lower
    costs for our sequencing consumables and instrumentation, a
    $4.1 million impairment charge recorded in 2008 for which
    there was no similar charge recognized in 2009, and a
    $3.8 million decrease in amortization expense. The gross
    margin on sequencing consumables increased primarily due to
    improved overhead absorption from increased volumes of
    sequencing consumables and the benefit of decreased costs
    associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits
    launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The gross
    margin on sequencing instruments increased primarily due to
    production efficiencies and reduced material costs coupled with
    higher average selling prices.

Operating
    Activities

Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 consists of net
    income of $124.9 million plus net non-cash adjustments of
    $149.8 million and a $2.1 million decrease in net
    operating assets. The primary non-cash expenses added back to
    net income included share based compensation of
    $71.6 million, depreciation and amortization expenses
    related to property and equipment and intangible assets of
    $42.0 million, and the amortization of the debt discount on
    our convertible notes totaling $21.4 million. The main
    drivers in the change in net operating assets included increases
    in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities. These increases were primarily related to the
    growth of our business.

Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 consists of net
    income of $72.3 million plus net non-cash adjustments of
    $115.7 million and an $15.8 million increase in net
    operating assets. The primary non-cash expenses added back to
    net income included share based compensation of
    $60.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense
    related to property and equipment, intangibles and the debt
    discount on our convertible notes totaling $51.5 million.

Investing
    Activities

Cash used in investing activities totaled $285.0 million in
    2010. During the year we:

•

purchased and sold

available-for-sale

securities totaling $846.2 million and $688.6 million,
    respectively;

•

paid net cash of $98.2 million for acquisitions;

•

sold trading securities totaling $54.9 million;

•

used $49.8 million for capital expenditures primarily
    associated with the purchase of manufacturing equipment and
    infrastructure for additional production capacity and rental and
    loaner instruments; and

•

made strategic investments totaling $27.7 million.



Cash used in investing activities totaled $256.6 million in
    2009. We purchased and sold

available-for-sale

securities totaling $694.5 million and $514.2 million,
    respectively. We incurred $52.7 million in capital
    expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our
    facilities and infrastructure at our San Diego, Hayward and
    UK locations.

Financing
    Activities

Cash provided by financing activities totaled
    $116.5 million in 2010. We received $118.0 million in
    proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through the
    exercise of stock options and warrants and under our Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan. We also received $42.4 million in
    incremental tax benefit related to stock options exercised.
    These increases were partially offset by common stock
    repurchases of $44.0 million.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $98.9 million in
    2009. During the year we repurchased approximately
    6.1 million shares of our common stock for
    $175.1 million, which was partially offset by
    $39.4 million in proceeds received from issuance of common
    stock through the exercise of stock options and under our
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We also received
    $39.3 million in incremental tax benefit related to stock
    options exercised.

Liquidity

We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the
    primary source of our liquidity. Our ability to generate cash
    from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we
    need to meet operating, investing, and financing needs.
    Historically, we have issued debt and equity securities to
    finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by
    operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs.

At January 2, 2011, we had approximately
    $894.3 million in cash and short-term investments. Our
    short-term investments include marketable securities consisting
    of debt securities in government sponsored entities, corporate
    debt securities, and U.S. treasury notes.

On February 16, 2007, we issued $400.0 million in
    principal of convertible senior notes that mature
    February 15, 2014. We pay 0.625% interest per annum on the
    principal amount of the notes, payable semi-annually in arrears
    in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The notes are
    convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of our common
    stock under certain circumstances as described in note “7.
    Convertible Senior Notes” in Part II, Item 8 of
    this

Form 10-K.

As of January 2, 2011, the principal amount of the notes
    was $390.0 million due to the conversion of
    $10.0 million of the notes during the first quarter of
    2009. During the period from January 3, 2011 to
    February 28, 2011, certain noteholders notified us of their
    election to convert an aggregate of $251.1 million
    principal amount of the notes. See note “15. Subsequent
    Events” in Part II, Item 8, of this

Form 10-K

for additional information on these conversions.

Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to
    change, include expenditures related to:

•

potential strategic acquisitions and investments;

•

support of our commercialization efforts related to our current
    and future products, including expansion of our direct sales
    force and field support resources both in the United States and
    abroad;

•

the repurchase of our outstanding common stock;

•

the continued advancement of research and development efforts;

•

the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in
    our current and future manufacturing and research and
    development facilities; and

•

the expansion needs of our facilities, including costs of
    leasing additional facilities.

We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating
    income, as well as the status of each of our new product
    development programs, will significantly impact our cash
    management decisions.

We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and
    income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating
    needs for at least the next 12 months, barring unforeseen
    circumstances. Operating needs



include the planned costs to operate our business, including
    amounts required to fund working capital and capital
    expenditures. At the present time, we have no material
    commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital
    requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend
    on many factors, including:

•

our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop
    our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;

•

scientific progress in our research and development programs and
    the magnitude of those programs;

•

competing technological and market developments; and

•

the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or
    acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement
    our product and service offerings.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
    finance or special purpose entities, which would have been
    established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
    arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
    During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, we were not
    involved in any “off-balance sheet arrangements”
    within the meaning of the rules of the SEC.

Contractual
    Obligations

Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and
    liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude
    orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course
    of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. The
    following table represents our contractual obligations as of
    January 2, 2011, aggregated by type (amounts in thousands):

Debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible
    senior notes and interest payments totaling 0.625% per annum.
    Although these notes mature in 2014, we classify the principal
    amount of the notes as current in our consolidated balance sheet
    due to the convertibility feature. In addition, during the
    period from January 3, 2011 to February 28, 2011,
    certain noteholders notified us of their election to convert an
    aggregate of $251.1 million principal amount of the notes
    in exchange for the repayment of the principal amount and a
    certain number of shares of the Company’s common stock. See
    note “7. Convertible Senior Notes” and note 15

for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior
    notes and the conversion notices in the subsequent period.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical
    experience, market and other conditions, and various other
    assumptions it believes to be reasonable. Although these
    estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
    current events and actions that may impact us in the future, the
    estimation process is, by its nature, uncertain given that
    estimates depend on events over which we may not have control.
    If market and other conditions change from those that we
    anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be
    materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we
    may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective
    actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies and
    estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and
    require our most significant judgments. In addition, had we used
    estimates different from any of these, our consolidated
    financial statements could have been materially different from
    those presented. Members of our senior management have discussed
    the development and selection of our critical accounting
    policies and estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with
    the audit committee of our board of directors. Our accounting
    policies are more fully described in note “1. Organization
    and Significant Accounting Policies” in Part II,
    Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and
    services. Product revenue primarily consists of sales of
    instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis. Service
    and other revenue primarily consists of revenue received for
    performing genotyping and sequencing services, extended warranty
    sales, and amounts earned under research agreements with
    government grants, which are recognized in the period during
    which the related costs are incurred. The timing of revenue
    recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in
    each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the
    specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our
    deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate
    amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and
    estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates.

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
    the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable,
    and collectibility is reasonably assured. In instances where
    final acceptance of the product or system is required, revenue
    is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met. All
    revenue is recorded net of any discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer
    of title to the customer, provided that no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured. Revenue for genotyping and sequencing
    services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the
    time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made
    available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable,
    we evaluate whether refund rights exist. If there are refund
    rights or payment terms based on future performance, we defer
    revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or
    determinable. We assess collectibility based on a number of
    factors, including past transaction history with the customer
    and the creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until receipt of payment.

We regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from
    multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services.
    These products or services are generally delivered within a
    short time frame, approximately three to six months, of the
    contract execution date. Revenue recognition for contracts with
    multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of
    accounting determined to exist in the contract. A delivered item
    is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered
    item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. Items are
    considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold
    separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the
    item on a stand-alone basis.



For transactions entered into in 2009 and 2010, consideration is
    allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables
    based on their relative selling price. The relative selling
    price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party
    evidence of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither
    VSOE nor third-party evidence exists, we use best estimate of
    the selling price for the deliverable.

For transactions entered into prior to 2009, consideration was
    generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its
    relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement. The
    fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the
    product, if the item was regularly sold on a stand-alone basis.
    In those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for the undelivered items but not for the
    delivered items, the residual method was used to allocate the
    arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount
    of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items
    equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
    fair value of the undelivered items. When we were unable to
    establish stand-alone value for delivered items or when fair
    value of undelivered items had not been established, revenue was
    deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been
    performed, or until fair value could objectively be determined
    for any remaining undelivered elements.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, we must regularly
    sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a
    substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range.
    VSOE of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range. If
    there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and VSOE
    of selling price cannot be determined, then we consider whether
    third party evidence can be used to establish selling price. Due
    to the lack of similar products and services sold by other
    companies within the industry, we have rarely established
    selling price using third-party evidence. If neither VSOE nor
    third party evidence of selling price exists, we determine our
    best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over
    a rolling

12-month

period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions.
    If the product or service has no history of sales or if the
    sales volume is not sufficient, we rely upon prices set by our
    pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts. We
    recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine
    there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

In the first quarter of 2010, we offered an incentive with the
    launch of the HiSeq 2000 that enabled existing Genome Analyzer
    customers to trade in their Genome Analyzer and receive a
    discount on the purchase of a HiSeq 2000. The incentive was
    limited to customers who had purchased a Genome Analyzer as of
    the date of the announcement and was the first significant
    trade-in program we have offered. We will account for HiSeq 2000
    discounts related to the Genome Analyzer trade-in program in the
    period in which the HiSeq 2000 revenue is recognized.

Investments

We determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based
    on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
    most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
    of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three
    levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
    observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices
    for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
    are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
    full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.



In using this fair value hierarchy, management may be required
    to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and
    assumptions about risk, specifically when using unobservable
    inputs to determine fair value. These assumptions are judgmental
    in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
    required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
    regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
    receivables are outstanding, review historical loss rates and
    assess current economic trends that may impact the level of
    credit losses in the future. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses.
    However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the
    financial stability of our customers and we may need to increase
    our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers
    deteriorate.

Inventory
    Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
    obsolete, or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
    realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
    market conditions, and the release of new products that will
    supersede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
    obsolete products and components, taking into account product
    life cycles, quality issues, historical experience, and usage
    forecasts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than
    anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
    intellectual property matters. We routinely assess the
    likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as
    well as ranges of probable losses, to the extent losses are
    reasonably estimable. If losses are probable and reasonably
    estimable, we will record a liability and an expense for the
    estimated loss. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is
    provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the
    exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial
    statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of
    litigation matters, management considers many factors. These
    factors include, but are not limited to, past history,
    scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of
    each matter. We may change our estimates if our assessment of
    the various factors changes, which may result in the recording
    of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual.
    Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating
    related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties
    that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates
    and accruals.

Business
    Combinations

Under the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair
    value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition.
    The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between willing market participants, are
    based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We
    record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of
    tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, as
    goodwill. These valuations require us to make significant
    estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible
    assets.

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, additional
    contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon
    completion of certain future performance milestones. Prior to
    fiscal year 2009, the Company recognized contingent
    consideration as an additional element of the cost of the
    acquisition, generally goodwill, when the contingency was
    resolved beyond a reasonable doubt and the additional
    consideration was issued or became issuable. Due to changes in
    the accounting standards regarding business combinations, for
    all acquisitions consummated on or after December 29, 2008,
    a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate
    of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent
    consideration by applying the income approach utilizing



variable factors such as anticipated future cash flows,
    risk-free adjusted discount rates and nonperformance risk. Any
    change in the fair value of the contingent consideration
    subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition
    related (gain) expense, net, a component of operating expenses,
    in the consolidated statements of income. This method requires
    significant management judgment, including the probability of
    achieving certain future milestones and discount rates. Future
    changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains.

Management uses a discounted cash flow method to value our
    acquired intangible assets. This method requires significant
    management judgment to forecast future operating results and
    establish residual growth rates and discount factors. The
    estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are
    consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage
    our business and are based on available historical information
    and industry estimates and averages. If the subsequent actual
    results and updated projections of the underlying business
    activity change compared with the assumptions and projections
    used to develop these values, we could experience impairment
    charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of
    certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate
    depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the
    economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses
    could be accelerated or slowed.

Intangible
    Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets — Impairment
    Assessments

We estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other
    long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an
    event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying
    value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted
    future operating cash flows.

In order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible
    assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful
    lives, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from
    those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted
    cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future
    cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period
    of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of
    achieving the cash flows, the time value of money, and other
    factors that a willing market participant would consider.
    Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and
    timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving
    those cash flows. We had a total of $129.9 million in net
    property and equipment and $70.0 million in net intangible
    assets on our balance sheet at January 2, 2011.

Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining
    useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be
    affected by a variety of factors, including external factors
    such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such
    as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
    For example, if our future operating results do not meet current
    forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market
    capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a
    reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units,
    we may be required to record future impairment charges for
    purchased intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially
    decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values
    on our balance sheet.

Share-Based
    Compensation

We are required to measure and recognize compensation expense
    for all share-based payments made to employees and directors
    based on estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of
    stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee
    stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
    option-pricing model. The fair value of our restricted stock
    units is based on the market price of our common stock on the
    date of grant.

The determination of fair value of share-based awards using the
    BSM model requires the use of certain estimates and highly
    judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share-based
    compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements
    of income. These include estimates of the expected volatility of
    our stock price, expected life of an award, expected dividends,
    and the risk-free interest rate. We determine the volatility of
    our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied
    volatility of our common stock. The historical volatility of our
    common stock over the most recent period is generally
    commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock
    awards, adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not
    reasonably



expected to recur, and other relevant factors. Implied
    volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of
    exchange-traded call options on our common stock. The expected
    life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience,
    exercise activity, and on the terms and conditions of the stock
    awards. We determined expected dividend yield to be 0% given we
    have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common
    stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash
    dividends. The risk-free interest rate is based upon
    U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to
    the expected term of the share-based awards. We amortize the
    fair value of share-based compensation on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service periods of the awards. If any of the
    assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly,
    share-based compensation expense may differ materially from what
    we have recorded in the current period.

Income
    Taxes

Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect
    our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.
    Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of
    existing tax laws or regulations in the U.S. and the
    numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income
    tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes.
    Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and estimates of the
    company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred
    tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated
    financial statements and would require an adjustment to the
    provision for income taxes.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the
    likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A
    valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more
    likely than not the future realization of all or some of a
    deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating our
    ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction
    which they arise we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book
    income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred
    tax liabilities, our history of earnings and reliable
    forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over the
    foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent
    tax planning strategies. Based on the available evidence as of
    January 2, 2011, we were not able to conclude it is more
    likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax
    assets will be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation
    allowance of $1.9 million and $3.1 million against
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.

We recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities regularly
    examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business
    and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s
    return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the
    uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments
    that are materially different from our current estimate of the
    tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and
    penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes
    in the period in which they are determined.

Warranties

We generally provide a one-year warranty on instruments.
    Additionally, we provide a warranty on consumables through the
    expiry date, which generally ranges from six to twelve months
    after the manufacture date. We establish an accrual for
    estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as
    well as anticipated product performance. We periodically review
    the adequacy of our warranty reserve, and adjust, if necessary,
    the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience
    and estimated costs to be incurred. If our estimates of warranty
    obligation change or if actual product performance is below our
    expectations we may incur additional warranty expense.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

Our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk for changes
    in interest rates. The fair market value of fixed rate
    securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest
    rates while income earned on floating rate securities may
    decline as a result of decreases in interest rates. Under our
    current policies, we do



not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure
    to interest rate changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and
    preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default
    risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default
    risk by investing in investment grade securities. We have
    historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for
    our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical
    100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the
    entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the
    fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments. In
    addition, if a 100 basis point change in overall interest
    rates were to occur in 2011, our interest income would change by
    approximately $8.9 million in relation to amounts we would
    expect to earn, based on our cash, cash equivalents, and
    short-term investments as of January 2, 2011.

Changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from
    the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes. As
    of January 2, 2011, we had $390.0 million aggregate
    principal amount of convertible notes outstanding. The notes are
    convertible into cash, and if applicable, shares of our common
    stock under certain circumstances, including trading price
    conditions related to our common stock. If the trading price of
    our common stock remains significantly above the conversion
    price of $21.83 per share, we expect that noteholders will elect
    to convert the notes. Upon conversion, we are required to record
    a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the
    debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying
    value. The fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on
    our current incremental borrowing rate. The net carrying value
    of the notes has an implicit interest rate of 8.27%. If our
    incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher
    or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes, we will
    record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income
    during the period in which the notes are converted. An
    incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis
    points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of
    $100 million aggregate principal amount of the notes would
    result in a loss of approximately $3.5 million.

Market
    Price Sensitive Instruments

In order to reduce potential equity dilution, in connection with
    the issuance (and potential conversion) of our convertible
    notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions,
    entitling us to purchase up to 18,322,320 shares of our
    common stock at a strike price of $21.83 per share, subject to
    adjustment. In addition, we sold to the hedge transaction
    counterparties warrants exercisable on a net-share basis, for up
    to 18,322,320 shares of our common stock at a strike price
    of $31.435 per share, subject to adjustment. The anti-dilutive
    effect of the note hedge transactions, if any, could be
    partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our
    common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the
    exercise dates of the warrants, which occur during 2014,
    assuming the warrants are exercised.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

We conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than
    the entity’s U.S. dollar functional currency. These
    transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that
    are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s
    functional currency. The value of these monetary assets and
    liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates
    from the time the transactions are originated until settlement
    in cash. Our foreign currency exposures are primarily
    concentrated in the Euro, Yen, British pound sterling,
    Australian dollar, and Singapore dollar. Both realized and
    unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets
    and liabilities are included in the determination of net income.
    We recorded a net currency exchange gain on business
    transactions, net of hedging transactions, of $1.0 million
    for each of the years ended January 2, 2011 and
    January 3, 2010, which are included in other (expense)
    income, net, in the consolidated statements of income.



We use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the
    foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with
    monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
    than the entity’s functional currency. We only use
    derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency
    exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We primarily
    use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency
    exposures, and they generally have terms of one month or less.
    Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of
    financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate
    exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also
    included in the determination of net income, as they have not
    been designated for hedge accounting. These contracts, which
    settle monthly, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these
    specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled, so
    that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses
    or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary
    assets and liabilities. At January 2, 2011, we had
    $20.0 million of foreign currency forward contracts
    outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Illumina, Inc. as of January 2, 2011 and January 3,
    2010, and the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended January 2, 2011. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Illumina, Inc. at January 2, 2011 and
    January 3, 2010, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended January 2, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, Illumina, Inc. changed its method of accounting for
    business combinations effective December 29, 2008.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 2, 2011, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
    and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the Company) is a leading developer,
    manufacturer, and marketer of life science tools and integrated
    systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. Using the Company’s proprietary technologies,
    Illumina provides a comprehensive line of genetic analysis
    solutions, with products and services that serve a broad range
    of highly interconnected markets, including sequencing,
    genotyping, gene expression, and molecular diagnostics. The
    Company’s customers include leading genomic research
    centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, and
    clinical research organizations, as well as pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, agrigenomics, and consumer genomics companies.

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
    Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
    14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
    June 30, September 30, and December 31. The year
    ended January 2, 2011 was 52 weeks; the year ended
    January 3, 2010 was 53 weeks; the year ended
    December 28, 2008 was 52 weeks.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Segment
    Information

The Company is organized in two business segments, the Life
    Sciences Business Unit and Diagnostics Business Unit. The Life
    Sciences Business Unit includes all products and services that
    are primarily related to the research market, namely the product
    lines based on the Company’s sequencing, BeadArray,
    VeraCode, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
    technologies, and the Diagnostics Business Unit focuses on the
    emerging opportunity in molecular diagnostics. During all
    periods presented, the Company had limited activity related to
    the Diagnostics Business Unit. Accordingly, the Company’s
    operating results for both units are reported on an aggregate
    basis as one reportable segment during these periods. The
    Company will begin reporting in two segments once revenues,
    operating profit or loss, or assets of the Diagnostics Business
    Unit exceed 10% of the consolidated amounts.

Acquisitions

Effective December 29, 2008, the Company adopted the
    FASB’s revised authoritative guidance for business
    combinations. This revised guidance requires an acquiring
    company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
    including contingent considerations and all contractual
    contingencies, at fair value as of the acquisition date. In
    addition, an acquiring company is required to capitalize
    in-process research and development (IPR&D) and either
    amortize it over the life of the product upon commercialization,
    or write it



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

off if the project is abandoned or impaired. Previously,
    post-acquisition adjustments related to business combination
    deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities for
    uncertain tax positions were generally required to be recorded
    as an increase or decrease to Goodwill. The revised guidance
    does not permit this accounting and, generally, requires any
    such changes to be recorded in current period income tax
    expense. Thus, all changes to valuation allowances and
    liabilities for uncertain tax positions established in
    acquisition accounting, regardless of the guidance used to
    initially account for the business combination, will be
    recognized in current period income tax expense. Additionally,
    this guidance requires that contingent purchase consideration be
    remeasured to estimated fair value at each reporting period with
    the change in fair value recorded in the results of operations.
    The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have an
    impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year
    ended January 3, 2010. As a result of acquisitions
    completed in the year ended January 2, 2011, the Company
    capitalized $21.4 million of IPR&D that would have
    been expensed under the previous guidance. In addition the
    Company recorded $14.1 million of contingent consideration
    liability at fair value at the acquisition date which was
    remeasured with a net consolidated statement of income impact of
    $10.4 million recorded in acquisition related (gain)
    expense, net, a component of operating expenses.

For an acquisition consummated prior to December 29, 2008,
    the Company recognizes additional contingent consideration as an
    additional element of the cost of the acquisition when the
    contingency is resolved beyond a reasonable doubt and the
    additional consideration is issued or becomes issuable, in
    accordance with the accounting guidance effective at the
    acquisition date. This results in additional IPR&D charges
    in periods subsequent to the acquisition recorded in acquisition
    related (gain) expense, net.

Cash
    Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly liquid
    investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date
    of purchase.

Short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury and
    U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and
    bonds, and commercial paper. Management classifies short-term
    investments as

available-for-sale

at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as
    of each balance sheet date. All short-term investments are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses
    for

available-for-sale

securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, a component of stockholders’ equity. The Company
    evaluates its investments to assess whether those with
    unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired.
    Impairments are considered to be other than temporary if they
    are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely
    that the Company will sell the securities before the recovery of
    their cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in
    value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on
    the specific identification method and are reported in other
    (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash and
    cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
    other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities,
    excluding acquisition related contingent consideration liability
    noted below, approximate the related fair values due to the
    short-term maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair
    value of the convertible senior notes is determined by using
    available market information as of the latest trading date prior
    to the Company’s fiscal year-end provided by a third party
    financial institution. The par value and approximate fair value
    of the Company’s convertible notes was $390.0 million
    and $1,142.5 million, respectively, at January 2,
    2011, and $390.0 million and $553.2 million,
    respectively, at January 3, 2010.

The Company determines the fair value of its assets and
    liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
    Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use
    of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with three
    levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
    observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 —

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 —

Inputs, other than Level 1,
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
    in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 —

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The following table presents the Company’s fair value
    hierarchy for assets and liability measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis as of January 2, 2011 and January 3,
    2010, respectively (in thousands):

    recurring basis primarily using quoted prices for similar assets
    in active markets.

Included in the total consideration transferred for the
    Company’s acquisition of Helixis, Inc. (Helixis), was
    contingent consideration payments that could range from $0 to
    $35 million based on the achievement of certain
    revenue-based milestones by December 31, 2010 and by
    December 31, 2011. On the acquisition date, a liability of
    $14.1 million was recorded at the estimated fair value of
    the contingent consideration. The December 31,
    2010 milestone was not achieved and the likelihood of
    paying the remaining contingent consideration of up to
    $30 million declined. Accordingly, the Company reassessed
    the fair value of the

contingent consideration at $3.7 million and recorded the
    change in fair value of $10.4 million in acquisition
    related (gain) expense, net, in the consolidated statements of
    income in the fourth quarter of 2010.

This fair value measurement is a Level 3 measurement as it
    is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or
    no market activity. Significant assumptions used in the
    measurement include probabilities of achieving the remaining
    milestone and the discount rates used in the income approach of
    valuation, which ranged from 27% to 52% depending on the
    likelihood assessed. Future changes in the fair value of the
    contingent consideration as a result of changes in these
    significant inputs could have a significant effect on the
    consolidated statements of income and the financial position in
    the period of the change.

The following table includes a summary of the changes in
    estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability

Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net invoice value
    and are not interest bearing. The Company considers receivables
    past due based on the contractual payment terms. The Company
    reviews its exposure to amounts receivable and reserves specific
    amounts if collectibility is no longer reasonably assured. The
    Company also reserves a percentage of its trade receivable
    balance based on collection history and current economic trends
    that might impact the level of future credit losses. The Company
    re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and adjusts its
    reserves as needed.

Concentrations
    of Risk

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and
    rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting
    customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or
    services with new capabilities, and other factors could
    negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

The Company is also subject to risks related to its financial
    instruments including its cash and cash equivalents,
    investments, and accounts receivable. Most of the Company’s
    cash and cash equivalents as of January 2, 2011 were
    deposited with financial institutions in the United States. The
    Company’s investment policy restricts the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer to 5% of the portfolio at the time of
    purchase and to any one industry sector, as defined by Bloomberg
    classifications, to 25% of the portfolio at the time of
    purchase. There is no limit to the percentage of the portfolio
    that may be maintained in U.S. treasury obligations,
    U.S. government agencies, and money market funds. The
    Company performs a regular review of customer activity and
    associated credit risks and do not require collateral or enter
    into netting arrangements. The Company has historically not
    experienced significant credit losses from investments and
    accounts receivable.

The Company’s products require customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
    Company obtains certain key components included in its products
    from single vendors.



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 45%,
    48%, and 51% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended
    January 2, 2011, January 3, 2010, and
    December 28, 2008, respectively. Customers outside the
    United States represented 59% and 46% of the Company’s
    gross trade accounts receivable balance as of January 2,
    2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively. Sales to
    territories outside of the United States are generally
    denominated in U.S. dollars. International sales entail a
    variety of risks, including currency exchange fluctuations,
    longer payment cycles, and greater difficulty in accounts
    receivable collection. The Company is also subject to general
    geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic
    instability, and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. The
    risks of international sales are mitigated in part by the extent
    to which sales are geographically distributed.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (on a first in, first
    out basis) or market. Inventory includes raw materials and
    finished goods that may be used in the research and development
    process and such items are expensed as consumed or expired.
    Provisions for slow moving, excess, and obsolete inventories are
    estimated based on product life cycles, quality issues,
    historical experience, and usage forecasts.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
    impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets (generally three to seven years) using the
    straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
    computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
    useful life of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are
    charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold, or
    otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
    depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
    is included in operating expense.

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net
    assets acquired. The change in the carrying value of goodwill
    during the year ended January 2, 2011 was due to goodwill
    recorded in connection with acquisitions consummated in the
    year. Intangible assets include acquired technology, customer
    relationships, other license agreements, and licensed technology
    (capitalized as part of the Affymetrix litigation). The cost of
    identified intangible assets is amortized on a straight-line
    basis over periods ranging from three to ten years.

The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if the
    carrying values of the long-lived assets are impaired. Goodwill
    and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives,
    such as IPR&D, are reviewed for impairment at least
    annually during the second fiscal quarter, or more frequently if
    an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The
    performance of the goodwill impairment test is a two-step
    process. The first step of the impairment test involves
    comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with
    its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount
    of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company
    performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
    determine the amount of loss, which involves comparing the
    implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying value of
    the goodwill. The Company performed its annual impairment test
    of goodwill in May of 2010, noting no impairment and has
    determined there have been no impairment indicators for goodwill
    through January 2, 2011. A review of intangible assets that
    have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets is
    performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for
    impairment. If indicators of impairment exist, the Company
    assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by
    determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds
    the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If impairment is
    indicated, the Company compares the carrying amount to the
    estimated fair value of the asset and adjusts the value of the
    asset accordingly. Factors that would necessitate an impairment
    assessment include a significant decline in the Company’s
    stock price

and market capitalization compared to its net book value,
    significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to
    generate positive cash flows, and significant changes in the
    Company’s strategic business objectives and utilization of
    the asset.

Reserve
    for Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    instruments. Additionally, the Company provides a warranty on
    its consumables through the expiry date, which generally ranges
    from six to twelve months after the manufacture date. The
    Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses
    based on historical experience as well as anticipated product
    performance. The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of
    its warranty reserve, and adjusts, if necessary, the warranty
    percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated
    costs to be incurred. Warranty expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of product revenue. Warranty expenses
    associated with extended maintenance contracts for systems are
    recorded as cost of service and other revenue as incurred. See
    note “6. Warranties” for further detailed discussion.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale
    of products and services. Product revenue primarily consists of
    sales of instrumentation and consumables used in genetic
    analysis. Service and other revenue primarily consists of
    revenue received for performing genotyping and sequencing
    services, extended warranty sales, and amounts earned under
    research agreements with government grants, which are recognized
    in the period during which the related costs are incurred.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In
    instances where final acceptance of the product or system is
    required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria
    have been met. All revenue is recorded net of any discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer
    of title to the customer, provided that no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured. Revenue for genotyping and sequencing
    services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the
    time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made
    available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable,
    the Company evaluates whether refund rights exist. If there are
    refund rights or payment terms based on future performance, the
    Company defers revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed
    or determinable. The Company assesses collectibility based on a
    number of factors, including past transaction history with the
    customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If the
    Company determines that collection of a payment is not
    reasonably assured, revenue recognition is deferred until
    receipt of payment.

The Company regularly enters into contracts where revenue is
    derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products
    or services. These products or services are generally delivered
    within a short time frame, approximately three to six months, of
    the contract execution date. Revenue recognition for contracts
    with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of
    accounting determined to exist in the contract. A delivered item
    is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered
    item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. Items are
    considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold
    separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the
    item on a stand-alone basis.

For transactions entered into in 2009 and 2010, consideration is
    allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables
    based on their relative selling price. The relative selling
    price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party
    evidence of selling



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor third-party
    evidence exists, the Company uses its best estimate of the
    selling price for the deliverable.

For transactions entered into prior to 2009, consideration was
    generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its
    relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement. The
    fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the
    product, if the item was regularly sold on a stand-alone basis.
    In those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for the undelivered items but not for the
    delivered items, the residual method was used to allocate the
    arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount
    of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items
    equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
    fair value of the undelivered items. When the Company was unable
    to establish stand-alone value for delivered items or when fair
    value of undelivered items had not been established, revenue was
    deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been
    performed, or until fair value could objectively be determined
    for any remaining undelivered elements.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, the Company must
    regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with
    a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range.
    VSOE of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range. If
    there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and VSOE
    of selling price cannot be determined, then the Company
    considers whether third party evidence can be used to establish
    selling price. Due to the lack of similar products and services
    sold by other companies within the industry, the Company has
    rarely established selling price using third-party evidence. If
    neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists,
    the Company determines its best estimate of selling price using
    average selling prices over a rolling

12-month

period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions.
    If the product or service has no history of sales or if the
    sales volume is not sufficient, the Company relies upon prices
    set by the Company’s pricing committee adjusted for
    applicable discounts. The Company recognizes revenue for
    delivered elements only when it determines there are no
    uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

In the first quarter of 2010, the Company offered an incentive
    with the launch of the HiSeq 2000 that enabled existing Genome
    Analyzer customers to trade in their Genome Analyzer and receive
    a discount on the purchase of a HiSeq 2000. The incentive was
    limited to customers who had purchased a Genome Analyzer as of
    the date of the announcement and was the first significant
    trade-in program offered by the Company. The Company accounts
    for HiSeq 2000 discounts related to the Genome Analyzer trade-in
    program in the period in which the HiSeq 2000 revenue is
    recognized.

Shipping
    and Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
    revenue.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
    internal and grant-sponsored research and development. Research
    and development expenses include personnel expenses, contractor
    fees, facilities costs, and utilities. Expenditures relating to
    research and development are expensed in the period incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    costs were $6.9 million, $4.2 million, and
    $3.4 million for the years ended January 2, 2011,
    January 3, 2010, and December 28, 2008, respectively.

Leases

Leases are reviewed and classified as capital or operating at
    their inception. For leases that contain rent escalations, the
    Company records the total rent payable on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the lease, which includes the construction
    build-out period but excludes lease extension periods. The
    difference between rent payments and straight-line rent expense
    is recorded in other long-term liabilities. Landlord allowances
    are also recorded in other long-term liabilities, which are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a
    reduction to rent expense.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. The
    effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in
    the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the
    likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A
    valuation allowance is established when the Company believes it
    is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of
    a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating the
    ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction
    which they arise the Company considers all available positive
    and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative
    pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled
    reversals of deferred tax liabilities, history of earnings and
    reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over
    the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and
    prudent tax planning strategies.

The Company recognizes excess tax benefits associated with
    share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when
    realized. When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company.

The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the
    financial statements only if that position is more likely than
    not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities,
    based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and
    penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected
    in income tax expense.

Functional
    Currency

Prior to the third quarter of 2008, the Company identified the
    local currency as the functional currency in each of its foreign
    subsidiaries, with all translation adjustments recorded as part
    of other comprehensive income. Beginning in the third quarter of
    2008, the Company reorganized its international structure to
    execute a more efficient relationship among product development,
    product manufacturing, and sales. This reorganization increased
    the foreign subsidiaries’ dependence on the
    U.S. entity for management decisions, financial support,
    production assets, and inventory, thereby making the foreign
    subsidiaries a direct and integral component of the
    U.S. entity’s operations. As a result, the Company
    reassessed the primary economic environment of its foreign
    subsidiaries, resulting in a U.S. dollar functional
    currency determination. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008,
    the Company remeasures its foreign subsidiaries’ assets and
    liabilities and revenue and expense accounts related to monetary
    assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the
    net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other
    (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of

income. Gains or (losses) resulting from remeasurement were
    $0.6 million, $(2.3) million, and $3.8 million
    for the years ended January 2, 2011, January 3, 2010
    and December 28, 2008, respectively.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risks in the
    normal course of business. To manage a portion of the accounting
    exposure resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to
    hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These foreign
    exchange contracts are carried at fair value and do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment and are not designated as hedging
    instruments. Changes in the value of the derivative are
    recognized in other (expense) income, net, in the consolidated
    statements of income for the current period, along with an
    offsetting gain or loss on the underlying assets or liabilities.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock
    purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). This
    model incorporates various assumptions including expected
    volatility, expected life of an award, expected dividends, and
    the risk-free interest rates. The Company determines volatility
    by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of the
    Company’s common stock. The historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock over the most recent period is
    generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
    Company’s stock awards, adjusted for the impact of unusual
    fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant
    factors. The implied volatility is calculated from the implied
    market volatility of exchange-traded call options on the
    Company’s common stock. The expected life of an award is
    based on historical forfeiture experience, exercise activity,
    and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards. The fair
    value of restricted stock units granted is based on the market
    price of our common stock on the date of grant. The Company
    amortizes the fair value of share-based compensation on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
    awards.

The assumptions used for the specified reporting periods and the
    resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
    options granted and for stock purchases under the ESPP during
    those periods are as follows:

Net
    Income per Share

On July 22, 2008, the Company announced a

two-for-one

stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend with a record
    date of September 10, 2008 and a distribution date of
    September 22, 2008. Share and per share amounts have been
    restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented.

Basic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing net
    income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per
    share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period
    increased to include dilutive potential common shares using the
    treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares consist
    of stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized
    compensation expense that are less than the average market price
    of the Company’s common stock, restricted stock units with
    unrecognized compensation expense, convertible debt when the
    average market price of the Company’s common stock is above
    the conversion price of $21.83 and warrants with exercise prices
    that are less than the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Under the treasury stock method,
    the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and
    warrants, the average amount of compensation expense for future
    services that the Company has not yet recognized for stock
    options and restricted stock units, and the amount of estimated
    tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital
    when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to
    repurchase shares. In loss periods, basic net loss per share and
    diluted net loss per share are identical since the effect of
    dilutive potential common shares is anti-dilutive and therefore
    excluded.

    granting the Company an option to sell all of its auction rate
    securities at par value to UBS during the period of
    June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. To account for the
    option, the Company recorded a separate freestanding asset (put
    option). On July 1, 2010, the Company exercised its option
    to sell all of its remaining auction rate securities at par.
    From January 3, 2010 through July 1, 2010 the increase
    in the fair value of the auction rate securities was equal to
    the decrease in the fair value of the put option. As such, no

Acquisitions

On April 30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Helixis, a company developing a high-performance, low-cost, real
    time PCR system used for nucleic acid analysis. Total
    consideration for the acquisition at the closing date was
    approximately $86.7 million, including $70.0 million
    in cash (net of $2.6 million of cash acquired) and
    $14.1 million for the fair value of contingent
    consideration payments that could range from $0 to
    $35 million based on the achievement of certain
    revenue-based milestones by December 31, 2011. Using
    information available at the close of the acquisition, the
    Company allocated approximately $2.3 million of the
    consideration to tangible assets, net of liabilities, and
    approximately $28.0 million to identified intangible assets
    that will be amortized over a useful life of 10 years. The
    Company also recorded a $10.7 million deferred tax
    liability to reflect the tax impact of the identified intangible
    assets that will not generate tax deductible amortization
    expense and an $8.7 million deferred tax asset which
    primarily relates to acquired net operating loss carryforwards.
    The Company recorded the excess consideration of approximately
    $58.4 million as goodwill, which is not deductible for
    income tax purposes.

Prior to the acquisition, the Company had an equity interest in
    Helixis with a cost basis of $2.0 million that was
    accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The Company
    recognized a gain of $2.9 million, which was included in
    other (expense) income, net, in its consolidated statement of
    income as a result of revaluing the Company’s equity
    interest in Helixis on the acquisition date.

On July 28, 2010, the Company completed an acquisition of
    another privately-held, development stage entity. Total
    consideration for the acquisition was $22.0 million. As a
    result of this transaction, the company recorded an in-process
    research and development (IPR&D) asset of
    $21.4 million in other assets (long-term). In determining
    the fair value of the IPR&D, various factors were
    considered, such as future revenue contributions, additional
    research and development costs to be incurred, and contributory
    asset charges. The fair value of the IPR&D was calculated
    using an income approach, and the rate used to discount net
    future cash flows to their present values was based on a
    risk-adjusted rate of return of approximately 28%. Significant
    factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return
    include the weighted average cost of capital, the weighted
    average return on assets, the internal rate of return, as well
    as the risks inherent in the development process for
    development-stage entities of similar sizes.

IPR&D will not be amortized until the development efforts
    are complete and until then, the Company will perform an annual
    impairment test of the asset, or more frequently if events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be
    impaired. The impairment test will involve a comparison of the
    fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. If its
    carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall
    be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Upon completion
    of the related development efforts, the Company will start
    amortizing the IPR&D based on an estimated useful life.
    Through January 2, 2011, there was no indication of
    impairment of IPR&D and no impairment loss has been
    recorded.

In 2008, the Company completed an acquisition of another
    development-stage company. At the time of the acquisition, the
    Company paid $25.8 million in cash, including transaction
    costs. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance
    effective at that time, the Company recorded a charge of
    $24.7 million for purchased in-process research and
    development (IPR&D). As part of the acquisition agreement,
    Illumina agreed to pay the former shareholders of the entity up
    to an additional $35.0 million in contingent cash
    consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones. As
    contingent consideration payments are made,

Intangible
    Assets

The Company’s intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are
    comprised primarily of licensed technology from the Affymetrix
    settlement entered into on January 9, 2008, acquired core
    technology and customer relationships from the acquisition of
    Solexa, and acquired core technology from the acquisition of
    Helixis. As a result of the Affymetrix settlement, the Company
    agreed, without admitting liability, to make a one-time payment
    to Affymetrix, of which $36.0 million was recorded as
    licensed technology and classified as an intangible asset. The
    effective life of the licensed technology extends through 2015,
    the final expiry date of all patents considered in valuing the
    intangible asset. Amortization related to the Affymetrix
    licensed technology is recorded on a straight-line basis.

In connection with the acquisition of Helixis. in April 2010,
    the Company recorded an additional core technology of
    $28.0 million with a useful life of approximately
    10 years. Acquired core technologies and customer
    relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives.

Impairment

Investments

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company determined that a
    $6.0 million cost-method investment and a related
    $6.8 million note receivable with interest receivable of
    $0.4 million were below carrying value and the impairment
    was

other-than-temporary.

This determination was based upon continued shortfalls from
    revenue plans coupled with events in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2010 that created uncertainty regarding the entity’s
    ability to obtain additional funding in a required timeframe for
    the entity to continue operations. As a result, the Company
    recorded an impairment charge of $13.2 million in other
    (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income
    for the year ended January 2, 2011.

Manufacturing
    Equipment

During the year ended December 28, 2008, the Company
    implemented next-generation imaging and decoding systems to be
    used in manufacturing. These systems were developed to increase
    existing capacity and allow the Company to transition to the
    Infinium High-Density (HD) product line. As a result of this
    transition, the demand for products manufactured on the previous
    infrastructure was reduced and certain systems were no longer
    being utilized. A non-cash impairment charge of
    $4.1 million was recorded in the year ended
    December 28, 2008 for the excess machinery. This charge is
    included as a separate line item in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of income. There was no change to useful
    lives and related depreciation expenses of the remaining assets
    as the Company believes these estimates are currently reflective
    of the period the assets will be used in operations.

6.

Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    instruments. Additionally, the Company provides a warranty on
    its consumables through the expiry date, which generally ranges
    from six to twelve months after the manufacture date. At the
    time revenue is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual
    for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience
    as well as anticipated product performance. The Company
    periodically reviews the adequacy of our warranty reserve, and
    adjusts, if necessary, the warranty percentage and accrual based
    on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred.
    Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of product
    revenue. Estimated warranty expenses associated with extended
    maintenance contracts for systems are recorded as a cost of
    service and other revenue as incurred.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued
    $400.0 million principal amount of 0.625% convertible
    senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds from the offering, after
    deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering
    expenses, were approximately $390.3 million. The Company
    pays 0.625% interest per annum on the principal amount of the
    notes, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15
    and August 15 of each year. The notes mature on
    February 15, 2014.

The notes are convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares
    of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value per
    share, based on a conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of
    45.8058 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which
    represents a conversion price of approximately $21.83 per
    share), only in the following circumstances and to the following
    extent: (1) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per
    note for each day of such measurement period was less than 97%
    of the product of the last reported sale price of the
    Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such
    day; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported
    sale price of the Company’s common stock for 20 or more
    trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending
    on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
    quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in
    effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    calendar quarter; (3) upon the occurrence of specified
    events; and (4) at any time on or after November 15,
    2013 through the third scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date. The requirements of the second
    condition above were satisfied during each of the calendar
    quarters of 2010 and the first, second and third quarters of
    2009. Accordingly, the notes were and continue to be convertible
    during the period from, and including, April 1, 2009
    through, and including, December 31, 2009 and again during
    the period April 1, 2010 through, and including,
    March 31, 2011. Additionally, these same requirements were
    satisfied during the third quarter of 2008, and, as a result,
    the notes were convertible during the period from, and
    including, October 1, 2008 through, and including,
    December 31, 2008. On December 29, 2008, a noteholder
    converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of
    $10.0 million. On February 4, 2009, the settlement
    date, we paid the noteholder the conversion value of the notes
    in cash, up to the principal amount of the notes. The excess of
    the conversion value over the principal amount, totaling
    $2.9 million, was paid in shares of common stock. This
    equity dilution upon conversion of the notes was offset by the
    reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge
    transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the
    notes.

The hedge transaction entered with the initial purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the hedge counterparties) entitles the Company to
    purchase up to 18,322,320 shares of the Company’s
    common stock at a strike price of approximately $21.83 per
    share, subject to adjustment. In addition, the Company sold to
    these hedge

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

counterparties warrants exercisable, on a cashless basis, for up
    to 18,322,320 shares of the Company’s common stock at
    a strike price of $31.435 per share, subject to adjustment. The
    cost of the hedge transaction that was not covered by the
    proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately
    $46.6 million and was reflected as a reduction of
    additional paid-in capital. The hedge transaction is expected to
    reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the
    notes to the extent the Company exercises the hedge to purchase
    shares from the hedge counterparties to deliver to converting
    noteholders. However, the warrants could have a dilutive effect
    on the Company’s earnings per share to the extent that the
    price of the Company’s common stock exceeds the strike
    price of the warrants.

As of January 2, 2011, the principal amount of the
    convertible senior notes was $390.0 million due to
    conversion of $10.0 million of the notes during the first
    quarter of 2009. The unamortized discount was $78.4 million
    resulting in a net carrying amount of the liability component of
    $311.6 million. As of January 3, 2010, the principal
    amount of the notes was $390.0 million and the unamortized
    discount was $99.8 million, resulting in a net carrying
    amount of the liability of $290.2 million. Upon the
    conversion, the Company recorded a gain of $0.8 million in
    the first quarter of 2009, calculated as the difference between
    the carrying amount of the converted notes and their estimated
    fair value as of the settlement date. To measure the fair value
    of the converted notes as of the settlement date, the Company
    calculated an interest rate of 11.3% using Level 2
    Observable Inputs. This rate was applied to the converted notes
    and coupon interest rate using the same present value technique
    used in the issuance date valuation. The remaining period over
    which the discount on the liability component will be amortized
    is 3.12 years.

Commitments

Operating
    Leases

The Company leases office and manufacturing facilities under
    various noncancellable operating lease agreements. Facility
    leases generally provide for periodic rent increases, and many
    contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Certain leases
    require the Company to pay property taxes and routine
    maintenance. The Company is headquartered in San Diego,
    California and leases facilities in San Diego, California;
    Hayward, California; Carlsbad, California; Branford,
    Connecticut; the United Kingdom; the Netherlands; Japan;
    Singapore; Australia; and China.

    January 3, 2010, and December 28, 2008, respectively.

On December 30, 2010, the Company entered into a lease
    agreement for a new corporate headquarters facility located in
    San Diego, California. The lease has a target commencement
    date of November 1, 2011 and has an initial term of
    20 years with four five-year options to extend. There is a
    one-time option to terminate the lease after 15 years in
    exchange for an early termination fee. The lease includes two

buildings and a central plant building with approximately
    346,600 square feet. The Company has also agreed to lease a
    third office building to be built at this facility containing
    approximately 123,400 rentable square feet. The Company has
    the right to further expand the premises and lease one or more
    of three additional office buildings that may be built at this
    facility. Included in the table above are future minimum lease
    payments during the initial term of the lease, which are
    expected to total approximately $355.9 million, excluding
    further expansion beyond the third building, and taking no
    consideration of tenant improvement allowances of approximately
    $21.9 million. The Company will capitalize the leasehold
    improvements and amortize them over the shorter of the lease
    term or their expected useful life. The leasehold improvement
    allowances will reduce rent expense over the initial lease term.

Lease commitments of $108.3 million related to the lease
    for the Company’s current headquarters are also included in
    the table above. The Company plans to cease the use of the
    facility near the end of 2011 and the Company is further
    obligated for certain ongoing operating costs prior to any
    sublease that may be obtained. Upon cease-use of the facility,
    the Company will record an estimated loss for the present value
    of the expected shortfall between the remaining lease payments
    obligation and estimated sublease rental during the remaining
    lease period, adjusted for deferred rents and leasehold
    improvements.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
    adopted the 2000 ESPP. A total of 15,467,426 shares of the
    Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
    under the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase
    common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions,
    during defined offering periods.

The price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to
    85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or
    last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The initial
    offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition, beginning
    with fiscal 2001, the ESPP provides for annual increases of
    shares available for issuance by the lesser of 3% of the number
    of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the
    last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year,
    3,000,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined by the

    transactions or through privately negotiated transactions in
    compliance with

Rule 10b-18

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This program expired
    at the end of 2009.

In July 2010, the Company’s board of directors authorized a
    $200 million stock repurchase program, with
    $100 million allocated to repurchasing Company common stock
    under a 10b5-1 plan over a 12 month period and
    $100 million allocated to repurchasing Company common stock
    at management’s discretion during open trading windows. In
    fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 0.8 million shares for
    $44.0 million under the program authorized in July 2010.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the board of directors of the Company
    declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the
    Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 to the
    stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the
    registered holder to purchase from the Company one unit
    consisting of one-thousandth of a share of its Series A
    Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $100 per
    unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a person or group
    hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
    outstanding common stock of the Company or announces an offer
    for 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. If a person or
    group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common stock of
    the Company, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at
    the exercise price of the Right, a number of shares of common
    stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of
    the Right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or other
    business combination transaction after a person acquires 15% or
    more of the Company’s common stock, each Right will entitle
    its holder to purchase, at the Right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of common shares of the acquiring
    company which at the time of such transaction have a market
    value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The board of
    directors will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.01 per Right at any time before any such person acquires
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock. The Rights expire on May 14, 2011 unless such date
    is extended or the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
    the Company.

Legal
    Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is party to litigation and other
    legal proceedings in the ordinary course, and incidental to the
    conduct, of its business. While the results of any litigation or
    other legal proceedings are uncertain, the Company does not
    believe the ultimate resolution of any pending legal matters is
    likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial
    position or results of operations.

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis, and includes a review of all available positive and
    negative evidence. During 2010, the valuation allowance
    decreased by $9.9 million primarily due to increased
    profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries related to the
    corporate restructuring implemented during the fourth quarter.
    Based on the available evidence as of January 2, 2011, the
    Company was not able to conclude it is more likely than not
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be
    realized. Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance
    of $1.9 million and $3.1 million against certain
    U.S. and foreign net deferred tax assets, respectively.

As of January 2, 2011, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    $37.5 million and $161.7 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2020 and 2017, respectively, unless utilized
    prior. In addition, the Company also had U.S. federal and
    state research and development tax credit carryforwards of
    $13.7 million and $28.7 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2027 and 2019, respectively, unless utilized
    prior.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and
    credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any
    significant future changes in its ownership structure. These
    annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating
    losses and credits prior to utilization. The deferred tax assets
    as of January 2, 2011 are net of any previous limitations
    due to Section 382 and 383.

The Company recognizes excess tax benefits associated with
    share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when
    realized. When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

have been realized, the Company follows the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company. During 2010, the Company realized $42.4 million of
    such excess tax benefits, and accordingly recorded a
    corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. As of
    January 2, 2011, the Company has $16.7 million of
    unrealized excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation. These tax benefits will be accounted for as a
    credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized,
    rather than a reduction of the provision for income taxes.

The Company’s manufacturing operations in Singapore operate
    under various tax holidays and incentives that begin to expire
    in 2018. For the year ended January 2, 2011, these tax
    holidays and incentives resulted in an approximate
    $2.3 million decrease to the provision for income taxes and
    an increase to net income per diluted share of $0.02.

Residual U.S. income taxes have not been provided on
    $66.0 million of undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 2, 2011, since the earnings are
    considered to be indefinitely invested in the operations of such
    subsidiaries.

The following table summarizes the gross amount of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions (in thousands):

As of January 2, 2011, $18.3 million of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions would reduce the
    Company’s annual effective tax rate, if recognized.

The Company does not expect its uncertain tax positions to
    change significantly over the next 12 months. Any interest
    and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be
    reflected in income tax expense. As of January 2, 2011,
    minimal interest was accrued related to the Company’s
    uncertain tax positions. Tax years 1995 to 2010 remain subject
    to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which
    the Company is subject to tax.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Retirement
    Plan

The Company has a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all
    of its employees. Company contributions to the plan are
    discretionary. During the years ended January 2, 2011,
    January 3, 2010, and December 28, 2008, the Company
    made matching contributions of $4.2 million,
    $3.3 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan

The Company adopted the Illumina, Inc. Deferred Compensation
    Plan (the Plan) that became effective January 1, 2008.
    Eligible participants, which include the Company’s senior
    level employees and members of the board of directors, can
    contribute up to 80% of their base salary and 100% of all other
    forms of compensation into the Plan, including bonus, equity
    awards, commission and director fees. The Company has agreed to
    credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that
    reflect the performance of certain



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

independent investment funds. On a discretionary basis, the
    Company may also make employer contributions to participant
    accounts in any amount determined by the Company. The vesting
    schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion
    of the Compensation Committee. However, all employer
    contributions shall become 100% vested upon the occurrence of
    the participant’s disability, death or retirement or a
    change in control of the Company. The benefits under this plan
    are unsecured. Participants are generally eligible to receive
    payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected
    deferral period or after termination of their employment with
    the Company for any reason or at a later date to comply with the
    restrictions of Section 409A. As of January 2, 2011,
    no employer contributions were made to the Plan.

In January 2008, the Company also established a rabbi trust for
    the benefit of the participants under the Plan. In accordance
    with authoritative guidance related to consolidation of variable
    interest entities and accounting for deferred compensation
    arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and
    invested, the Company has included the assets of the rabbi trust
    in its consolidated balance sheet since the trust’s
    inception. As of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010,
    the assets of the trust were $6.1 million and $4.0 million,
    respectively, and liabilities of the Company were
    $5.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The
    assets and liabilities are classified as other assets and
    accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the values of the assets
    held by the rabbi trust are recorded in other (expense) income,
    net in the consolidated statement of income.

13.

Segment
    Information, Geographic Data, and Significant
    Customers

The Company is organized in two business segments, the Life
    Sciences Business Unit and Diagnostics Business Unit. The Life
    Sciences Business Unit includes all products and services that
    are primarily related to the research market, namely the product
    lines based on the Company’s sequencing, BeadArray,
    VeraCode, and real-time PCR technologies. The Diagnostics
    Business Unit focuses on the emerging opportunity in molecular
    diagnostics. During all periods presented, the Company had
    limited activity related to the Diagnostics Business Unit.
    Accordingly, the Company’s operating results for both units
    were reported on an aggregate basis as one reportable segment
    during these periods. The Company will begin reporting in two
    segments once revenues, operating profit or loss, or assets of
    the Diagnostics Business Unit exceed 10% of the consolidated
    amounts.

The Company had revenue in the following regions for the years

Subsequent
    Events

On January 10, 2011, the Company acquired Epicentre
    Biotechnologies, Inc., a provider of nucleic acid sample
    preparation reagents and specialty enzymes used in sequencing
    and microarray applications. Total consideration exchanged for
    the acquisition includes $60 million in cash,
    $15 million in stock that is subject to forfeiture if
    certain non-revenue based milestones are not met, and up to
    $15 million in contingent consideration payments based on
    the achievement of certain revenue-based milestones by
    January 10, 2013. Due to the limited time since the
    acquisition date, the Company has not completed the initial
    purchase accounting for this acquisition, including the
    assessment of fair values of consideration exchanged, assets
    acquired, and liabilities assumed.



ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the period from January 3, 2011 to February 28,
    2011, certain noteholders notified the Company of their election
    to convert an aggregate of $251.1 million principal amount
    of our convertible senior notes in exchange for the repayment of
    the principal amount and a certain number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock representing the “in the
    money” amount of the notes. The number of shares of common
    stock to be delivered upon conversion is based on the
    Company’s volume weighted average price over a

twenty-day

observation period that begins following the date of the
    election to convert. In connection with the conversions, the
    Company expects to exercise its right under the convertible note
    hedge with its hedging counterparties to repurchase the same
    amount of shares as exchanged in the conversions. The majority
    of the notified conversions have not been executed as the

twenty-day

observation period has not concluded as of February 28,
    2011.

Upon conversion, the Company will record a gain or loss for the
    difference between the fair value of the notes to be
    extinguished and its corresponding carrying value, net of
    unamortized debt issuance costs. The fair value of the notes to
    be extinguished depends on the Company’s current
    incremental borrowing rate. The net carrying value of the notes
    has an implicit interest rate of 8.27%. As the interest rate
    applicable at the time of conversion is likely to be lower than
    the implied interest rate of the notes, the Company will likely
    record a loss in its consolidated statement of income during the
    first quarter of 2011.

Controls
    and Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
    (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
    improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
    recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal
    controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable
    laws and our established financial policies.

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of January 2, 2011. Based upon
    that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that, as of January 2, 2011,
    our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
    that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in
    the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
    Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and
    (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
    functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
    controls and procedures, our management recognized that any
    controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
    desired control objectives, and our management have concluded
    that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
    company have been detected.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with
    the participation of our management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in
    our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2010 and that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation did
    not identify any such change.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of January 2, 2011. The
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 2, 2011 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as stated
    in their report which is included herein.

    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of January 2, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of
    January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    January 2, 2011 of Illumina, Inc. and our report dated
    February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
