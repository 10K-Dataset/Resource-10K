Overview

We are a leading developer of next-generation
tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Understanding genetic variation and function is
critical to the development of personalized medicine, a key goal
of genomics. Our tools will provide information that could be
used to improve drugs and therapies, customize diagnoses and
treatment, and cure disease.

Completion of the sequencing of the human genome
will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in
processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw
genetic data into medically valuable information. This requires
functional analysis of highly complex biological systems,
involving a scale of experimentation not practical using
currently available tools and technologies. Using our
technologies, we are developing a comprehensive line of products
that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of
functional analysis required to achieve the goals of molecular
medicine.

Our patented BeadArray technology uses fiber
optics to achieve a level of array miniaturization that allows
for a new scale of experimentation. An array is a collection of
miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many
tests, or assays, to be performed in parallel. By arranging our
arrays in a pattern that matches the wells of industry standard
containers called microtiter plates, we can simultaneously
process many samples in parallel, achieving throughput
significantly beyond the capability of any technology known to
us. We assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive raw
materials. Our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to
easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications. These
advances allow us to create next-generation arrays with a unique
combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness and
flexibility. In addition, our complementary Oligator technology
permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces
of DNA necessary to perform large-scale genetic analysis on
arrays.

We intend to provide both products and services
that utilize our proprietary technologies. During 2001, we
launched our commercial SNP genotyping services business which
combines our BeadArray technology with an automated, laboratory
information managements system controlled process to provide
high throughput identification of the most common form of
genetic variation, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or
SNPs. We also manufacture custom oligonucleotides for sale using
our proprietary Oligator technology. Our first genotyping
products, being developed in partnership with Applied
Biosystems, will include disposable BeadArray cassettes that we
manufacture plus reagent kits for analyzing variation in genetic
sequences and



instruments that automatically read data from the
BeadArray cassettes, both of which will be manufactured by
Applied Biosystems. An array cassette is a collection of
individual arrays arranged in a pattern, and a reagent kit is a
set of chemicals used for performing specific analyses. We also
plan to commercialize a confocal laser scanning instrument that
will be used to read our array cassettes.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998.
We reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal
executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San
Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is
(858) 202-4500.

Industry Background

Genetic Variation and
	Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene,
one from each parent. The two copies of each gene may be
identical, or they may be different. These differences are
referred to as genetic variation. Examples of the physical
consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and
hair color. Genetic variation can also have important medical
consequences, including predisposition to disease and
differential response to drugs. Genetic variation affects
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
cause people to respond differently to the same drug. Some
people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
still others may experience adverse side effects. The most
common form of genetic variation is a Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism, or SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position
in a DNA sequence. It is estimated that the human genome
contains between three and six million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be
responsible for medically important effects, it is now believed
that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result
of the interaction of many SNPs. Therefore, it will be important
to investigate many SNPs together in order to discover medically
valuable information.

Current efforts to understand genetic variation
and function have centered around three principal techniques:
SNP genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics.

SNP Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining
which SNPs are present in each of the two copies of a gene, or
other portion of DNA sequence, within an individual or other
organism. The use of SNP genotyping to obtain meaningful
statistics on the effect of an individual SNP or a collection of
SNPs, and to apply that information to clinical trials and
diagnostic testing, will require the analysis of millions of SNP
genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease.
For example, a single large clinical trial could involve
genotyping 300,000 SNPs per patient in 1,000 patients, thus
requiring 300 million assays. Using available technologies, this
scale of SNP genotyping is both impractical and prohibitively
expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping, when commercially
feasible, will be used for a variety of applications, including
genomics-based drug development, clinical trial analysis,
disease predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP
genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare, for example
in the development of plants and animals with desirable
commercial characteristics. These markets will require billions
of SNP genotyping assays annually.

Gene Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of
determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group
of cells and is accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary
between genes and proteins. Variation in gene expression can
cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease or
predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression patterns
between cells from different environments, such as normal tissue
compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a
drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in
these processes can be identified. Studies of this type, used in
drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and preferably
tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of samples. The
high cost of large-scale gene expression profiling has limited
the development of the gene expression profiling market.



Once gene expression patterns have been
correlated to specific diseases, gene expression profiling is
expected to become an important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use
of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly
with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and
the availability of more cost-effective technologies.

Proteomics

Proteomics is the process of determining which
proteins are present in cells and how they interact with one
another. Proteomics is another method of correlating the
molecular state of a cell with disease or reaction to a stimulus
such as a drug. This market remains undeveloped, as low cost,
accurate technologies for analysis have not been available. We
expect that proteomics will become valuable in drug discovery
research as the technologies improve and that array technology
will be critical in facilitating the growth of this market.

Our Technologies

We have developed a proprietary array technology
that enables the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Our BeadArray technology combines fiber optic bundles
and microscopic beads in a simple proprietary manufacturing
process to produce array cassettes that can perform many assays
simultaneously. Our BeadArray technology provides a unique
combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness, and
flexibility. We achieve high throughput with a high density of
test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in a
pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter
plates. We maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption
of expensive reagents and valuable samples, and from the low
manufacturing costs associated with our complementary
technologies. Our ability to vary the size, shape and format of
the fiber optic bundles and to create specific beads for
different applications provides the flexibility to address
multiple markets and market segments. We believe that these
features will enable our BeadArray technology to become a
leading platform for the emerging high-growth markets of SNP
genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines
fiber optic bundles and specially prepared beads that
self-assemble into an array. These fiber optic bundles can be
manufactured to contain thousands to millions of individual
fibers depending on the diameter of the bundle. In a separate
process, we create sensors by affixing a specific type of
molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a given
batch. The particular molecules on a bead define that
bead’s function as a sensor. We combine batches of beads
coated with specific molecules to form a pool specific to the
type of array we intend to create.

To form an array, we typically dip each fiber
optic bundle into a pool of coated beads. The coated beads are
drawn into the wells, one bead per well, on the end of each
fiber in the bundle. The tens of thousands of beads at the end
of the fiber optic bundle comprise our BeadArray. One may
perform an experiment by then dipping the BeadArray into a
prepared sample. The molecules in the sample bind to their
matching molecules on the coated bead. Since each bead performs
its own assay, we are able to make tens of thousands of
quantitative measurements simultaneously on each sample.

Our proprietary Oligator technology complements
our BeadArray technology. The Oligator synthesizes in parallel
many different short segments of DNA to meet the requirements of
large-scale genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator
technology is substantially more cost effective and provides
higher throughput than available commercial alternatives.

BeadArray Technology

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines
fiber optic bundles and specially prepared beads that
self-assemble into an array.

Fiber Optic Bundles.

We have the fiber optic bundles
manufactured to our specifications, which we cut into lengths of
less than one inch. Each bundle contains approximately 50,000
individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an
aluminum housing, which forms an Array of Arrays.



Microscopic Beads.

In a separate process, we create
sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the
billions of microscopic beads in a batch. We make different
batches of beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with
one particular type of molecule. The particular molecules on a
bead define that bead’s function as a sensor. For example,
we create a batch of SNP sensors by attaching a particular DNA
sequence to each bead in the batch. We combine batches of coated
beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to
create. A bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient
beads to produce thousands of arrays. One of the advantages of
this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays
for SNP genotyping. All of our SNP genotyping arrays are
manufactured with the same set of sensors. This allows us to
manufacture one type of array and by varying the reagent kit,
still be able to use it to test for any combinations of SNPs.

Array Self-Assembly and Decoding.

To form an array we typically dip each
fiber optic bundle into a pool of coated beads. The coated beads
are drawn into the wells, one bead per well, on the end of each
fiber in the bundle. We call this process self-assembly. The
tens of thousands of beads at the end of the fiber optic bundle
comprise our BeadArray. Because the beads assemble randomly into
the wells, we perform a final procedure called decoding in order
to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array.
We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, a process
that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the
array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding process is a
validation of each bead in the array. This quality control test
characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and
eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure that each bead type
on the array is sufficiently represented by having multiple
copies of each bead type. This improves the reliability and
accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical
processing of the results of identical beads.

Array Use in Experiments.

One performs an experiment on the
BeadArray by preparing a sample, such as DNA from a patient, and
introducing it to the array. The design features of our
BeadArray allow it to be simply dipped into a solution
containing the sample. The molecules in the sample bind to their
matching molecules on the coated bead. An analytical instrument
detects the matched molecules by shining a laser through the
fiber optic bundle. Since the molecules in the sample have a
structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser,
detection of a binding event is possible. This allows the
measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated
bead, resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample.

Oligator Technology

Genomic applications require many different short
pieces of DNA that can be made synthetically, called
oligonucleotides. For example, SNP genotyping typically requires
three to four different oligonucleotides per assay. A SNP
genotyping experiment analyzing 10,000 SNPs may therefore
require 30,000 to 40,000 different oligonucleotides,
contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment.

We have designed our proprietary Oligator
technology for the parallel synthesis of many different
oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of large-scale
genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology
is substantially more cost effective and provides higher
throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our
technology utilizes centrifugation for the automated parallel
synthesis of oligonucleotides within each machine. Depending on
the length of the oligonucleotide, each machine can synthesize
up to approximately 1600 oligonucleotides per day. We believe we
can expand this technology in the future and produce instruments
with substantially greater capacity.

Key Advantages of Our BeadArray and
	Oligator Technologies

We believe that our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies provide distinct advantages, in a variety of
applications, over competing technologies, by creating
cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the following
advantages:

High Throughput.

The
miniaturization of our BeadArray provides significantly greater
information content per unit area than any other array known to
us. To further increase throughput, we have formatted our arrays
in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter
plates, allowing throughput levels of up to 3 million
unique assays per microtiter plate. The Oligator’s parallel
synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of
oligonucleotides necessary to support large-scale genomic
applications.



Cost Effectiveness.

Our BeadArray substantially reduces
the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary
manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost
reductions generated by advances in fiber optics, digital
imaging and bead chemistry. In addition, our miniaturized
BeadArray requires smaller volumes than other array
technologies, and therefore reduces reagent costs. Our Oligator
technology further reduces reagent costs, as well as the cost of
coating beads.

Flexibility.

A wide
variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching
different molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and other
chemicals to beads. By using beads, we are able to take
advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of
sensors, which we assemble into arrays using the same
proprietary manufacturing process. In addition, we can have
fiber optic bundles manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes
and organized in various arrangements to optimize them for
different markets and market segments. In combination, the use
of beads and fiber optic bundles provides the flexibility and
scalability for our BeadArray technology to be tailored to
perform many applications in many different market segments,
from drug discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology
allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and
quantities of oligonucleotides.

Accuracy.

The high
density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple
copies of each individual bead type. We measure the copies
simultaneously and combine them into one data point. This allows
us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population
of identical beads, which permits the statistical calculation of
a more reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally,
the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding
step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead
on every array, improving the overall accuracy of the data.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray platform the
industry standard for products and services utilizing array
technologies. We plan to achieve this by:

Products and Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray
technology, the Array of Arrays, will be a disposable cassette
with 96 fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that
matches the standard 96-well microtiter plate. Each fiber optic
bundle will perform up to 2,000 unique assays. Therefore, one
Array of Arrays can perform up to 192,000 individual assays
simultaneously, more than any other array system known to us.

By simply increasing the number of fiber optic
bundles in the cassette, we can expand the Array of Arrays to
match standard 384-well and 1,536-well microtiter plates. In
these configurations, the Array of Arrays will be able to
simultaneously perform approximately 768,000 and 3,072,000
unique assays, respectively.

We intend to provide both products and services
using our proprietary BeadArray platform. In partnership with
Applied Biosystems, we are developing our first products based
on our Array of Arrays. These products will include disposable
Array of Arrays, reagent kits for SNP genotyping and instruments
that automatically read data from our Array of Arrays.

SNP Genotyping

During 2001, we introduced the first commercial
application of our BeadArray technology by launching our SNP
genotyping services business. We believe our genotyping
facility, which can perform one million



genotypes a day, has the highest throughput
capability in the industry. During 2001, we signed our first
services contract with GlaxoSmithKline and to date we have
entered into six additional services contracts.

We are designing our first consumable Array of
Arrays product for SNP genotyping. This product is being
developed in collaboration with our partner, Applied Biosystems
and will use their proprietary OLA zip code assay format. The
Array of Arrays will use a universal format that will allow it
to analyze any set of SNPs. Illumina will manufacture the arrays
and Applied Biosystems will manufacture the instrument and
reagent kits and have responsibility for sales and marketing of
the system. We expect this system to be commercialized by
Applied Biosystems in mid-2002.

Gene Expression Profiling

We will design our first product for gene
expression profiling to test selected sets of approximately 100
to 2,000 genes on large numbers of samples. We believe that
there is currently a need for a cost-effective and
high-throughput gene expression profiling technology to analyze
the activity of selected sets of genes from many samples
simultaneously.

High-Throughput Synthesis

We have put in place an oligonucleotide
manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of
producing five million oligonucleotides per year. In addition to
their use to coat beads, these oligonucleotides may be
components of the reagent kits for our BeadArray products and
used for assay development. Because our production capacity
exceeds our current internal needs for oligonucleotides, we
began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in
2001. We can provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths
and in several scales, with the ability to add many types of
modifications. We offer a range of quality control options and
have implemented a laboratory information management system to
control much of the manufacturing process. We believe our
proprietary Oligator technology is more cost effective than
competing technologies allowing us the ability to market our
oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy.

Scanning Instrumentation

In order to expand our business into additional
areas of genetic analysis beyond SNP genotyping, we are
developing a confocal laser scanning instrument that will
integrate with our BeadArray technology. We plan to
commercialize this instrument by the end of 2002.

Partnerships and Collaborations

We have entered into the following strategic
agreements with commercial entities to expand the functionality
of our BeadArray technology and to provide distribution channels
for the commercialization of our products and services:

Applied Biosystems, a Division of Applera
Corporation.

In November 1999, we
entered into a partnership with Applied Biosystems, a leading
supplier of instruments and reagents to the life sciences and
pharmaceutical industries. Illumina and Applied Biosystems will
jointly implement Applied Biosystems’ proprietary OLA
ZipCode assay format on Illumina’s proprietary Array of
Arrays for SNP genotyping. We will develop and manufacture the
Array of Arrays and Applied Biosystems will develop and
manufacture the detection instrument and the reagent kits.
Applied Biosystems and Illumina will co-brand products and
Applied Biosystems will distribute them through their worldwide
sales channels.

In connection with this partnership, Applera
Corporation invested $5.0 million to purchase shares of our
preferred stock and has provided us with substantial research
and development support through 2001. Illumina and Applied
Biosystems will divide the profits from all partnership
products, including instruments, array cassettes and reagent
kits, after both parties have received repayment for
cost-of-goods and sales and marketing expenses.

Chevron U.S.A.

In
January 2001 we signed a research collaboration agreement with
Chevron to develop a BeadArray designed to perform leak
detection and discrimination of gasoline grades in the petroleum
and



petrochemical industries. The agreement was
extended in January 2002. We retain all rights to commercialize
any resulting products.

We also have entered into collaborations with
Tufts University, The Australian National University, Stanford
University and The University of California, San Diego to
develop new applications for our BeadArray technology.

Research and Development

We have made substantial investments in research
and development since our inception. We have assembled a team of
skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
complete the development of our products. Our research and
development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies so that we
can commercialize the initial products and services derived from
these technologies. These efforts include among others:

Our research and development expenses for the
fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 (exclusive of charges relating
to stock based compensation) were $20.7 million,
$13.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We
expect research and development expense to increase in the
future as we continue to expand our research and product
development efforts.

Government Grants

Government grants allow us to fund internal
scientific programs and exploratory research. We retain
ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights
generated during these projects, subject to a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, paid-up license to practice, for or on behalf
of the United States, inventions made with federal funds. This
license is retained by the U.S. government as provided by
applicable statutes and



regulations. We do not believe that the retained
license will have any impact on our ability to market our
products. We do not need government approval to enter into
collaborations or other relationships with third parties. We
have six grants from the National Institutes of Health.

Intellectual Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including
ownership of, or exclusive licenses to, 17 issued
U.S. patents and 60 pending U.S. patent applications,
including two allowed applications, some of which derive from a
common parent application. Our issued patents, which cover fiber
optic arrays, bead array technology and chemical detection,
expire between 2010 and 2018. We are seeking to extend this
patent protection on our BeadArray, Oligator and related
technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for many of
these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
copyright and trademark protection, as well as continuing
technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend
in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our
products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade
secrets, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of
third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling
technology or products used with our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies.

We are party to various exclusive and
non-exclusive license agreements with third parties, which grant
us rights to use key aspects of our BeadArray, Oligator and
instrument technologies. For example, we have an exclusive
license from Tufts University to patents filed by Dr. David
Walt, a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our
Scientific Advisory Board and one of our founders. Our exclusive
licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents,
which will occur between 2010 and 2017. These exclusive licenses
are critical to our business. We also have a non-exclusive
license with Amersham Biosciences covering certain patents
related to confocal scanning instrumentation.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our Array of Arrays and
oligonucleotides in-house and can currently manufacture these in
sufficient quantity to meet internal and external needs. We
intend to rely upon Applied Biosystems to manufacture the
imaging system and reagent kits for the collaboration SNP
genotyping product that is expected to launch in mid-2002. We
initially intend to develop in-house manufacturing capability
for scanning instruments. We currently depend upon outside
suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our
BeadArrays and Array of Arrays. We intend to continue, and may
extend, the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process
to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best
commercial interests.

During 2001, we moved into a new facility which
allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific
processes, and optimize material flow and personnel movement. In
addition, we have implemented custom laboratory information
management systems for many of our manufacturing and services
operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use. We
adhere to access and safety standards required by federal, state
and local health ordinances, such as standards for the use,
handling and disposal of hazardous substances.

Competition

Although we expect that our BeadArray products
and services will provide significant advantages over currently
available products and services, we expect to encounter intense
competition from other companies that offer products and
services for the SNP genotyping, gene expression and proteomics
markets. These include companies such as Aclara Biosciences,
Affymetrix, Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Caliper Technologies,
Luminex, Motorola, Orchid Bioscience, Sequenom and Third Wave
Technologies. Many of these companies have or will have
substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other
resources and larger, more established marketing, sales,
distribution and service organizations than we do. In addition,
they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets
we need to address. Each of these markets is very competitive
and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of
competition to increase in the future. In order to effectively
compete with these companies, we will need to demonstrate that
our products



have superior throughput, cost and accuracy
advantages over the existing products. Rapid technological
development may result in our products or technologies becoming
obsolete. Products offered by us could be made obsolete either
by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or
other technologies. Although we believe that our technology will
provide advantages to our products that will make them unique
and enable us to compete effectively with these companies, we
cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Employees

As of December 30, 2001, we had a total of
179 employees, 55 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 106 of
whom are engaged in full-time research and development
activities. We plan to expand our research and development
programs as well as corporate collaborations and will hire
additional staff as these initiatives are implemented. None of
our employees is represented by a labor union. We consider our
employee relations to be positive.

Properties.

Our principal research and development,
manufacturing and administrative facilities occupy approximately
90,000 square feet of a newly constructed building in San Diego,
California, which we purchased, along with eight acres of
adjacent land, in January 2002. In addition, we lease a total of
26,000 square feet to two



tenants in this building as well as an adjacent
building on our property. The land has been approved for
construction of a third building. We expect that these
facilities, including the potential third building, will be
sufficient for our San Diego based operations for the
foreseeable future.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings.

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an
unspecified amount was filed against us by Anthony W.
Czarnik in the Superior Court of the State of California in
connection with the termination of Dr. Czarnik’s
employment with Illumina. The case is set for trial on

those discussed elsewhere.

Overview

Illumina, Inc. was incorporated in April 1998. We
are developing next-generation tools that will permit the
large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function. Our
proprietary BeadArray

TM

technology will provide the
throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical
industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract
medically valuable information from advances in genomics. This
information will correlate genetic variation and gene function
with particular disease states, enhancing drug discovery,
allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically
and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients.
In addition to the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries,
our technology will have applicability across a wide variety of
industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals and food,
flavor and beverages. In the first quarter of 2001, we began
commercial sale of custom oligonucleotides manufactured using
our proprietary Oligator

TM

technology. In the second
quarter of 2001, we initiated our SNP genotyping services
business by entering into a contract with GlaxoSmithKline and we
have since entered into six additional services contacts.

In November 1999, we entered into a strategic
partnership with Applied Biosystems under which our
BeadArray

TM

technology will be commercialized
together with instruments, reagents and software manufactured
and distributed by Applied Biosystems. We expect to
commercialize the first products under this partnership in
mid-2002.

To date most of our revenues have been generated
from government grants from the National Institutes of Health.
As a result of the 2001 launch of our SNP genotyping services
and custom oligonucleotide business, we generated product and
service revenue of approximately $1.0 million during 2001.
We are seeking to expand our customer base for these products
and services, and we expect that Applied Biosystems will launch
our collaboration SNP genotyping product in mid-2002. However,
we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful.

We have incurred substantial operating losses
since our inception. As of December 30, 2001, our
accumulated deficit was $50.1 million, and total
stockholders’ equity was $106.8 million. These losses
have



principally occurred as a result of the
substantial resources required for the research, development and
manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our
products. We expect to continue to incur substantial and
increasing costs for these activities over the next several
years and to increase our selling, general and administrative
costs as we begin to build up our sales and marketing
infrastructure to expand and support the sale of products. As a
result, we will need to increase revenue significantly to
achieve profitability.

Under our agreement with Applied Biosystems, we
will receive a share of the profit earned on all components of
the genotyping system sold by Applied Biosystems. Applied
Biosystems also agreed to provide $10.0 million of
non-refundable development support funding all of which has been
received as of December 30, 2001. This funding has been
recorded as deferred revenue, which will become realized at a
rate of 25% of the total profit share we earn from sales of
collaboration products. The remaining 75% of the profit share
will be payable in cash by Applied Biosystems.

Results of Operations

Comparison of Years Ended December 30,
	2001 and December 31, 2000

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 30,
2001 and December 31, 2000 was $2.5 million and
$1.3 million, respectively. Government grants and other
research funding accounted for approximately 60% and 97% of our
total revenue for the years ended December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively. We expect grant revenue to
generally decline as a proportion of total revenue over the next
few years as product and service revenue becomes a more
important part of our business. In 2001, we began sales of
custom oligonucleotides and most of the product revenue for this
year was derived from those sales.

Research and Development Expenses

Our research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses,
facility costs and laboratory and manufacturing supplies.
Research and development expenses increased $7.2 million to
$20.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2001,
from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The increase in costs over 2000 was primarily driven by higher
headcount, related personnel costs and higher laboratory and
manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our
BeadArray technology, which is the underlying technology on
which Illumina was founded. During 2001, our research activities
in this area increased $5.5 million over 2000. These additional
resources involved exploring and optimizing assays for various
types of genetic analysis experiments, increasing the
multiplexing level of our arrays, continuing development of the
scanning instrumentation required to read our arrays and
building up and testing our BeadArray based SNP genotyping
services system. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase
over 2000 was to support our Oligator technology platform, where
we more than doubled our total manufacturing capacity to five
million oligonucleotides per year through the development of a
new version of our Oligator synthesizer. The remaining
$1.2 million of expense increase was related to
manufacturing process improvement activities mostly related to
automating various parts of the manufacturing process to improve
yields, cost, quality and processing time. We expect that our
research and development expenses, including facilities related
costs, will increase substantially in future years to support
our collaborative research programs, internal product research
and technology development.

General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing,
finance, human resources, business development and general
management, as well as professional fees, such as expenses for
legal and accounting services. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $1.5 million to
$5.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2001,
from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2000. A portion of this increase was due to increases in the
sales and marketing costs required to launch and support our
custom oligonucleotide sales and SNP genotyping services
operations. The remaining increase was due to personnel and
other costs associated with our transition to a public company
and to support our growth as well as higher legal costs. We
expect that our selling, general and administrative



expenses will increase as we expand our staff,
add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional
costs to support our growth.

Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
	Other Non-Cash Compensation Charges

From our inception through July 25, 2000, in
connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of
restricted stock to employees, founders and directors, we have
recorded deferred stock compensation totaling
$17.8 million, representing the difference between the
exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common
stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date
such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was
sold. We recorded this amount as a component of
stockholders’ equity and amortize the amount as a charge to
operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and
options. We recorded amortization of this deferred compensation
of $5.0 million and $5.4 million for the years ended
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.
Subsequent to July 25, 2000, no deferred compensation has
been recorded as all options have been granted at fair market
value.

For employees, founders and directors, deferred
compensation represents the difference between the exercise
price of the option or purchase price of the stock and the
deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
and its related interpretations. For consultants, deferred
compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options
granted or stock sold in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 and is periodically remeasured
and expensed in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
No. 96-18. In connection with the sale of restricted common
stock to consultants, we recorded $0.3 million of expense for
the year ended December 31, 2000, which was expensed as our
rights to repurchase the common stock lapsed.

We recognize compensation expense over the
vesting period for employees, founders and directors, using an
accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28.
In February 2000, we modified all our consultant agreements to
include assurances that the contracts would be fulfilled. In
accordance with these modifications, we recorded additional
deferred compensation of $3.0 million as a component of
stockholders’ equity and amortize this amount as a charge
to operations ratably over the vesting periods of the restricted
stock and options. We recorded amortization of this deferred
compensation of approximately $0.9 million and
$0.8 million for the years ended December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively.

Interest Income, net

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents
and investments was $6.2 million and $4.7 million for the
years ended December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000,
respectively. Interest income increased in 2001 due to higher
average levels of invested funds partially offset by lower
effective interest rates. Interest expense was $0.7 million
for the year ended December 30, 2001 as compared to
$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Interest expense for the year ended December 30, 2001
resulted primarily from a construction loan related to our new
facility and from a loan arrangement for purchases of capital
equipment. We expect interest expense to increase substantially
in future periods following the assumption of a
$26.0 million loan in January 2002 related to the purchase
of our new facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

We incurred net operating losses for the years
ended December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and
accordingly, we did not pay any federal or state income taxes.
We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of
the resulting net deferred tax asset, as the future realization
of the tax benefit is uncertain. As of December 30, 2001,
we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
tax purposes of approximately $22.2 million and $16.6
million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2020 and 2008.

We also had federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$1.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which
begin to expire in 2020, unless previously utilized.



Our utilization of the net operating losses and
credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations
pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
Code, and similar state provisions, as a result of changes in
our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in
the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to
utilization.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31,
	2000 and 1999

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 31,
2000 and 1999 was $1.3 million and $0.5 million,
respectively. Virtually all of our revenue for both years were
derived from government grants.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased
$9.5 million to $13.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000, from $4.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to
increased staffing and other personnel costs to support the
continued research and scale-up of our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies. Our technologies were in the early stages of
development in these years.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased
$2.9 million to $4.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $1.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This increases was primarily
attributable to an increase in administrative staffing necessary
to manage and support our growth.

Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
	Other Non-Cash Compensation Charges

In connection with the grant of stock options and
sale of restricted common stock to employees, founders and
directors, we recorded deferred compensation of approximately
$13.3 million and $4.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. We recorded
amortization of this deferred compensation of $5.4 million
and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. We recorded an additional
$0.3 million and $0.4 million of expense related to
restricted common stock sold to consultants for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, which is expensed
as our rights to repurchase the common stock lapse. We recorded
an additional $0.3 million charge to operations for the
acceleration of vesting of restricted stock during the year
ended December 31, 2000. In February 2000, we modified all
our consultant agreements to include assurances that the
contracts would be fulfilled. In accordance with these
modifications, we recorded additional deferred compensation of
$3.0 million as a component of stockholders’ equity
and amortize this amount as a charge to operations ratably over
the vesting periods of the restricted stock and options. We
recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of
$0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Interest Income, net

Interest income was $4.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to
$0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
increase in interest income was due to higher levels of invested
funds. Interest expense was $93,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000 as compared to $48,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 30, 2001, we had cash
(including restricted cash), cash equivalents and investments of
approximately $93.8 million. We currently invest our funds
in U.S. dollar based investment-grade corporate and government
debt securities with average maturities not exceeding
18 months.

Our operating activities used cash of
$10.9 million in the year ended December 30, 2001, as
compared to $14.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2000. Our use of cash for these periods
primarily resulted from losses from operations, excluding
amortization of non-cash charges, offset by receipt of funding
from



collaborators. Cash used in operations during
2000 included $8.5 million of payments made in connection
with a lease and purchase arrangement related to buildings we
purchased in 2002.

Our investing activities used cash of
$101.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2001 as
compared to providing cash of $6.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2000. The large use of cash for
investing activities in 2001 resulted from reinvesting
short-term cash equivalents into longer maturity investments.
Purchases of property and equipment increased approximately
$11.5 million as compared to the prior year period,
primarily due to higher purchases of manufacturing and research
equipment and progress payments for construction of a new
facility.

Our financing activities provided cash of
$0.7 million in the year ended December 30, 2001, as
compared to $103.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2000. Cash provided by financing activities in
2001 consisted primarily of sales of our stock through option
exercises and our employee stock purchase plan. In 2000, cash
provided from investing activities resulted primarily from the
sale of our stock through an initial public offering, which
raised approximately $101 million.

In October 1998, we entered into a
$1.0 million capital equipment lease financing arrangement
with a lease financing corporation. As of December 31,
1999, we had utilized all funds available under this lease
agreement. In April 2000, we entered into a $3.0 million
loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance
purchases of capital equipment, $1.7 million of which
remains available at December 30, 2001.

In July 2000, we entered into a 10-year lease to
rent space in two newly constructed buildings that we now
occupy. That lease contained an option to purchase the buildings
together with eight acres of adjacent land that has been
approved for construction of an additional building. At the time
the lease was executed, we provided the developer with a
$1.6 million letter of credit that was increased to
$3.1 million in the third quarter of 2001, and which was
secured by restricted cash. In addition, we provided the
developer $6.2 million of funding in the form of an
interest bearing, secured loan with a term of approximately one
year and a $0.5 million deposit. In December 2000, we paid
$2.3 million to execute the option to purchase the
buildings and related land. During the third quarter of 2001,
the term of the secured loan expired and the principal and
accrued interest thereon was applied to the purchase price for
the project. In addition, we made construction and other
progress payments of $7.1 million in the year ended
December 30, 2001. The purchase closed in January 2002, at
which time, the letter of credit was cancelled and we assumed a
$26.0 million, 10-year mortgage on the property at a fixed
interest rate of 8.36%.

At December 30, 2001, the total of annual
future minimum lease payments was $0.1 million and
$1.1 million under operating and capital lease
arrangements, respectively. These payments span one and three
years, respectively. Total future minimum principal and interest
payments under the mortgage we assumed in January 2002 are
$24.8 million, representing payments of approximately
$2.5 million per year for 10 years with a balloon
payment of $21.2 million due at the end of the 10-year term.

We expect that our current cash and cash
equivalents, investments and funding from existing strategic
alliances and grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated
operating needs for at least the next 24 months. However,
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our
available funds will depend on many factors, including
scientific progress in our research and development programs,
the magnitude of those programs, competing technological and
market developments, our ability to successfully commercialize
our first products in partnership with Applied Biosystems and to
expand our oligonucleotide and SNP genotyping services
businesses. Therefore, we may require additional funding within
this time frame and the additional funding, if needed, may not
be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
Further, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our
then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights.

Critical Accounting Policies

Since our inception, virtually all of our
activities have consisted of research and development efforts
related to developing our BeadArray and Oligator technologies.
We have recognized only a small amount of revenue during our
history, most of which has been derived from short term
government grants. Accordingly, the large majority of our
transactions to date have related to research and development
spending. We expense



all such expenditures in the period incurred.
Bulk quantities of laboratory supplies and manufacturing raw
materials are inventoried when acquired but expensed when placed
in use for research activities.

We have one significant collaborative agreement,
under which we received non-refundable research funding support
of $10.0 million through the end of 2001. All amounts
received under that agreement were recorded as deferred revenue
in accordance with SAB 101 and will not begin to be
realized until the collaboration’s products are
commercialized.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

and No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 141 requires all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted
for by the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer
amortized but are reviewed annually (or more frequently if
impairment indicators arise) for impairment. Separate intangible
assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no
maximum life). The amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 141 and No. 142 to have a significant impact on
our operating results or financial condition.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,

which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and supersedes
SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of,

and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30,

Reporting the Results of Operations for
a Disposal of a Segment of a Business.

We are required to
adopt SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002. We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a
significant impact on our operating results or financial
condition.

Factors Affecting Our Operating
Results

We have generated only a small amount of
	revenue from product sales to date. We expect to continue to
	incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain
	profitability.

We have incurred net losses since our inception
and expect to continue to incur net losses. At December 30,
2001, our accumulated deficit was approximately
$50.1 million. We expect to continue to have increasing net
losses and negative cash flow. The magnitude of our net losses
will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of our
revenue and on the level of our expenses. We expect to incur
significant expenses for research and development, for
developing our manufacturing capabilities and for efforts to
commercialize our products. As a result, we expect that our
operating expenses will increase significantly in the near term
and, consequently, we will need to generate significant
additional revenue to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve
profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

Our success depends upon the increasing
	availability of genetic information and the continued emergence
	and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and
	function.

We design our products primarily for applications
in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The
usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the
availability of genetic data. We are initially focusing on
markets for analysis of genetic variation and function, namely
SNP genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics. These
markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as we
anticipate, or reach their full potential. Other methods of
analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and
displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may
not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically
valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation
and function. If genetic data is not available or if our target
markets do not emerge in a timely manner, demand for our
products will not develop as we expect, and we may never become
profitable.



We have limited manufacturing experience.
	If we are unable to develop our manufacturing capability or find
	third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products, we may
	not be able to launch our products in a timely manner, or at
	all.

We have limited experience manufacturing our
products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve
significant commercial sales. To date, our manufacturing
activities for arrays have been limited to supplying
pre-commercial products for internal use by us and our
collaborative partners. We have only recently begun
manufacturing oligonucleotides for commercial sale and operating
our internal SNP genotyping service business. We have not yet
developed a commercial manufacturing process for scanning
instrumentation.

The nature of our products requires customized
components that currently are available from a limited number of
sources. For example, we currently obtain the fiber optic
bundles included in our products from a single source. If we are
unable to secure a sufficient supply of fiber optic bundles or
other product components, we will be unable to meet future
demand for our products. We will need to enter into contractual
relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production
of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on a timely
basis, for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable
terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain
reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable
costs.

We are an early stage company with no
	commercially available microarray products, and our success
	depends on our ability, alone or with our partners or
	collaborators, to develop commercially successful products and
	on market acceptance of our new and unproven
	technology.

We currently have no commercially available
microarray products. Our technologies are in the early stages of
development or commercialization. You should evaluate us in
light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early
stage company developing tools for the life sciences and
pharmaceutical industries.

Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical
companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a
variety of technologies. Compared to the existing technologies,
our technologies are new and unproven. In order to be
successful, our products must meet the commercial requirements
of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for
the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.

We may not be successful in the commercial
development of products. We must conduct a substantial amount of
additional research and development before some of our
microarray products will be ready for sale. In addition, we are
only at the early phase of offering custom oligonucleotides and
SNP genotyping services to the market. Problems frequently
encountered in connection with the development or early
commercialization of products using new and unproven
technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully
commercialize these products and services.

Market acceptance will depend on many factors,
including:



Commercialization of our technologies
	depends on partnerships and collaborations with other companies,
	in particular Applied Biosystems. If our current partnership and
	collaborations are not successful, or if we are not able to
	enter into additional partnerships and collaborations in the
	future, we may not be able to develop our technologies or
	products.

We currently do not possess all of the resources
or intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize
all the products or services that may result from our
technologies. We will need either to develop a sales, marketing
and support group with relevant experience or make appropriate
arrangements with strategic partners in order to market and sell
our products. In addition, we may need to enter into agreements
to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some
of our products or services. We have chosen to enter into an
arrangement to develop and commercialize our initial SNP
genotyping array product. We have entered into an agreement with
Applied Biosystems to gain access to their proprietary chemistry
format for use with the array products of the partnership and
are currently amending that agreement to more specifically
address the genotyping services portion of the partnership.
Applied Biosystems also will fund, in part, the development of
the array products. Our partnership agreement provides that
Applied Biosystems will develop the detection instrument and
reagent kits required for use with the genotyping array product,
and will provide sales and marketing support for those products.
If Applied Biosystems does not deliver the instrument in a
timely way or successfully market the genotyping system or if
Applied Biosystems elects to terminate or restrict the use of
intellectual property within our partnership, we may not be able
to develop or successfully commercialize our initial products or
services on a timely basis, or at all. For instance, in 2001 we
announced a delay in the introduction of our first product with
Applied Biosystems to mid-2002. We may need to work with other
corporate partners and collaborators to develop other chemistry
formats and to gain access to genetic data for use with our
technologies.

We have limited or no control over the resources
that any partner or collaborator may devote to our products. Any
of our present or future partners or collaborators may not
perform their obligations as expected. These partners or
collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us
or otherwise fail to meet their obligations or perform their
collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner.
Further, any of our partners or collaborators may elect not to
develop products arising out of our partnerships or
collaborations or devote sufficient resources to the
development, manufacture or commercialization of these products.
If any of these events occur, we may not be able to develop our
technologies or commercialize our products and our ability to
generate revenue will decrease.

Any inability to adequately protect our
	proprietary technologies could harm our competitive
	position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to
obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our
intellectual property in the United States and other countries.
If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately,
competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby
erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States, and many companies have
encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary
rights abroad. These problems can be caused by the absence of
rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights.

The patent positions of companies developing
tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries,
including our patent position, generally are uncertain and
involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to
protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third
parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are
covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
maintained as trade secrets. We will apply for patents covering
our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However,
our applications may be challenged and may not result in issued
patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain
may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing
our technologies or from developing competing products. There
also is risk that others may independently develop similar or
alternative technologies or design around our patented
technologies. Also, others may challenge or invalidate our
patents, or our patents may fail to provide us with any
competitive advantage. In addition, we may need to initiate
lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which would be
expensive and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our
intellectual property rights, which would reduce our ability to
compete in the marketplace.



We also rely upon trade secret protection for our
confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security
measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures,
however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. We seek to protect our
proprietary information by entering into confidentiality
agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants.
Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or consultants may still
disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to
meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade
secrets.

We expect intense competition in our target
	markets, which could render our products obsolete or
	substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This
	would limit our ability to compete and achieve
	profitability.

We compete with life sciences companies that
design, manufacture and market instruments for analysis of
genetic variation and function and other applications using
technologies such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary
electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
microfluidics, and mechanically deposited, inkjet and
photolithographic arrays. We anticipate that we will face
increased competition in the future as new companies enter the
market with new technologies. The markets for our products are
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, changes in customer needs, emerging competition and
new product introductions. One or more of our competitors may
render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Many of our
competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and
more experience in research and development than we have.
Furthermore, the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies,
which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could
develop competing products.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable
	to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to
	achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and
scientific personnel. The loss of their services could adversely
impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We will
need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in
molecular biology, chemistry and biological information
processing. We compete for qualified management and scientific
personnel with other biotechnology companies, universities and
research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.
Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Diego
area, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to
attract and retain management and scientific personnel would
prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our
products or technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional
expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the
products developed through our technologies, including the life
sciences and healthcare industries and molecular biology,
chemistry and biological information processing. Thus, we will
need to add new personnel, including management, and develop the
expertise of existing management. The failure to do so could
impair the growth of our business.

We may need additional capital in the
	future. If additional capital is not available on acceptable
	terms, we may have to curtail or cease operations.

Our future capital requirements will be
substantial and will depend on many factors including payments
received under collaborative agreements and government grants,
the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent
research and development projects, and the filing, prosecution
and enforcement of patent claims. We anticipate that our
existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently
planned operations for at least the next 24 months.
However, we premise this expectation on our current operating
plan, which may change as a result of many factors.
Consequently, we may need additional funding sooner than
anticipated. Our inability to raise capital would seriously harm
our business and product development efforts. In addition, we
may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions
or strategic considerations even if we believe we have
sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To
the



extent that additional capital is raised through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance
of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders.

We currently have no credit facility or committed
sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with
$1.7 million unused and available as of December 30,
2001. To the extent operating and capital resources are
insufficient to meet future requirements, we will have to raise
additional funds to continue the development and
commercialization of our technologies. These funds may not be
available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are
not available on attractive terms, we may be required to curtail
operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into
financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive
terms.

We expect that our results of operations
	will fluctuate. This fluctuation could cause our stock price to
	decline.

Our operating results have fluctuated in the past
and are likely to do so in the future. These fluctuations in our
operating results could cause our stock price to fluctuate
significantly or decline. A large portion of our expenses is
relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment
and personnel. In addition, we expect operating expenses to
continue to increase significantly in 2002. Accordingly, if
revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to
reduce our operating losses.

Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our
revenue and expenses, we believe that comparisons of our
operating results are not a good indication of our future
performance. For example, oligonucleotide sales may fluctuate
quarter to quarter depending on market conditions or
oligonucleotide needs for both our genotyping services business
and internal research. Our operating results may not meet the
expectations of stock market analysts and investors. In that
case, our stock price probably would decline.

Item
7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure about Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in
the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment
portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of
interest expense we must pay with respect to our various
outstanding debt instruments. Our risk associated with
fluctuating interest expense and income is limited to our
capital lease obligations, the interest rates under which are
closely tied to market rates, and our investments in interest
rate sensitive financial instruments. Under our current
policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to
manage exposure to interest rate changes. We ensure the safety
and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting
default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate
default risk by investing in investment grade securities. A
hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates
along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially
affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial
instruments. Declines in interest rates over time will, however,
reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates
over time will increase our interest expense.

Our equipment financings, amounting to
$0.9 million as of December 30, 2001, are all at fixed
rates and therefore, have minimal exposure to changes in
interest rates. In January 2002, we assumed a $26.0 million
mortgage in connection with the purchase of a new facility. The
interest rate on this loan is fixed for a 10-year period and
consequently there is no exposure to increasing market interest
rates.

We have operated primarily in the United States
and all transactions to date have been made in
U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have not had any material
exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations, nor do we have
any foreign currency hedging instruments in place.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Illumina, Inc. as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the
years ended December 30, 2001, December 31, 2000 and
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Illumina, Inc. at December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years ended December 30, 2001,
December 31, 2000 and 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the “Company”) was
incorporated on April 28, 1998. The Company is developing
next-generation tools that will permit the large-scale analysis
of genetic variation and function. The Company’s
proprietary BeadArray

TM

technology will provide the
throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical
industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract
medically valuable information from advances in genomics. This
information will correlate genetic variation and gene function
with particular disease states, enhancing drug discovery,
allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically
and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients.
In addition to the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries,
the Company’s technology will have applicability across a
wide variety of industries, including agriculture,
petrochemicals and food, flavor and beverages.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires that management make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and
expenses incurred during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three
months when purchased.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

to its investments. Under SFAS No. 115, the
Company classifies its investments as
“Available-for-Sale” and records such assets at
estimated fair value in the balance sheet, with unrealized gains
and losses, if any, reported in stockholders’ equity. The
Company invests its excess cash balances in marketable debt
securities, primarily government securities and corporate bonds
and notes, with strong credit ratings. The Company limits the
amount of investment exposure as to institutions, maturity and
investment type. The cost of securities sold is determined based
on the specific identification method. Realized gains, net of
losses, totaled $366,265 for the year ended December 30,
2001. There were no material realized gains or losses for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

At December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000, investments consist of the following (in thousands):

F-7


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Investment maturities at December 30, 2001
are as follows:

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of a money market fund
that is used as collateral against a letter of credit.

Fair Value of Financial
	Instruments

Financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are
carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair
value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard
cost (which approximates actual cost) or market. Inventories, as
of December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 represent
raw materials.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets
(generally three to seven years) using the straight-line method.

Acquired Technology Rights

Intangible assets consist of acquired technology
rights related to the acquisition of nGenetics in 1998. The
purchase price was $114,999, consisting of 124,152 shares of
Series B preferred stock, valued at $0.926 per share, the
selling price paid in cash by outside investors in a
contemporaneous sale of stock.

In accordance with Accounting Practice Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 17,

Accounting for
Intangible Assets,

the acquired technology rights of
$113,600 were recorded at cost. The rights related to the
acquired technology were amortized over its estimated useful
life (three years) and the Company has amortized $113,600
through December 30, 2001.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,

if indicators of
impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of the
affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying
value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted
future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the
Company measures the

F-8


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

future cash flows associated with the use of the
asset and adjusts the value of the asset accordingly. While the
Company’s current and historical operating and cash flow
losses are indicators of impairment, the Company believes the
future cash flows to be received from the long-lived assets will
exceed the assets’ carrying value, and accordingly the
Company has not recognized any impairment losses through
December 30, 2001.

Revenue Recognition

The Company has two primary sources of revenue,
which are product sales and government grants. Product revenues
primarily consist of revenues from the sales of oligonucleotides
and revenues are recognized upon shipment and passage of title.
The Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following
criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an
arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the products and/or
services has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or
determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably
assured. In addition, the Company complies with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements (“SAB 101”), which became
effective in the fourth quarter of 2000. SAB 101 sets forth
guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon
factors such as passage of title, installation, payment and
customer acceptance.

Revenue from government grants is recognized on a
percentage of completion basis as related costs are incurred,
provided that amounts earned are not subject to refund if the
research is unsuccessful. Any payments received in advance of
the Company completing its performance obligations with respect
to earning revenue are deferred in accordance with SAB 101 until
the related performance obligations have been completed.

Research and Development

Expenditures relating to research and development
are expensed in the period incurred.

Income Taxes

Current income tax expense is the amount of
income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A
deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the
expected future impact of differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as
the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense is generally
the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset
or liability. Valuation allowances are established when
realizability of deferred tax assets is uncertain. The effect of
tax rate changes is reflected in tax expense during the period
in which such changes are enacted.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,

the Company accounts for
common stock options granted, and restricted stock sold, to
employees, founders and directors using the intrinsic value
method and, thus, recognizes no compensation expense for options
granted, or restricted stock sold, with exercise prices equal to
or greater than the fair value of the Company’s common
stock on the date of the grant. The Company has recorded
deferred stock compensation related to certain stock options,
and restricted stock, which were granted with exercise prices
below estimated fair value (see Note 3), which is being
amortized on an accelerated amortization methodology in
accordance with FIN 28.

Deferred compensation for options granted, and
restricted stock sold, to consultants has been determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18 as the fair

Comprehensive Loss

In accordance with SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

the Company has disclosed
comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Net Loss Per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share are
presented in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
Share,

and SAB 98, for all periods presented. Under the
provisions of SAB 98, common stock and convertible preferred
stock that has been issued or granted for nominal consideration
prior to the anticipated effective date of the initial public
offering must be included in the calculation of basic and
diluted net loss per common share as if these shares had been
outstanding for all periods presented. To date, the Company has
not issued or granted shares for nominal consideration.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic and
diluted net loss per share has been computed using the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Pro forma
basic and diluted net loss per common share, as presented in the
statements of operations, has been computed as described above,
and also gives effect to the conversion of preferred stock into
common stock (using the “as if converted” method) from
the original date of issuance.

The following table presents the calculation of
net loss per share (in thousands except per share data):

The Company has excluded all convertible
preferred stock, outstanding stock options and warrants, and
shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of diluted
loss per common share because all such securities are
antidilutive for all periods presented. The total number of
shares excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per
share, prior to application of the treasury stock method for
options and warrants, was 5,352,950, 4,482,069 and 22,649,271
for the years ended December 30, 2001, December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Effect of New Accounting
	Standards

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

which requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations
subsequent to June 30, 2001 and specifies criteria for
recognizing intangible assets acquired in a business
combination. The impact on the financial statements is not
material.

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

which establishes a
new basis for accounting for intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives. Such assets are no longer amortized but are
reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently, if
indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with definite
useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives. This statement is required to be adopted
by companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. The Company intends to adopt the new Statement effective
January 1, 2002. The impact on the financial statements is
not material.

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,

which
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of
the related long-lived asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement
cost should be allocated to expense using a systematic and
rational method. This Statement is required to be adopted by
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2002. The impact on the financial statements is not material.

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,

which supercedes, with exceptions, SFAS
No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

. SFAS 144
retains the basic indicators of impairment recognition and
undiscounted cash-flow measurement model of SFAS No. 121,
however, it removes goodwill from the scope of the analysis, as
the accounting for goodwill is now subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 141 and 142. SFAS No. 144 also provides
additional guidance on differentiating between assets held and
used, held for sale, and held for disposal other than by sale.
This Statement is required to be adopted by companies for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company
intends to adopt the new Statement effective January 1,
2002. The impact on the financial statements is not material.

Stock Options

In June 2000, the Company’s board of
directors and stockholders adopted the 2000 Stock Plan. The 2000
Stock Plan amended and restated the 1998 Incentive Stock Plan
and increased the shares reserved for issuance by 4,000,000
shares. In addition, the 2000 Stock Plan provides for an
automatic annual increase in the shares reserved for issuance by
the lesser of 5% of outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
year, 1,500,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined by
the Company’s board of directors.

In 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Incentive
Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and had reserved 5,750,000
shares of common stock for grants under the Plan. The Plan
provides for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory stock
options, stock bonuses and rights to purchase stock to
employees, directors or consultants of the Company. The Plan
provides that incentive stock options will be granted only to
employees at no less than the fair value of the Company’s
common stock, as determined by the board of directors at the
date of the grant. Options generally vest 20% one year from the
date of grant and ratably each month thereafter for a period of
48 months and expire ten years from date of grant. In
December 1999, the Company modified the plan to allow for
acceleration of vesting in the event of an acquisition or merger.

A summary of the Company’s stock option
activity from April 28, 1998 (inception) through
December 30, 2001 follows:

At December 30, 2001, options to purchase
approximately 321,696 shares were exercisable and 4,604,697
shares remain available for future grant.

Following is a further breakdown of the options
outstanding as of December 30, 2001:

Pro forma information regarding net loss is
required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the
fair value method of that statement. The fair value for these
options was estimated at the dates of grant using the fair value
option pricing model (Black Scholes) with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2001, 2000, and 1999:
(a) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 4.0% to
6.5%, (b) expected dividend yield of 0%,
(c) anticipated volatility of 70% and (d) five year
estimated life of the options.

For purposes of adjusted pro forma disclosures,
the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the vesting period. The Company’s adjusted pro forma
information is as follows (in thousands except per share
amounts):

The pro forma effect on net loss presented is not
likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on reported
net income or loss in future years because these amounts reflect
less than five years of vesting.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase
	Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and
stockholders adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“Purchase Plan”). A total of 1,458,946 shares of the
Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only
through payroll deductions, during defined offering periods. The
price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is
equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
The initial offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition,
the Purchase Plan provides for annual increases of shares
available for issuance under the Purchase Plan beginning with
fiscal 2001. 64,674 shares were issued under the 2000 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 2001.

Deferred Stock Compensation

Since the inception of the Company, in connection
with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted
stock to employees, founders and directors through July 25,
2000, the Company has recorded deferred stock compensation
totaling approximately $17.8 million, representing the
difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair
value of the Company’s common stock as estimated by the
Company’s

F-14


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

management for financial reporting purposes on
the date such stock options were granted or restricted common
stock was sold. Deferred compensation is included as a reduction
of stockholders’ equity and is being amortized to expense
over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock.
During the year ended December 30, 2001, the Company
recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of
approximately $5.0 million.

In February 2000, the Company modified the
consulting agreements with all of its outside consultants. Under
the modified consulting agreements, the consultants agreed to
pay a substantial financial penalty if they did not fulfill
their performance obligations under the agreements. The amount
of the penalty was determined for each consultant based on the
intrinsic value of the unvested restricted common stock based on
the original purchase price and the fair value of the common
stock as estimated by the Company’s management for
financial reporting purposes on the date of modification. Each
consultant had already vested in a portion of the original
restricted common stock in accordance with the services already
provided, and the amounts related to the vested common stock was
expensed. The deferred consultant compensation related to the
unvested stock of $3.0 million was recorded in February
2000 and will be amortized ratably over the contracted service
periods. The Company amortized approximately $0.9 million
of this deferred compensation in the year ended
December 30, 2001.

The following is a breakdown of the amortization
of deferred compensation and other non-cash charges (in
thousands):

4.     Collaborative
Agreements

Applera Corporation

In November 1999, the Company signed a
collaborative agreement with Applera Corporation through its
Applied Biosystems unit (“ABI”) under which both
companies will perform certain research activities with an
objective of developing and commercializing products utilizing
the Company’s technology. In conjunction with the
agreement, ABI purchased 1,250,000 shares of Series C
convertible preferred stock at $4.00 per share. Under the
agreement, ABI agreed to provide the Company with non-refundable
research and development support, all of which has been provided
as of December 30, 2001. Upon commercialization of the
products developed under the collaboration, the Company will
share in the operating profits resulting from the sale of such
products. The Company has deferred recognition of revenue from
the research funding of $10,000,000 provided by ABI, and will
recognize such amounts as revenue at the rate of 25% of the
total profit share the Company earns from the sales of
collaborative products.

Other Agreements

The Company has various research agreements with
several commercial, governmental and academic organizations for
which the Company performs research activities. These
organizations fund the research efforts, the revenue for which
is recognized as the procedures are performed.

5.     Asset and
Technology Purchase

In March 2000, the Company signed an agreement to
acquire certain tangible assets and rights to certain in-process
technologies in exchange for $100,000 and 175,000 shares of
common stock valued at $1,575,000 ($9.00 per share). The Company
recorded the tangible assets at their fair value of
approximately $50,000. As of the date these technologies were
acquired, they had not achieved technological or commercial
feasibility and there is no significant alternative future use
should the Company’s development efforts prove
unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Company recorded an acquired
in-process technology charge of $1,625,000 in March 2000 related
to the purchase of these technologies.

Four projects were acquired in the purchase of
these technologies. Three projects are related to the
development of instrumentation for oligonucleotide synthesis.
These three projects differ in the size and capacity of the
instrumentation. The first of these projects was approximately
50% complete at the date of acquisition and was completed in
approximately nine months at a cost of $1.0 million.
Revenue from this project commenced in February 2001. The
remaining three projects were approximately 20%, 10% and 20%
complete at the date of acquisition and have no projected
completion date at this time.

6.     Commitments

Building Loan

In July 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year
lease to rent space in two newly constructed buildings that are
now occupied by the Company. That lease contained an option to
purchase the buildings together with certain adjacent land that
has been approved for construction of an additional building. At
the time the lease was executed, the Company provided the
developer with a $1.6 million letter of credit that was
increased to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2001, and
which was secured by restricted cash. In addition the Company
provided the developer $6.2 million of funding in the form
of an interest bearing, secured loan with a term of
approximately one year and a $0.5 million deposit. In
December 2000, the Company paid $2.3 million to execute the
option to purchase the buildings and related land. During the
third quarter of 2001, the term of the secured loan expired and
the principal and accrued interest thereon was applied to the
purchase price for the project. In addition, the Company made
construction and other progress payments of $7.1 million in
the year ended December 30, 2001. The purchase closed in
January 2002, at which time, the letter of credit was cancelled
and the Company assumed a $26 million, 10-year mortgage on
the property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%.

The Company will make payments under the loan
totaling $2.3 million in 2002 and $2.5 million per
year thereafter until the loan expires in January 2012 at which
time a balloon payment of $21.2 million will be due.

Leases

In October 1998, the Company entered into a
$1,000,000 lease financing arrangement with a lease financing
corporation. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had
utilized all funds available under the lease arrangement. In
April 2000, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 loan
arrangement to be used at its discretion to finance purchases of
capital equipment. The loan is secured by the capital equipment
financed. As of December 31, 2001, $1,682,318 remains
available under this loan arrangement. Cost and accumulated
depreciation of equipment under capital leases at
December 30, 2001 is $1,317,682 and $584,925, respectively.
Depreciation of equipment under capital leases are included in
depreciation expense.
