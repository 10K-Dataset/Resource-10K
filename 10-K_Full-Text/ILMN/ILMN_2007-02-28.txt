Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    next-generation life science tools and integrated systems for
    the large scale analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a
    comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve
    the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets, and we
    expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. Our
    customers include leading genomic research centers,
    pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical
    research organizations and biotechnology companies. Our tools
    provide researchers around the world with the performance,
    throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
    perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable
    medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We
    believe this information will enable researchers to correlate
    genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance
    drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be
    detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for
    individual patients.



On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    Solexa, Inc. (Solexa) for approximately 13.1 million shares
    of our common stock. Solexa develops and commercializes genetic
    analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses,
    including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis
    and small RNA analysis. We believe our combined company is the
    only company with genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene
    expression and sequencing, the three cornerstones of modern
    genetic analysis.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998. We
    reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal executive
    offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego,
    California 92121. Our telephone number is

(858) 202-4500.

Industry
    Background

Genetic
    Variation and Biological Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each
    parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical, or they
    may be different. These differences are referred to as genetic
    variation. Examples of the physical consequences of genetic
    variation include differences in eye and hair color. Genetic
    variation can also have important medical consequences. Genetic
    variation affects disease susceptibility, including
    predisposition to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
    Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
    cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment.
    Some people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
    still others may experience adverse side effects. A common form
    of genetic variation is a single-nucleotide polymorphism, or
    SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position in a DNA
    sequence. It is estimated that the human genome contains over
    nine million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for
    medically important effects, it is now believed that
    combinations of SNPs may contribute to the development of most
    major diseases. Since there are millions of SNPs, it is
    important to investigate many representative, well-chosen SNPs
    simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable
    information.

Another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over- or
    under-expression of genes within an organism’s cells. A
    very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in
    complex organisms. The challenge for scientists is to delineate
    the associated genes’ expression patterns and their
    relationship to disease. Until recently, this problem was
    addressed by investigating effects on a

gene-by-gene

basis. This is time consuming, and difficulties exist when
    several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at
    the same time. With the advent of microarray technology,
    thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time.

SNP
    Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining which base (A, C, G
    or T) is present at a particular site in the genome within
    an individual or other organism. The use of SNP genotyping to
    obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual SNP
    or a collection of SNPs, and to apply that information to
    clinical trials and diagnostic testing, requires the analysis of
    millions of SNP genotypes and the testing of large populations
    for each disease. For example, a single large clinical trial
    could involve genotyping 300,000 SNPs per patient in
    1,000 patients, thus requiring 300 million assays.
    Using previously available technologies, this scale of SNP
    genotyping was both impractical and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping can be used in a variety of ways,
    including studies designed to understand the genetic
    contributions to disease (disease association studies),
    genomics-based drug development, clinical trial analysis,
    disease predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP
    genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare, for example
    in the development of plants and animals with desirable
    commercial characteristics. These markets will require billions
    of SNP genotyping assays annually.



Gene
    Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which
    genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is
    accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary messenger
    between genes (DNA) and proteins. Variation in gene expression
    can cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease
    or predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression
    patterns between cells from different environments, such as
    normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or
    absence of a drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a
    role in these processes can be identified. Studies of this type,
    often used in drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and
    preferably tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of
    samples. Once a smaller set of genes of interest has been
    identified, researchers can then examine how these genes are
    expressed or suppressed across numerous samples, for example,
    within a clinical trial.

As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases,
    gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important
    diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is
    anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the
    sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more
    cost-effective technologies.

Sequencing

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases
    (A, C, G or T) in a DNA sample, which can be further
    divided into de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, and tag
    sequencing. In de novo sequencing, the goal is to determine the
    sequence of a representative individual from a species never
    before sequenced. Understanding the similarities and differences
    in DNA sequence between many species can help to improve our
    understanding of the function of the structures found in the DNA.

In re-sequencing, one determines the sequences of many
    individuals from the same species, generally comparing each to a
    standard or reference sequence. This is an extremely
    comprehensive form of genotyping, in which every single base is
    characterized for possible mutations. Mutations tend to fall in
    two categories: those which occur fairly frequently at a tiny
    fraction of bases (e.g. at about 0.1% of bases in humans), and
    those which occur much less frequently but at a large number of
    locations. Both types can contribute to diseases. Genotyping can
    subsequently be used to characterize the former, but
    re-sequencing is used to assay the latter. With the merger of
    Illumina and Solexa, we will have

state-of-the-art

technologies for both.

In tag sequencing, short sequences, each representative of a
    larger molecule or genomic location, are detected and counted.
    In these applications, the number of times that each tag is seen
    provides quantification of an underlying biological process. As
    an example, in digital gene expression, one tag sequence may
    exist for each gene, and the number of copies of this tag which
    are detected in an experiment is a measure of how actively that
    gene is being expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed.



Our
    Technologies

BeadArray
    Technology

We have developed a proprietary array technology that enables
    the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads
    and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to
    produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our
    BeadArray technology provides a unique combination of high
    throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We achieve high
    throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we
    are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match
    the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various
    configurations in the format of standard microscope slides. We
    seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of
    expensive reagents and valuable samples, and through the low
    manufacturing costs associated with our technologies. Our
    ability to vary the size, shape and format of the well patterns
    and to create specific bead pools, or sensors, for different
    applications provides the flexibility to address multiple
    markets and market segments. We believe that these features have
    enabled our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform
    for the emerging high-growth market of SNP genotyping and expect
    they will enable us to become a key player in the gene
    expression market.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines microwells etched
    into a substrate and specially prepared beads that self-assemble
    into an array. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two
    different array formats, the Array Matrix and the BeadChip. Our
    first bead-based product was the Array Matrix which incorporates
    fiber optic bundles. The fiber optic bundles, which we cut into
    lengths of less than one inch, are manufactured to our
    specifications. Each bundle is comprised of approximately 50,000
    individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an
    aluminum plate, which forms an Array Matrix. BeadChips are
    fabricated in microscope slide-shaped sizes with varying numbers
    of sample sites per slide. Both formats are chemically etched to
    create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample
    site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing a specific
    type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in
    a batch. We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a
    given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The
    particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function
    as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by
    attaching a particular DNA sequence, or oligo, to each bead in
    the batch. We combine batches of coated beads to form a pool
    specific to the type of array we intend to create. A bead pool
    one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce
    thousands of arrays.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact
    with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the
    wells, one bead per well. The tens of thousands of beads in the
    wells comprise our individual arrays. Because the beads assemble
    randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called
    ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type
    occupies which well in the array. We employ several proprietary
    methods for decoding, a process that requires only a few steps
    to identify all the beads in the array. One beneficial
    by-product of the decoding process is a validation of each bead
    in the array. This quality control test characterizes the
    performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of
    any empty wells. We ensure that each bead type on the array is
    sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each
    bead type. Multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and
    accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical
    processing of the results of identical beads. We believe we are
    the only microarray company to provide this level of quality
    control in the industry.



An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA
    from a patient, and introducing it to the array. The design
    features of our Array Matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a
    solution containing the sample, whereas our BeadChip allows
    processing of samples on a slide-sized platform. The molecules
    in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated
    bead. These molecules in either the sample or on the bead are
    labeled with a fluorescent dye either before or after the
    binding. The BeadArray Reader detects the fluorescent dye by
    shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the BeadChip.
    This allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a
    quantitative analysis of the sample.

VeraCode
    Technology

The BeadArray technology is most effective in applications which
    require mid- to high levels of multiplexing from low to high
    levels of throughput. Multiplexing refers to the number of
    individual pieces of information that are simultaneously
    extracted from one sample. We believe the molecular diagnostics
    market will require systems which are extremely high throughput
    and cost effective in the mid- to

low-multiplex

range. To address this market, we acquired the VeraCode
    technology through our acquisition of CyVera Corporation in
    April 2005. Based on digitally encoded microbeads, VeraCode
    enables low-cost multiplexing from 1 to 384-plex in a single
    well. We plan to implement the VeraCode technology using our
    newly designed BeadXpress system and our existing assays. We
    believe that this system will enable lower multiplex genotyping,
    gene expression and protein based assays. In the research
    market, we expect our customers to utilize our BeadArray
    technology for their higher multiplex projects and then move to
    our BeadXpress system for their lower multiplex projects
    utilizing the same assays. Additionally, we believe that the
    cost and multiplex advantages of the BeadXpress system using our
    VeraCode technology will be welcomed in the molecular
    diagnostics market. We expect to launch the BeadXpress system
    during the first quarter of 2007, along with several assays for
    the system.

Oligator
    Technology

Genomic applications require many different short pieces of DNA
    that can be made synthetically, called oligos. We have developed
    our proprietary Oligator technology for the parallel synthesis
    of many different oligos to meet the requirements of large-scale
    genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology
    is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly
    higher throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our
    synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many
    robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the
    manufacturing process. In 2005, we implemented our
    fourth-generation Oligator technology, which is capable of
    manufacturing over 13,000 different oligos per run. This is an
    improvement over prior generations of technology where we could
    only manufacture approximately 3,000 oligos per run. This
    increase in scale was necessary to enable us to support the
    manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with Invitrogen as
    well as to support our increased internal need for oligos, a
    critical component of our BeadArray technology, for product
    sales and new product development.



Sequencing
    Technology

Our DNA sequencing technology, acquired as part of the Solexa
    merger which was completed on January 26, 2007, is based on
    use of our

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry. In SBS, single stranded DNA is extended from
    a priming site, one base at a time, using reversible terminator
    nucleotides. These are DNA bases which can be added to a growing
    second strand, but which initially cannot be further extended.
    This means that at each cycle of the chemistry, only one base
    can be added. Each base which is added includes a fluorescent
    label which is specific to the particular base. Thus following
    incorporation, the fluorescence can be imaged, its color
    determined, and the base itself can be inferred. Once this is
    done, an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the
    block that had prevented further extension of the second strand.
    This allows another base to be added, and the cycle can be
    repeated. We have shown data in which this cycle is repeated up
    to 50 times, thus determining DNA sequences which are up to 50
    bases long. This may well increase in the future as we further
    develop this technology. The reversible terminator bases which
    we use are novel synthetic molecules which we manufacture. They
    are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases, so
    we have also developed proprietary enzymes for this purpose.
    Both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant
    intellectual property.

In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on
    microscopic islands of DNA. These are called DNA clusters. Each
    cluster starts as a single DNA molecule, typically a few hundred
    bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow cell. We
    then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create
    copies of each starting molecule. As the copies are made, they
    are covalently linked to the surface, so they cannot diffuse
    away. After a number of cycles of amplification, each cluster
    might have 500 to 1,000 copies of the original starting
    molecule, but still be only about a micron (one-millionth of a
    meter) in diameter. By making so many copies, the fluorescent
    signal from each cluster is significantly increased. Because the
    clusters are so small though, tens of millions of clusters can
    be independently formed inside a single flow cell. This large
    number of clusters can then be sequenced simultaneously, by
    alternate cycles of SBS biochemistry and electronic imaging.

Key Advantages
    of Our Technology

We believe that our technology provides distinct advantages, in
    a variety of applications, over competing technologies, by
    creating cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the
    following characteristics:

High Throughput.

The miniaturization of our
    BeadArray technology provides very high information content per
    unit area. To increase sample throughput, we have formatted our
    array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of
    standard microtiter plates, allowing throughput levels of up to
    nearly 150,000 unique assays per microtiter plate, and we use
    laboratory robotics to speed process time. Similarly, we have
    patterned our whole-genome expression BeadChips to support up to
    48,000 gene expression assays for six samples with each
    BeadChip, and our whole-genome genotyping BeadChips to support
    up to 650,000 genotypes with each BeadChip. Our Infinium and
    GoldenGate assays are supported by full automation and LIMS to
    address high throughput laboratories. Our Illumina Genome
    Analyzer can analyze the DNA sequences of tens of millions of
    clusters at one time.

Cost Effectiveness.

Our array products
    substantially reduce the cost of our customers’ experiments
    as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our
    ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances
    in fiber optics, plasma etching processes, digital imaging and
    bead chemistry. In addition, our products require smaller
    reagent volumes than other array technologies, thereby reducing
    reagent costs for our customers. Our Oligator technology further
    reduces reagent costs, as well as reducing our cost of coating
    beads used in our BeadArray and VeraCode technologies. We expect
    the Illumina Genome Analyzer to allow DNA sequencing at
    1/100th of the cost of conventional capillary instruments.



Flexibility.

We are able to offer flexible
    solutions to our customers based on our ability to attach
    different kinds of molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins and
    other chemicals, to our beads. In addition, we can have
    BeadChips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells
    organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different
    markets and market segments. In combination, the use of beads
    and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for
    our BeadArray technology to be tailored to perform many
    applications in many different market segments, from drug
    discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology allows us to
    manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of
    oligos. DNA sequences determined with our Illumina Genome
    Analyzer can also be used to identify larger DNA or RNA
    molecules from which the sequences have been derived, which
    leads to a series of applications based on tag sequencing,
    including digital gene expression analysis and microRNA
    discovery and quantification.

Quality and Reproducibility.

The quality of
    our products is dependent upon each element in the
    system — the array, the assay used to perform the
    experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture
    the results. Each array is manufactured with a high density of
    beads, which enables us to have multiple copies of each
    individual bead type. We measure the copies simultaneously and
    combine them into one data point. This allows us to make a
    comparison of each bead against its own population of identical
    beads, which permits the statistical calculation of a more
    reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally, the
    manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step
    that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on
    every array, improving the overall quality of the data. When we
    develop the assays used with our products, we focus on
    performance, cost and ease of use. By developing assays that are
    easy to use, we can reduce the potential for the introduction of
    error into the experiment. We believe that this enables
    researchers to obtain high quality and reproducible data from
    their experiments. Additionally, we manufacture substantially
    all of the reagents used in our assays, allowing us to control
    the quality of the product delivered to the customer.

Our
    Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray, BeadXpress and Illumina
    Genome Analyzer platforms the industry standard for products and
    services addressing the genetic analysis markets. We plan to
    achieve this by:

•

focusing on emerging high-growth markets;

•

rapidly commercializing our BeadLab, BeadStation, BeadXpress,
    Illumina Genome Analyzer, Array Matrix and BeadChip products;

•

expanding our technologies into multiple product lines,
    applications and market segments; and

•

strengthening our technological leadership.

Products and
    Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray technology, the Array
    Matrix, is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles
    arranged in a pattern that matches the standard

96-well

microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle performs more than
    1,500 unique assays. The BeadChip, introduced in 2003, is
    fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple
    applications and scanning technologies.

We have provided genotyping services using our proprietary
    BeadArray technology since 2001. In addition, we have developed
    our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this
    technology. These products include disposable Array Matrices and
    BeadChips, GoldenGate and Infinium reagent kits for SNP
    genotyping, BeadArray Reader scanning instruments and an
    evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression
    products.



SNP
    Genotyping

In 2001, we introduced the first commercial application of our
    BeadArray technology by launching our SNP genotyping services
    product line. Since this launch, we have had peak days in which
    we operated at over 60 million genotypes per day. To our
    knowledge, no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable
    levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low
    cost.

We designed our first consumable BeadArray product, the Array
    Matrix, for SNP genotyping. The Array Matrix uses a universal
    format that allows it to analyze any set of SNPs. We have also
    developed reagent kits based on GoldenGate assay protocols and
    the BeadArray Reader, a laser scanner, which is used to read our
    array products.

Depending on throughput and automation requirements, our
    customers can select the system configuration to best meet their
    needs. For production-scale throughput, our BeadLab would be
    appropriate, and for moderate-scale throughput, our BeadStation
    would be selected. Our BeadLab includes our BeadArray Reader,
    combined with LIMS, standard operating procedures and analytical
    software and fluid handling robotics. This production-scale
    system was commercialized in late 2002 and when installed, this
    system can routinely produce millions of genotypes per day.

The BeadStation, a system for performing moderate-scale
    genotyping designed to match the throughput requirements of
    individual research groups and core labs, was commercialized in
    late 2003. The BeadStation includes our BeadArray Reader and
    genotyping

and/or

gene
    expression analysis software. Multiple BeadStations can be
    configured to achieve different levels of desired throughput and
    are fully upgradeable to a full BeadLab through various steps
    that add automation, sample preparation equipment and LIMS
    capability.

In 2003, we announced the availability of an assay set for
    genetic linkage analysis. This standard product has been
    deployed in our genotyping services operation and is also sold
    to customers who use our SNP genotyping systems. Genetic linkage
    analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential
    disease associations across a related set of samples.

In 2005, we announced the introduction of the Major
    Histocompatability Complex (MHC) Panel Set, which allows the
    interrogation of a

difficult-to-assay

area of the genome, often associated with autoimmune diseases.
    In addition, we announced the introduction of Mouse-6 and
    MouseRef-8 Gene Expression BeadChip allowing the study of the
    levels of gene expression in mouse model.

In 2005, we commenced shipping the Sentrix Human-1 Genotyping
    BeadChip for whole-genome genotyping. This BeadChip provides to
    scientists the ability to interrogate over 100,000 SNPs located
    in high-value genetic regions of the human genome. Also, in the
    fourth quarter of 2005, we began shipping the new Sentrix
    HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip to customers around the world.
    Using the Infinium assay, which enables us to select virtually
    any SNP in the genome, the HumanHap300 BeadChip allows analysis
    of more than 317,000 SNPs. We selected the SNPs for inclusion on
    the chip in collaboration with a consortium of scientists that
    are leaders in the genotyping field. We believe this
    product’s quality and performance support our expectation
    that it will become an important discovery tool for researchers
    seeking to understand the genetic basis of common yet complex
    diseases.

In 2006, we introduced several new SNP genotyping products,
    including:

•

Sentrix HumanHap240S BeadChip.

The
    HumanHap240S BeadChip is a companion to our Sentrix HumanHap300
    BeadChip for genome-wide disease association studies that
    enables researchers to interrogate an additional 240,000 SNPs
    utilizing our Infinium assay. We began shipment of this product
    in the first quarter of 2006.

•

Sentrix HumanHap550 BeadChip.

The HumanHap550
    BeadChip contains over 550,000 SNPs on a single microarray. We
    began shipment of this product in the second quarter of 2006.



•

Sentrix HumanHap650Y BeadChip.

The
    HumanHap650Y BeadChip contains over 650,000 SNP markers on a
    single microarray, which we believe provides the most
    comprehensive genomic coverage and highest data quality of any
    whole-genome genotyping product currently available. We began
    shipment of this product in the third quarter of 2006.

•

Sentrix HumanHap550+ BeadChip.

The
    HumanHap550+ BeadChip allows customers to add up to 120,000
    custom SNP markers to supplement the standard content provided
    on the existing Sentrix HumanHap550 BeadChip, yielding up to
    670,000 markers for association studies.

•

iSelect Infinium genotyping products.

The
    iSelect Infinium genotyping product line is used for focused
    content applications. Customers can create a custom array of up
    to 60,000 SNP markers per sample with 12 samples per chip. We
    began shipment of these products in the third quarter of 2006.

•

HumanHap300-Duo and the Human Hap300-Duo+ Genotyping
    BeadChips.

The

HumanHap300-Duo

allows researchers to analyze two samples simultaneously, with
    over 634,000 total tag SNPs on a single BeadChip. The
    HumanHap300-Duo+ allows for the addition of 60,000 custom
    SNP loci to the base product, enabling researchers to enrich
    that product with SNPs of interest in any genomic region. We
    began shipment of the HumanHap300-Duo in the fourth quarter of
    2006.

•

RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip.

The RatRef-12
    Expression BeadChip enables analysis of 12 samples in
    parallel on a single BeadChip. Content for this BeadChip is
    derived from the NCBI RefSeq database (Release 16), with
    over 22,000 rat transcripts represented. We began shipment of
    this product in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Through an application called Copy Number Polymorphisms, the
    HumanHap family of BeadChips also provides high-resolution
    information on amplifications, deletions and loss of
    heterozygosity throughout the genome, abnormalities common in
    cancers and congenital diseases. In addition, we announced
    additional standard panels in the first quarter of 2006,
    including mouse linkage and cancer panels.

Gene
    Expression Profiling

With the addition of application specific accessory kits, our
    production-scale BeadLabs and BeadStations are capable of
    performing a growing number of applications, including gene
    expression profiling.

In 2003, we introduced our focused set gene expression products
    on both the Array Matrix and BeadChip platforms. Our system
    includes a BeadArray Reader for imaging Array Matrices and
    BeadChips, a hybridization chamber and software for data
    extraction. In addition, we have developed standard gene
    expression products for each of the human, mouse and arabidopsis
    genomes with an additional panel that focuses on human
    toxicology.

In 2005, we began shipment of the Human-6 and HumanRef-8
    Expression BeadChip products. Both products allow large-scale
    expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and
    are imaged using our BeadArray Reader. The Human-6 BeadChip is
    designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome samples on
    one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately 48,000
    transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome.
    The HumanRef-8 BeadChip product analyzes eight samples in
    parallel against 24,000 transcripts from the roughly 22,000
    genes represented in the consensus RefSeq database, a
    well-characterized whole-genome subset used broadly in genetic
    analysis. We expect that these gene expression BeadChips will
    dramatically reduce the cost of whole-genome expression
    analysis, allowing researchers to expand the scale and
    reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation. In
    2006, we began shipment of the RatRef-12, which analyzes twelve
    samples in parallel against 22,226 transcripts from the roughly
    21,910 genes represented in the RefSeq database, release 16.



Scanning
    Instrumentation

The BeadArray Reader, an instrument we developed, is a key
    component of both our

production-scale

BeadLab and our benchtop BeadStation. This scanning equipment
    uses a laser to read the results of experiments that are
    captured on our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas
    of genetic analysis that use our Array Matrices and BeadChips.
    In the second quarter of 2006, we began shipment of the
    AutoLoader, which automates BeadChip loading and scanning and
    increases lab throughput. The Autoloader is designed to support
    up to two BeadArray Readers simultaneously for unattended
    operation.

High-Throughput
    Oligo Synthesis

We have put in place a

state-of-the-art

oligo manufacturing facility. This facility serves both the
    commercial needs under our collaboration with Invitrogen and our
    internal needs. In addition to their use to coat beads, these
    oligos are components of the reagent kits for our BeadArray
    products and are used for assay development. We manufacture
    oligos in a wide range of lengths and in several scales, with
    the ability to add many types of modifications. We offer a range
    of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory
    information management system to control much of the
    manufacturing process. In 2005, we stopped selling oligos
    directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our
    collaboration with Invitrogen.

Our Collaborative
    Partners

Invitrogen
    Corporation

In December 2004, we entered into a strategic collaboration with
    Invitrogen. The goal of the collaboration is to combine our
    expertise in oligo manufacturing with the sales, marketing and
    distribution capabilities of Invitrogen. In connection with the
    collaboration, we have developed the next generation Oligator
    DNA synthesis technology. This technology includes both
    plate-and

tube-based

capabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, Invitrogen paid
    us an upfront non-refundable collaboration payment of
    $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. Additionally,
    upon the achievement of a certain milestone, Invitrogen was
    obligated to make a milestone payment of $1.1 million to
    us. During 2005, this milestone was achieved and the milestone
    payment was received. We used these funds to invest in our
    San Diego facility to enable the development and
    implementation of fourth-generation Oligator technology and to
    extend the technology into the larger market for tube-based
    oligo products. We began manufacturing and shipping the
    plate-based and certain tube-based oligo products under the
    collaboration in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, the
    agreement provides for the transfer of our Oligator technology
    into two Invitrogen facilities outside North America.
    Collaboration profit from the sale of collaboration products is
    divided equally between the two companies.



deCODE
    genetics

In May 2006, we executed a Joint Development and Licensing
    Agreement (the Development Agreement) with deCODE genetics, ehf.
    (deCODE). Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the parties
    agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop, validate and
    commercialize specific diagnostic tests for variants in genes
    involved in three disease-related pathways: the gene-encoding
    leukotriene A4 hydrolase, linked to heart attack; the
    gene-encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), linked to
    type 2 diabetes; and the gene-encoding BARD1, linked to breast
    cancer. With deCODE, we are developing diagnostic tests based on
    these variants for use on our BeadXpress system. Under the
    agreement, we will be responsible for the manufacturing,
    marketing and selling of the diagnostic products. The companies
    will share the development costs of these products and split the
    profits from sales of the diagnostics tests. The Development
    Agreement may be terminated as to a particular product under
    development if one party decides to discontinue funding the
    development of that product, and may be terminated in whole by
    either party if the other party commits an uncured material
    breach, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent. Under a
    separate supply agreement, we installed instrumentation at
    deCODE that will enable deCODE to perform whole genome
    association studies on up to 100,000 samples using the our
    Sentrix HumanHap300 BeadChips and associated reagents.

Intellectual
    Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including, as of
    February 1, 2007, ownership of, or exclusive licenses to,
    106 issued U.S. patents and 149 pending U.S. patent
    applications, including five allowed applications that have not
    yet issued as patents, some of which derive from a common parent
    application. This portfolio includes patents acquired as part of
    the Solexa merger on January 26, 2007. Our issued patents,
    which are directed at various aspects of our array, assay, oligo
    synthesis, instrument and chemical detection technologies,
    expire between 2011 and 2024. We are seeking to extend the
    patents directed at the full range of our technologies. We have
    received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and
    applications in one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright and
    trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
    innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
    our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
    ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
    processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets, to
    operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third
    parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology
    or products.

We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
    agreements with third parties, which grant us rights to use key
    aspects of our array and sequencing technologies, assay methods,
    chemical detection methods, reagent kits and scanning equipment.
    We have exclusive licenses from Tufts University to patents that
    are directed at our use of BeadArray technology. These patents
    were filed by Dr. David Walt, a member of our board of
    directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and one
    of our founders. Our exclusive licenses expire with the
    termination of the underlying patents, which will occur between
    2010 and 2020. We also have additional nonexclusive licenses
    from various third parties for other components of our products.
    In all cases, the agreements remain in effect over the term of
    the underlying patents, may be terminated at our request without
    further obligation and require that we pay customary royalties
    while the agreement is in effect.

Research and
    Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
    since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
    engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
    chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
    software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
    complete the development of our products. Our research and
    development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
    to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies and to
    support commercialization of the products and services derived
    from these technologies. As of December 31, 2006, we had a
    total of 144 employees engaged in research and development
    activities.



Our research and development expenses for 2006, 2005 and 2004
    (inclusive of charges relating to stock-based compensation of
    $3.9 million, $0.1 million, and $0.3 million,
    respectively) were $33.4 million, $27.8 million and
    $21.5 million, respectively. Compared to 2006, we expect
    research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars
    and as a percentage of overall revenue during 2007 as we
    continue to expand our research and product development efforts,
    including research and development projects associated with our
    acquisition of Solexa.

Marketing and
    Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
    life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving
    sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. These
    experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research,
    including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug
    discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and
    agricultural research. Our potential customers include
    pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and
    consumer products companies, as well as academic or private
    research centers. The genetic analysis market is relatively new
    and emerging and its size and speed of development will be
    ultimately driven by, among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and biological
    function; and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
    North America, major European markets, Japan and Singapore. In
    each of these areas, we have dedicated sales, service and
    application support personnel responsible for expanding and
    managing their respective customer bases. In smaller markets in
    the Pacific Rim countries and Europe, we sell our products and
    provide services to customers through distributors that
    specialize in life science products. We expect to significantly
    increase our sales and distribution resources during 2007 and
    beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the
    number of customers that can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our array platforms, reagent kits, scanning
    equipment and oligos in-house. Our manufacturing capacity for
    BeadChips has increased approximately fourfold over the level as
    of January 1, 2006. We intend to continue to increase
    capacity as needed to manufacture our products in sufficient
    quantity to meet our business plan for 2007. We are focused on
    continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our
    Array Matrices and BeadChips and are exploring ways to continue
    increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process.
    In addition, we have implemented information management systems
    for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage
    all aspects of material and sample use. We adhere to access and
    safety standards required by federal, state and local health
    ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal
    of hazardous substances.

We intend to add capacity to manufacture Array Matrices and
    BeadChips throughout 2007. We currently depend upon outside
    suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products.
    We intend to continue, and may extend, the outsourcing of
    portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we
    determine it is in our best commercial interests.



Competition

Although we expect that our BeadArray products and services will
    provide significant advantages over currently available products
    and services, we expect to encounter intense competition from
    other companies that offer products and services for the SNP
    genotyping, gene expression and sequencing markets. These
    include companies such as Affymetrix, Agilent, Amersham
    Biosciences (acquired by GE Corp. and now named GE
    Healthcare), Applera Corporation, Applied Biosystems, Beckman
    Coulter, Caliper Technologies, Luminex, Monogram Biosciences,
    NimbleGen, Perlegen Sciences, Roche Diagnostics in partnership
    with 454 Life Sciences, Sequenom and Third Wave Technologies.
    Some of these companies have or will have substantially greater
    financial, technical, research, and other resources and larger,
    more established marketing, sales, distribution and service
    organizations than we do. In addition, they may have greater
    name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address
    and in some cases a large installed base of systems. Each of
    these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors
    to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the
    future. In order to effectively compete with these companies, we
    will need to demonstrate that our products have superior
    throughput, cost and accuracy advantages over the existing
    products. Rapid technological development may result in our
    products or technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by
    us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more
    effective products based on similar or other technologies.
    Although we believe that our technology and products will offer
    advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these
    companies, we cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Segment and
    Geographic Information

We operate in one business segment, for the development,
    manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis.
    Our operations are treated as one segment as we only report
    operating results on an aggregate basis to our chief operating
    decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer.

During 2006, $81.5 million, or 44%, of our total revenue
    came from shipments to customers outside the United States,
    compared to $28.0 million, or 38%, in 2005. Sales to
    territories outside of the United States are generally
    denominated in U.S. dollars. We expect that sales to
    international customers will continue to be an important and
    growing source of revenue. We have sales support resources in
    Western Europe and direct sales offices in Japan, Singapore and
    China. In addition, we have distributor relationships in various
    countries in the Pacific Rim region and Europe.

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
    significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
    is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
    highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic
    customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the
    government’s fiscal year.

Environmental
    Matters

We are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the
    environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
    materials which subject us to a variety of federal, state and
    local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
    we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and
    regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and
    fines should contamination of the environment or individual
    exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot
    predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the
    development of new laws and regulations, will affect our
    business operations or the cost of compliance.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had a total of 596 employees,
    73 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees. 43 of our employees with Ph.D.
    degrees are engaged in full-time research and development
    activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor
    union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
    described below. In addition to the other information included
    in this

Form 10-K,

the following issues could adversely affect our operating
    results or our stock price.

Litigation or
    other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property
    infringement could require us to spend significant time and
    money and could prevent us from selling our products or services
    or impact our stock price.

Our commercial success depends in part on our non-infringement
    of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our
    ability to protect our own intellectual property. As we have
    previously disclosed, Affymetrix, Inc. filed a complaint against
    us in July 2004, alleging infringement of six of its patents.

On June 30, 2006, the court dismissed a patent Affymetrix
    had sought to withdraw from its suit leaving five patents being
    asserted against us. On August 16, 2006, the court issued a
    ruling on the claim construction hearing that it had held on
    April 20, 2006 as part of this litigation. We believe the
    court’s mixed ruling interpreted certain claim terms in our
    favor, and did not adversely impact our defenses and
    counterclaims which are still pending. At the request of both
    parties, trial has been rescheduled to March 5, 2007 from
    October 16, 2006. A pre-trial conference was held on
    February 8, 2007 during which the court established a
    multi-phase trial structure with the first phase of the trial to
    begin on March 5, 2007, and addressed related issues. Any
    adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling throughout
    these proceedings may have an adverse impact on our stock price,
    and such impact may be disproportionate to the actual import of
    the ruling itself.



Third parties, including Affymetrix, have asserted or may assert
    that we are employing their proprietary technology without
    authorization. As we enter new markets, we expect that
    competitors will likely assert that our products infringe their
    intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to
    impede our successful entry into those markets. In addition,
    third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain
    patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies
    infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and
    divert the attention of our management and technical personnel
    in defending ourselves against any of these claims. Furthermore,
    parties making claims against us may be able to obtain
    injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our
    ability to develop further, commercialize and sell products, and
    could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In
    the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we
    may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses
    from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain
    products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a
    reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial
    costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from
    third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions
    while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.
    Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these
    licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from
    commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of
    our products could materially affect our ability to grow and
    maintain profitability.

We expect
    intense competition in our target markets, which could render
    our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This
    would limit our ability to compete and maintain profitability.
    If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new
    products, our revenue may not grow as intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture
    and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function and other applications using technologies
    such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary
    electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
    microfluidics, nanotechnology, next-generation DNA sequencing
    and mechanically deposited, inkjet and photolithographic arrays.
    We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the
    future as existing companies develop new or improved products
    and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. The
    markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing
    technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
    needs, emerging competition, new product introductions and
    strong price competition. For example, prices per data point for
    genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and
    we anticipate that prices will continue to fall. One or more of
    our competitors may render our technology obsolete or
    uneconomical. Some of our competitors have greater financial and
    personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established
    customer base and more experience in research and development
    than we do. Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical
    companies, which are our potential customers and strategic
    partners, could develop competing products. If we are unable to
    develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new
    product offerings, our business, financial condition and results
    of operations will suffer.

Any inability
    to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm
    our competitive position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents
    and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in
    the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
    intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
    our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
    The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
    rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
    many companies have encountered significant challenges in
    protecting their proprietary rights abroad. These challenges can
    be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the
    establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights
    abroad.



The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent
    position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and
    factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary
    rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent
    that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and
    enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade
    secrets. We intend to apply for patents covering our
    technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However, our
    patent applications may be challenged and may not result in
    issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after
    they are issued. Questions as to inventorship may also arise.
    For example, in June 2005, a former employee filed a complaint
    against us, claiming he is entitled to be named as joint
    inventor of certain of our U.S. patents and pending
    U.S. and foreign patent applications, and seeking a
    judgment that the related patents and applications are
    unenforceable. Any finding that our patents and applications are
    unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from
    practicing the related technology, and a finding that others
    have inventorship rights to our patents and applications could
    require us to obtain certain rights to practice related
    technologies, which may not be available on favorable terms, if
    at all.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we
    obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
    practicing our technologies or from developing competing
    products. There also is risk that others may independently
    develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
    patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us
    with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate
    additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or
    litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive
    and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual
    property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the
    marketplace. Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the
    attention of our management and technical personnel.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential
    and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to
    protect our confidential information. These measures, however,
    may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or
    other confidential information. Among other things, we seek to
    protect our trade secrets and confidential information by
    entering into confidentiality agreements with employees,
    collaborators and consultants. Nevertheless, employees,
    collaborators or consultants may still disclose our confidential
    information, and we may not otherwise be able to effectively
    protect our trade secrets. Accordingly, others may gain access
    to our confidential information, or may independently develop
    substantially equivalent information or techniques.

If we are
    unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing
    capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products
    in a timely manner, or at all.

We currently possess limited facilities capable of manufacturing
    our principle products and services for both sale to our
    customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to
    significantly damage our facility or if other events were to
    cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from
    developing and manufacturing our products and services. Also,
    many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are
    controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS). Additionally, as part of the decoding
    step in our array manufacturing process, we record several
    images of each array to identify what bead is in each location
    on the array and to validate each bead in the array. This
    requires significant network and storage infrastructure. If
    either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure
    were to fail for an extended period of time, it would adversely
    impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis
    and may prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any
    given period.



Our
    manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our
    products.

We continue to ramp up our capacity to meet our anticipated
    demand for our products. Although we have significantly
    increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe that we have
    sufficient plans in place to ensure we have adequate capacity to
    meet our business plan in 2007 and 2008, there are uncertainties
    inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may
    not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For
    example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as
    we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and
    launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties
    in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand, in which
    case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product
    introductions, and demand for our products could decline.
    Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in
    manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced
    production yields. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing
    products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or
    previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that
    could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability
    to launch or sell these products, or to produce them
    economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance
    levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by
    customers.

If we are
    unable to find third-party manufacturers to manufacture
    components of our products, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

The nature of our products requires customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. For
    example, we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and
    BeadChip slides included in our products from single vendors. If
    we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other
    product components, we will be unable to meet demand for our
    products. We may need to enter into contractual relationships
    with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of
    our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and we
    cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely
    basis, for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable
    terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain
    reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable
    costs.

We may
    encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could
    adversely affect our business.

We acquired Solexa in January 2007 and CyVera Corporation in
    April 2005 and we may in the future acquire technology, products
    or businesses related to our current or future business. We have
    limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to
    devote substantial time and resources in order to complete
    acquisitions. Further, these potential acquisitions entail
    risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business.
    For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate a
    company’s operations, technologies, products and services,
    information systems and personnel into our business. An
    acquisition may further strain our existing financial and
    managerial resources, and divert management’s attention
    away from our other business concerns. In connection with these
    acquisitions, we assumed certain liabilities and hired certain
    employees, which is expected to continue to result in an
    increase in our research and development expenses and capital
    expenditures. There may also be unanticipated costs and
    liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely
    affect our operating results. To finance any acquisitions, we
    may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration,
    which would result in dilution to our stockholders.
    Additionally, an acquisition may have a substantial negative
    impact on near-term expected financial results.

The success of the Solexa merger will depend, in part, on our
    ability to realize the anticipated synergies, growth
    opportunities and cost savings from integrating Solexa’s
    businesses with our businesses. Our success in realizing these
    benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the
    successful integration of the operations of Solexa. The
    integration of two independent companies is a complex, costly
    and time-consuming process. The difficulties of combining the
    operations of the companies include, among other factors:

•

lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of
    either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the
    combined company;



•

complexities associated with managing the combined businesses;

•

integrating personnel from diverse corporate cultures while
    maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products
    and customer service;

•

coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and
    facilities;

•

potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses
    or delays associated with the merger; and

•

performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a
    result of the diversion of management’s attention to the
    merger.

If we are unable to successfully combine the businesses in a
    manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost
    savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the
    merger, such anticipated benefits of the merger may not be
    realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
    expected. In addition, we and Solexa have operated and will
    continue to operate independently. It is possible that the
    integration process could result in the loss of key employees,
    diversion of each company’s management’s attention,
    the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in,
    each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in
    standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could
    adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with
    customers and employees or our ability to achieve the
    anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings
    or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results
    of the combined company.

The combined
    company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the
    merger as a result of our failure to achieve anticipated revenue
    growth following the merger.

Solexa’s business faces significant risks. These risks
    include the fact that Solexa’s technology is at the
    development stage and, although Solexa has accepted orders for
    its Genome Analyzer and has shipped and installed those systems,
    Solexa has not completed performance specifications for those
    systems and has not invoiced customers for them. There can be no
    assurance it will be able to do so. These risks also include
    those described under the caption “Risk Factors” of
    Solexa’s Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the
    quarterly period ended September 30, 2006, and may include
    additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we
    currently do not believe are material. If any of the events or
    circumstances underlying these risks actually occur,
    Solexa’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations could be harmed and, as a result, Solexa may, among
    other things, fail to achieve the anticipated revenue growth
    following the merger.

The merger
    will cause dilution of Illumina’s earnings per
    share.

The merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger
    agreement are expected to have a dilutive effect on our earnings
    per share at least through 2007 due to losses of Solexa, the
    additional shares of Illumina common stock that were issued in
    the merger, the transaction and integration-related costs and
    other factors such as the potential failure to realize any
    benefit from synergies anticipated in the merger. These factors
    could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.



Solexa had a
    material weakness in its internal controls over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005. If additional material
    weaknesses are identified in the future, current and potential
    stockholders could lose confidence in our consolidated financial
    reporting, which could harm our business and the trading of our
    common stock.

As of December 31, 2005, Solexa did not maintain effective
    control over the application of GAAP related to the financial
    reporting process. This control deficiency resulted in numerous
    adjustments being required to bring Solexa’s financial
    statements into compliance with GAAP. Additionally, this
    deficiency could have resulted in material misstatement of the
    annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would
    not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, Solexa’s
    management determined that this control deficiency constituted a
    material weakness. Because of this material weakness,
    Solexa’s management concluded that, as of December 31,
    2005, it did not maintain effective internal control over
    financial reporting based on those criteria. Should we, or our
    independent registered public accounting firm, determine in
    future fiscal periods that there are material weaknesses in our
    consolidated internal controls over financial reporting
    (including Solexa), the reliability of our financial reports may
    be impacted, and our results of operations or financial
    condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may
    decline.

We expect that
    our results of operations will fluctuate. This fluctuation could
    cause our stock price to decline.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and services projects, the impact
    of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the
    difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for
    our products and services, we may experience

quarter-to-quarter

fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a
    sequential decline in quarterly revenue. A large portion of our
    expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for
    facilities, equipment and personnel. In addition, we expect
    operating expenses to continue to increase significantly.
    Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not
    be able to maintain annual profitability. Any significant delays
    in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales
    trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other
    factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future
    revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly
    revenue. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue
    and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our
    operating results are not a good indication of our future
    performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet
    the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our
    stock price could decline.

We have a
    limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable
    products, and our success depends on our ability to develop
    commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our
    new and relatively unproven technologies.

We may not possess all of the resources, capability and
    intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all
    the products or services that may result from our technologies.
    Sales of our genotyping and gene expression systems only began
    in 2003, and some of our other technologies are in the early
    stages of commercialization or are still in development. You
    should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and
    complexities affecting similarly situated companies developing
    tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. We
    must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and
    development before some of our products will be ready for sale,
    and we currently have fewer resources available for research and
    development activities than some of our competitors. We may not
    be able to develop or launch new products in a timely manner, or
    at all, or they may not meet customer requirements or be of
    sufficient quality or at a price that enables us to compete
    effectively in the marketplace. Problems frequently encountered
    in connection with the development or early commercialization of
    products and services using new and relatively unproven
    technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully
    commercialize these products and services. In addition, we may
    need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property
    necessary to commercialize some of our products or services,
    which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.



Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have
    analyzed genetic variation and biological function using a
    variety of technologies. In order to be successful, our products
    must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and
    pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large-scale analysis
    of genetic variation and biological function.

Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:

•

our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits
    and cost effectiveness of our products and services relative to
    others available in the market;

•

the extent and effectiveness of our efforts to market, sell and
    distribute our products;

•

our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities
    with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable
    cost;

•

the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new
    technologies requiring capital investments; and

•

the extended time lag and sales expenses involved between the
    time a potential customer is contacted on a possible sale of our
    products and services and the time the sale is consummated or
    rejected by the customer.

Our sales,
    marketing and technical support organization may limit our
    ability to sell our products.

We currently have fewer resources available for sales and
    marketing and technical support services compared to some of our
    primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our
    sequencing, genotyping and gene expression systems and other
    products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing
    and technical support staff both domestically and
    internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or
    maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution
    arrangements to market our products and services. In addition,
    we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger
    sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base
    of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales and
    marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market
    acceptance of our products required to support continued growth
    of our business.

We have only
    recently achieved annual operating profitability.

Prior to 2006, we had incurred net losses each year since our
    inception. As of December 31, 2006, our accumulated deficit
    was $104.6 million. Our ability to sustain annual
    profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if
    any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses.
    SFAS No. 123R is also likely to adversely affect our
    future profitability. We expect to continue incurring
    significant expenses related to research and development, sales
    and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the
    continued development of our manufacturing capabilities. In
    addition, we expect that our research and development and
    selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in
    the future as a result of the development and launch of new
    products. Even if we maintain profitability, we may not be able
    to increase profitability on a quarterly basis.

We may
    encounter difficulties in managing our growth. These
    difficulties could impair our profitability.

We have experienced, and we may expect to continue to experience
    rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating
    plans, which will place a strain on our human and capital
    resources. If we are unable to manage this growth effectively,
    our profitability could suffer. Our ability to manage our
    operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to
    expend funds to enhance our operational, financial and
    management controls, reporting systems and procedures and to
    attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees. If
    we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our
    manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or
    timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing
    systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available
    the products required to successfully commercialize our
    technology. Failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of
    talented employees will further strain our human resources and
    could impede our growth.



Our effective
    tax rate may vary significantly.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by
    various internal and external factors. These factors, include
    but are not limited to, earnings being lower than anticipated in
    countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
    anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates;
    changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities; or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof;
    changes in tax rates, future levels of research and development
    spending, and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings. Any
    new interpretative guidance relating to accounting for uncertain
    tax positions could adversely affect our tax provision.

If we lose our
    key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional
    personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
    personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief
    executive officer, John Stuelpnagel, our senior vice president
    and chief operating officer and John West, our senior vice
    president and general manager of DNA sequencing . The loss of
    their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our
    business objectives. We will need to hire additional qualified
    personnel with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry,
    biological information processing, sales, marketing and
    technical support. We compete for qualified management and
    scientific personnel with other life science companies,
    universities and research institutions, particularly those
    focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals,
    particularly in the San Diego area, is intense, and the
    turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain
    management and scientific personnel would prevent us from
    pursuing collaborations or developing our products or
    technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional expertise in
    specific industries and areas applicable to the products
    developed through our technologies, including the life sciences
    and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add new
    personnel, including management, and develop the expertise of
    existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
    growth of our business.

A significant
    portion of our sales are to international
    customers.

Approximately 44% and 38% of our revenue for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively,
    was derived from shipments to customers outside the United
    States. We intend to continue to expand our international
    presence and export sales to international customers and we
    expect the total amount of

non-U.S. sales

to continue to grow. Export sales entail a variety of risks,
    including:

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of
    foreign countries into which we import our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other
    trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety
    of foreign laws.

In addition, sales to international customers typically result
    in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts
    receivable collection. We are also subject to general
    geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic
    instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. One
    or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and operating results.



Our success
    depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for
    analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our
    technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data
    and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are
    initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation
    and biological function, namely SNP genotyping and gene
    expression profiling. Both of these markets are new and
    emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate,
    or reach their full potential. Other methods of analysis of
    genetic variation and biological function may emerge and
    displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may
    not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically
    valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation
    and biological function. In addition, factors affecting research
    and development spending generally, such as changes in the
    regulatory environment affecting life sciences and
    pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs
    that provide funding to companies and research institutions,
    could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available
    or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner,
    demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we
    expect, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain annual
    profitability.

As part of our acquisition of Solexa on January 26, 2007,
    we assumed a non-cancelable operating lease for facilities space
    of approximately 147,000 square feet in two buildings in
    Hayward, California. One of the buildings is utilized for
    administrative operations, research and development, genomics
    services production and instrument production. The remaining
    space may be developed and occupied in phases, depending on
    growth. The Hayward lease runs through December 2008. We have an
    option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period,
    subject to certain conditions. We also lease approximately
    23,000 square feet in Little Chesterford, United Kingdom,
    which is occupied by Solexa Limited, our wholly-owned
    subsidiary. The Chesterford lease expires in July 2008.



On February 14, 2007, we entered into a lease agreement
    with BioMed Realty Trust, Inc. (BioMed) to expand into a new
    office building BioMed will build in San Diego, California.
    The new building will be used for research and development,
    manufacturing and administrative purposes. The lease covers
    approximately 84,000 square feet, which is to be occupied
    in three phases, the first of which is expected to be occupied
    by October 1, 2008. The lease expires 15 years from
    the date the first phase is occupied, subject to our right to
    extend the term for up to three additional five-year periods.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

We have incurred substantial costs in defending ourselves
    against patent infringement claims, and expect to devote
    substantial financial and managerial resources to protect our
    intellectual property and to defend against the claims described
    below as well as any future claims asserted against us.

Affymetrix
    Litigation

On July 26, 2004, Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix) filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Delaware alleging that the use, manufacture and sale of our
    BeadArray products and services, including our Array Matrix and
    BeadChip products, infringe six Affymetrix patents. Affymetrix
    seeks an injunction against the sale of products, if any, that
    are determined to infringe these patents, unspecified monetary
    damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. On
    September 15, 2004, we filed our answer to Affymetrix’
    complaint, seeking declaratory judgments from the court that we
    do not infringe the Affymetrix patents and that such patents are
    invalid. We also filed counterclaims against Affymetrix for
    unfair competition and interference with actual and prospective
    economic advantage.

On February 15, 2006, the court allowed us to file our
    first amended answer and counterclaims, adding allegations of
    inequitable conduct with respect to all six asserted Affymetrix
    patents, violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, and
    unclean hands. In March 2006, Affymetrix notified us of its
    decision to drop one of the six patents from the suit and of its
    intention to assert infringement of certain additional claims of
    the remaining five patents. We have filed a motion to preclude
    Affymetrix from asserting infringement of those additional
    claims. That motion is still pending at this time. On
    June 30, 2006, the court dismissed the patent Affymetrix
    had sought to withdraw from the suit. Both parties filed summary
    judgment motions by the July 14, 2006 deadline established
    by the court. On August 16, 2006, the court issued a ruling
    on the claim construction hearing that it had held on
    April 20, 2006. We believe the court’s opinion
    construed several key claim terms in our favor, and did not
    adversely impact our defenses and pending counterclaims in any
    material respect. Trial has been rescheduled to March 5,
    2007 from October 16, 2006 at the request of both parties.
    A pre-trial conference was held on February 8, 2007 during
    which the court established a multi-phase trial structure with
    the first phase of the trial to begin on March 5, 2007, and
    addressed related issues. We believe we have meritorious
    defenses against each of the infringement claims alleged by
    Affymetrix, and intend to defend vigorously against this suit.
    However, we cannot be sure that we will prevail in this matter.
    Any unfavorable determination, and in particular, any
    significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or
    prohibition of the sale of our products and services, could
    result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.



Dr. Anthony
    W. Czarnik v. Illumina, Inc.

On June 15, 2005, Dr. Anthony Czarnik, a former
    employee, filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court
    for the District of Delaware seeking correction of inventorship
    of certain of our patents and patent applications and alleging
    that we committed inequitable conduct and fraud in not naming
    him as an inventor. Dr. Czarnik seeks an order requiring us
    and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to correct the
    inventorship of certain of our patents and patent applications
    by adding Dr. Czarnik as an inventor, a judgment declaring
    certain of our patents and patent applications unenforceable,
    unspecified monetary damages and attorney’s fees. On
    August 4, 2005, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint
    for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. While this
    motion was pending, Dr. Czarnik filed an amended complaint
    on September 23, 2005. On October 7, 2005, we filed a
    motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of standing and
    failure to state a claim. On July 13, 2006, the court
    granted our motion to dismiss the counts of
    Dr. Czarnik’s complaint dealing with correction of
    inventorship in pending applications and inequitable conduct. On
    July 27, 2006, we filed an answer to the two remaining
    counts of the amended complaint (correction of inventorship in
    issued patents and fraud). There has been no trial date set for
    this case. We believe we have meritorious defenses against these
    claims.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of
    Applera Corporation filed suit against Solexa, which we acquired
    in a

stock-for-stock

merger on January 26, 2007. Applied Biosystems’ action
    against Solexa, which was filed in California state court in
    Santa Clara County, seeks ownership of patents covering

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies. We filed our answer to the complaint by the
    required deadline. The patents at issue were assigned in 1995 to
    Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx Therapeutics) by a
    former employee, Dr. Stephen Macevicz, who is named as a
    co-defendant in the suit. Lynx, which was originally a unit of
    Applied Biosystems, was spun out of Applied Biosystems in 1992.
    The patents at issue in the suit relate to methods for
    sequencing DNA using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe
    ligation

(Sequencing-by-Ligation).

Our new Illumina Genome Analyzer system uses a different
    technology, DNA

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which we believe is not covered by any of the patents at
    issue in the suit. We also believe the MPSS technology used by
    Lynx did not use the methods covered by these patents, and in
    any event our subsidiary no longer uses the MPSS technologies.
    We believe that the suit is not material to our current or
    future business, and we have no plans to use any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by the patents at issue in the suit.
    Applied Biosystems does not assert any claim for patent
    infringement in the suit.

Termination-of-Employment

Lawsuit

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an unspecified
    amount was filed against us by Dr. Czarnik in the Superior
    Court of the State of California in connection with the
    employee’s termination of employment with Illumina. In June
    2002, a California Superior Court judgment was rendered against
    us and we recorded a $7.7 million charge in our financial
    results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover total damages
    and remaining expenses. We appealed the decision, and in
    December 2004, the Fourth Appellate District Court of Appeal, in
    San Diego, California, reduced the amount of the award. We
    recorded interest expense on the $7.7 million during the
    appeal based on the statutory rate. As a result of the revised
    judgment, we reduced the $9.2 million liability on our
    balance sheet to $5.9 million and recorded a gain of
    $3.3 million as a litigation judgment in the fourth quarter
    of 2004. In January 2005, we paid the $5.9 million and
    removed the liability from our balance sheet.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for
    Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock has been quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market
    under the symbol “ILMN” since July 28, 2000.
    Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common
    stock. The following table sets forth, for the periods
    indicated, the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of
    our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market. Our
    present policy is to retain earnings, if any, to finance future
    growth. We have never paid cash dividends and have no present
    intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In
    addition, the indenture for our convertible senior notes due
    2014, which are convertible into cash and, in certain
    circumstances, shares of our common stock, requires us to
    increase the conversion rate applicable to the notes if we pay
    any cash dividends.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation.

The following discussion and analysis should be read with
    “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and our
    consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives,
    expectations and intentions. Words such as
    “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “predict,” “project”
    or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words,
    may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of
    these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not
    forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include,
    among others, statements regarding the integration of
    Solexa’s and CyVera’s technology with our existing
    technology, the commercial launch of new products, including
    products based on Solexa’s and CyVera’s technology,
    and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is
    expected to fund our operating activities.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown
    risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate
    assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those expected or implied by the forward looking
    statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these
    differences include those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere. The risk
    factors and other cautionary statements made in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

should be read as applying to all related forward-looking
    statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

    throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
    perform the billions of genetic tests needed to extract valuable
    medical information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We
    believe this information will enable researchers to correlate
    genetic variation and biological function, which will enhance
    drug discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be
    detected earlier and permit better choices of drugs for
    individual patients.



On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Solexa
    for approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock.
    Solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies
    used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome
    resequencing, gene expressing analysis and small RNA analysis.
    We believe our combined company is the only company with
    genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene expression and
    sequencing, the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of
    seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns. Any
    significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay
    of commercial acceptance of new products, unfavorable sales
    trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other
    factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue
    growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. Due
    to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income
    or loss, we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating
    results are not a good indication of our future performance.

Prior to 2006, we incurred substantial operating losses. As of
    December 31, 2006, our accumulated deficit was
    $104.6 million and total stockholders’ equity was
    $247.3 million. Losses prior to 2006 have principally
    occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for
    the research, development and manufacturing

scale-up

effort required to commercialize our products and services, an
    acquired

in-process

research and development charge of $15.8 million related to
    our acquisition of CyVera in 2005 and a charge of
    $5.9 million in 2004 related to a

termination-of-employment

lawsuit. We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for
    research, development and manufacturing

scale-up

activities over the next several years. We will also need to
    increase our selling, general and administrative costs as we
    build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and
    support the sale of systems, other products and services.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to the
    application of accounting policies that affect the reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
    to our consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting
    policies are deemed critical if 1) they require an
    accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were
    highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and
    2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur, or different estimates that we reasonably could have used
    would have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Management has discussed the development and selection of these
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our
    Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our
    financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed
    critical as defined above.

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect
    our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the
    preparation of the consolidated financial statements.



Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and
    services. Product revenue consists of sales of arrays, reagents,
    instrumentation and oligos. Service and other revenue consists
    of revenue received for performing genotyping services, extended
    warranty sales and revenue earned from milestone payments.

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
    the seller’s price to the customer is fixed or determinable
    and collectibility is reasonably assured. In instances where
    final acceptance of the product or system is required, revenue
    is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met. All
    revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns
    or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    However, in the case of BeadLabs, revenue is recognized upon the
    completion of installation, training and customer acceptance.
    Revenue for genotyping services is recognized when earned, which
    is generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is
    delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are achieved.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based
    on future performance or a right of return exists, we defer
    revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and
    determinable. We assess collectibility based on a number of
    factors, including past transaction history with the customer
    and the creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. We also sell separately priced maintenance (extended
    warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or two years,
    upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for
    extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
    the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an increase in
    warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products
    were greater than our estimates, gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

While the majority of our sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, we do enter into agreements that contain
    multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to
    determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
    deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should
    be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be
    allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize
    revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue
    should be recognized. We recognize revenue for delivered
    elements only when we determine that the fair values of
    undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties
    regarding customer acceptance.



Some of our agreements contain multiple elements that include
    milestone payments. Revenue from a milestone achievement is
    recognized when earned, as evidenced by acknowledgement from our
    collaborator, provided that (i) the milestone event is
    substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at
    the inception of the agreement, (ii) the milestone
    represents the culmination of an earnings process,
    (iii) the milestone payment is non-refundable and
    (iv) the performance obligations for both us and our
    collaborators after the milestone achievement will continue at a
    level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement.
    If all of these criteria are not met, the milestone achievement
    is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our
    performance obligations under the agreement. We defer
    non-refundable upfront fees received under our collaborations
    and recognize them over the period the related services are
    provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various
    factors specific to the collaboration. Advance payments received
    in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue
    until earned.

Research revenue consists of amounts earned under research
    agreements with government grants, which is recognized in the
    period during which the related costs are incurred.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
    required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
    regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
    receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates. If
    the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    additional allowances could be required.

Inventory
    Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
    obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
    realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
    market conditions and the release of new products that will
    supercede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
    obsolete products and components, taking into account product
    life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality
    issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels.
    If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated,
    additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
    intellectual property matters. Based on the information
    available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation
    with our legal counsel, we assess the likelihood of any adverse
    judgments or outcomes of these matters, as well as the potential
    ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably
    estimable, we will record a liability in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

Currently, we have no such
    liabilities recorded. This may change in the future depending
    upon new developments.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence.



Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
    Share-Based Payment, we recognize excess tax benefits associated
    with share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only
    when realized. When assessing whether excess tax benefits
    relating to share-based compensation have been realized, we
    follow the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us.

Goodwill and
    Intangible Asset Valuation

The purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires
    extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate
    the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and
    development (IPR&D). Goodwill and intangible assets deemed
    to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to
    at least annual impairment tests. The amounts and useful lives
    assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future
    amortization, and the amount assigned to IPR&D is expensed
    immediately. Determining the fair values and useful lives of
    intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment.
    While there are a number of different acceptable generally
    accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible
    assets acquired, we primarily use the discounted cash flow
    method. This method requires significant management judgment to
    forecast the future operating results used in the analysis. In
    addition, other significant estimates are required such as
    residual growth rates and discount factors. The estimates we use
    to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the
    plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are
    based on available historical information and industry estimates
    and averages. These judgments can significantly affect our net
    operating results.

SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and
    certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair
    value measurement techniques. If the carrying amount of a
    reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a goodwill
    impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the
    impairment loss, if any. The goodwill impairment test compares
    the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair
    value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a
    business combination. Determining the fair value of the implied
    goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of
    significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
    assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
    impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any
    such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined
    using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These
    approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including
    projection and timing of future cash flows, discount rates
    reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual
    growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables,
    and determination of whether a premium or discount should be
    applied to comparables. It is reasonably possible that the plans
    and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect. If
    our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future
    impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used
    to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur
    additional impairment charges. As of December 31, 2006, we
    had $2.1 million of goodwill. This goodwill is reported as
    a separate line item in the balance sheet. We have performed our
    annual test of goodwill as of May 1, 2006 and have
    determined there has been no impairment of goodwill as of
    December 31, 2006.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation
    cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s
    fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)

option-pricing

model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service
    period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental
    assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected
    option life. If any of these assumptions used in the BSM model
    change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may
    differ materially in the future from that recorded in the
    current period.

Total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006 was $184.6 million and
    $73.5 million, respectively. This represents an increase of
    $111.1 million for 2006, or 151%, compared to 2005.



Product revenue increased to $155.8 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $57.8 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2006. The increase in 2006 resulted
    primarily from higher consumable and BeadStation sales. Growth
    in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch
    and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products, the
    HumanHap300 and HumanHap550 BeadChips. In addition, growth in
    consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our
    installed base of BeadArray Readers, which has nearly doubled
    since January 1, 2006. Consumable products constituted 66%
    of product revenue for year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 47% in the year ended January 1, 2006. We
    expect to see continued growth in product revenue, which can be
    partially attributed to the launch of several new products, as
    well as the growth of our installed base of instruments.

Service and other revenue increased to $27.5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 from $13.9 million
    for the year ended January 1, 2006. The increase in service
    and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several
    significant Infinium and GoldenGate SNP genotyping service
    contracts. We introduced our Infinium services in early 2006. We
    expect sales from SNP genotyping services contracts to fluctuate
    on a yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix and number
    of contracts that are completed. The timing of completion of a
    SNP genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the
    customer’s schedule for delivering the SNPs and samples to
    us.

Government grants and other research funding decreased to
    $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $1.8 million for the year ended January 1, 2006, due
    primarily to the completion of several projects funded by grants
    from the National Institutes of Health. We do not expect
    research revenue to be a material component of our revenue going
    forward.

Cost of product and service and other revenue represents
    manufacturing costs incurred in the production process,
    including component materials, assembly labor and overhead,
    installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as
    costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf
    of our customers. Costs related to research revenue are included
    in research and development expense. Cost of product revenue
    increased to $51.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $19.9 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2006, primarily driven by higher
    consumable and instrument sales. Cost of product revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 included stock-based
    compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R totaling $1.3 million. Gross margin
    on product revenue increased to 67.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to 65.5% for the year ended
    January 1, 2006. The increase in gross margin percentage is
    primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix, as well as
    decreased manufacturing costs. A higher percentage of our
    revenue in 2006 was generated from the sale of consumables,
    which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other
    products. The decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due
    to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable
    negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our
    manufacturing processes. This increase in gross margin was
    offset, in part, by the impact of stock-based compensation
    charges, which decreased our gross margin by 83 basis
    points in 2006 compared to 2005.

Cost of service and other revenue increased to $8.1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $3.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2006,
    primarily due to higher service revenue. Cost of service and
    other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 included
    stock-based



compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R totaling $0.2 million. Gross margin
    on service and other revenue decreased to 70.6% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 76.6% for the year
    ended January 1, 2006. The decrease is due primarily to a
    change in the mix of projects, as well as the impact of
    stock-based compensation charges, the latter having decreased
    our service and other revenue gross margin by 85 basis
    points in 2006 compared to 2005.

We expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross
    margins. However, we expect our market to become increasingly
    price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to
    year and quarter to quarter.

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of
    salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory
    supplies and other expenses related to the design, development,
    testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research
    and development expenses as they are incurred.

Research and development expenses increased to
    $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $27.8 million for the year ended
    January 1, 2006. Research and development expenses for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006
    included stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting
    from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R totaling
    $3.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Exclusive
    of these stock-based compensation charges, the increase in
    research and development expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 is primarily due to the development of
    our recently-acquired VeraCode technology purchased in
    conjunction with our acquisition of CyVera in April 2005. The
    Company plans to launch its first products resulting from this
    acquisition during the first quarter of 2007. Research and
    development expenses related to the VeraCode technology
    increased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006, compared to the year ended January 1, 2006. In
    addition, costs to support our Oligator technology platform and
    BeadArray research activities decreased $1.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year
    ended January 1, 2006.

We believe a substantial investment in research and development
    is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into
    additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and
    development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we
    expand our product base and integrate the operations of Solexa
    into our business.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $10.6 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year
    ended January 1, 2006. The increase is primarily due to
    increases of $6.5 million attributable to personnel-related
    expenses, $3.2 million of stock-based compensation expense
    and



$0.9 million attributable to other non-personnel-related
    costs, mainly sales and marketing activities for our existing
    and new products. General and administrative expenses increased
    $15.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to the year ended January 1, 2006, due to
    increases of $5.5 million of stock-based compensation
    expense, $5.3 million in outside legal costs related to the
    Affymetrix litigation, $3.1 million in personnel-related
    expenses associated with the growth of our business and
    $1.4 million in outside consulting costs. Outside
    consulting costs primarily include tax and audit fees and
    general legal expenses not associated with the Affymetrix
    litigation.

We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to
    increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff, add sales
    and marketing infrastructure, incur increased litigation costs
    and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business.

    transaction costs and gains and losses on disposals of assets.
    Interest and other expense, net, decreased to $0.6 million
    for the year ended January 1, 2006, compared to
    $0.7 million for the year ended January 2, 2005.

Interest expense was $11,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $7,000 for the year ended
    January 1, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2006
    and January 1, 2006, we recorded approximately
    $0.4 million in losses due to foreign currency
    transactions. In addition in 2006, we recorded $0.1 million
    related to losses on disposal of assets, compared to
    $0.3 million of losses in 2005.

The provision for income taxes was approximately
    $2.7 million in 2006, up from $0.2 million in 2005. In
    2006, the provision principally consists of federal and state
    alternative minimum tax and income tax expense related to
    foreign operations. In 2005, the provision for income taxes
    consisted of income tax expense related to foreign operations.



During the year ended December 31, 2006, we utilized
    approximately $25.9 million and $16.6 million of our
    federal and state net operating loss carryforwards,
    respectively, to reduce our federal and state income taxes. As
    of December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    approximately $76.4 million and $39.1 million,
    respectively; which begin to expire in 2022 and 2013,
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also
    had U.S. federal and state research and development tax
    credit carryforwards of approximately $6.4 million and
    $6.3 million respectively; which begin to expire in 2018
    and 2019 respectively, unless previously utilized.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant
    future changes in our ownership structure. These annual
    limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses
    and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to
    Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax
    assets as of December 31, 2006.

Based upon the available evidence as of December 31, 2006,
    we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not the
    remaining deferred tax assets in the U.S. will be realized.
    Therefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against
    the U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately
    $36.5 million.

Total revenue for the years ended January 1, 2006 and
    January 2, 2005 was $73.5 million and
    $50.6 million, respectively. This represents an increase of
    $22.9 million for 2005, or 45%, compared to 2004.

Product revenue increased to $57.8 million for the year
    ended January 1, 2006 from $40.5 million for the year
    ended January 2, 2005. The increase in 2005 was primarily
    due to higher BeadStation, consumable and, to a lesser extent,
    oligo sales. Growth in consumable sales was due to the launch of
    several new products, as well as the growth in our installed
    base of BeadStations. As of January 1, 2006, we had shipped
    a total of 126 BeadArray Readers.

Service and other revenue increased to $13.9 million in
    2005 from $8.1 million in 2004. The increase in service and
    other revenue was primarily due to higher demand for third-party
    SNP genotyping service contracts during the 2005 period. In
    addition, due to the achievement of a milestone associated with
    our collaboration agreement with Invitrogen, we recognized
    revenue of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.
    These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue
    related to the International HapMap Project. We completed all
    revenue-generating genotyping services for the International
    HapMap project early in the first quarter of 2005. We expect
    sales from third-party SNP genotyping services contracts to
    fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix
    and number of contracts that are completed. The timing of
    completion of a SNP genotyping services contract is highly
    dependent on the customer’s schedule for delivering the
    SNPs and samples to us.



Government grants and other research funding decreased to
    $1.8 million for the year ended January 1, 2006 from
    $2.0 million for the year ended January 2, 2005, due
    primarily to a decrease in internal research spending for our
    grants from the National Institutes of Health.

Cost of product and service and other revenue represents
    manufacturing costs incurred in the production process,
    including component materials, assembly labor and overhead,
    installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as
    costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf
    of our customers. Costs related to research revenue are included
    in research and development expense. Cost of product and service
    and other revenue increased to $23.2 million for the year
    ended January 1, 2006, compared to $13.3 million for
    the year ended January 2, 2005 due primarily to the
    significant increase in product revenue. Gross margin on product
    and service and other revenue was 68% for 2005, compared to 73%
    for 2004.

Cost of product revenue increased to $19.9 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2006, compared to $11.6 million
    for the year ended January 2, 2005, due to the significant
    increase in product revenue. Gross margin on product revenue
    decreased to 66% for the year ended January 1, 2006,
    compared to 71% for the year ended January 2, 2005. The
    decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the
    impact of product mix. A higher percentage of our revenue in
    2005 was generated from the sale of instrumentation, which
    generally has a lower gross margin than other products. Other
    factors contributing to the decrease include decreased gross
    margins related to our consumable and oligo sales. Lower
    consumable margins can be primarily attributed to lower average
    selling prices on consumable sales in 2005, compared to 2004,
    which were partially offset by decreased manufacturing costs. In
    addition, the gross margin associated with oligo products sold
    as a part of the Invitrogen collaboration was lower when
    compared to the prior year. The change in oligo gross margin was
    due to the fact that, under the Invitrogen collaboration, we no
    longer sell oligos directly. As a result, the gross margin
    related to this product line decreased; however, the net margin
    has increased due to the fact that most of the sales and
    marketing expenses surrounding the oligo business have shifted
    to our collaboration partner, Invitrogen.

Cost of service and other revenue increased to $3.3 million
    for the year ended January 1, 2006, compared to
    $1.7 million for the year ended January 2, 2005. Gross
    margin on service and other revenue decreased to 77% for the
    year ended January 1, 2006 from 79% in the year ended
    January 2, 2005. The decrease is due primarily to a change
    in the mix of projects and decreased average selling prices.

We expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross
    margins. However, we expect our market to become increasingly
    price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to
    year and quarter to quarter.

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of
    salaries and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory
    supplies and other expenses related to the design, development,
    testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research
    and development expenses as they are incurred.

Research and development expenses increased to
    $27.8 million for the year ended January 1, 2006,
    compared to $21.5 million for the year ended
    January 2, 2005. Research and development expenses for the
    years ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005
    included stock-based compensation expense of approximately
    $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Exclusive
    of these stock-based compensation charges, the increase in
    research and development expenses is primarily due to the
    development expenses incurred to develop our newly-acquired
    Microbead technology purchased in conjunction with our
    acquisition of CyVera in April 2005. Research and development
    expenses related to the VeraCode technology totaled
    approximately $3.2 million in 2005. Additional factors
    contributing to the increased research and development expenses
    during 2005 relate to increased costs of $2.1 million
    associated with the cost of BeadArray research activities and
    $1.3 million related to research costs to support our
    Oligator technology platform. We believe a substantial
    investment in research and development is essential to remaining
    competitive and expanding into additional markets. Accordingly,
    we expect our research and development expenses to increase as
    we expand our product base and integrate the operations of
    Solexa into our business.

    January 2, 2005 included stock-based compensation expense
    of approximately $0.2 million and $0.5 million,
    respectively. Sales and marketing expenses increased
    $3.6 million, of which $2.7 million was attributable
    to personnel related expenses for the build-out of our sales
    force and customer support staff, and $0.9 million is
    attributable to other non-personnel-related costs, including
    sales and marketing activities for our existing and new
    products. General and administrative expenses decreased by
    $1.0 million in 2005, compared to 2004, due primarily to a
    $2.5 million decrease in litigation expenses and a
    $0.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense,
    partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in
    personnel-related expenses.

We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to
    accelerate as we expand our staff, add sales and marketing
    infrastructure and incur increased litigation costs and
    additional costs to support the growth in our business.

During 2005, we recorded non-cash compensation expense for
    accelerated vesting of options for certain employees totaling
    approximately $0.1 million. This compensation was provided
    as incentive to continue to work as key members of the sales
    team associated with the Invitrogen collaboration.

During the year ended January 1, 2006, we recorded
    $15.8 million of acquired in-process research and
    development (IPR&D) resulting from the CyVera acquisition.
    These amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates because the
    acquired technology had not yet reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative future uses. At the
    acquisition date, CyVera’s ongoing research and development
    initiatives were primarily the development of its VeraCode
    technology and the BeadXpress Reader. The IPR&D charge
    related to the CyVera acquisition was made up of two projects
    that were approximately 50% and 25% complete at the date of
    acquisition. The discount rate applied to calculate the
    IPR&D charge was 30%. Acquisitions of businesses, products
    or technologies by us in the future may result in substantial
    charges for acquired IPR&D that may cause fluctuations in
    our interim or annual operating results. There were no charges
    resulting from any acquisitions during the same period in 2006

    related to its foreign operations.

We incurred net operating losses for the years ended
    January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005 and, accordingly,
    we did not pay any U.S. federal or state income taxes. We
    have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the
    resulting net deferred tax asset, as the future realization of
    the tax benefit is uncertain. As of January 1, 2006, we had
    net operating loss carryforwards for federal and California tax
    purposes of approximately $103.7 million and
    $40.1 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2018
    and 2006, respectively, unless previously utilized.

As of January 1, 2006, we also had U.S. federal and
    California research and development tax credit carryforwards of
    approximately $4.1 million and $3.8 million,
    respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to

Our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to
    Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, and
    similar state provisions, as a result of changes in our
    ownership structure. CyVera Corporation had an ownership change

Our operating activities generated cash of $39.0 million in
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to using cash of
    $9.0 million in the year ended January 1, 2006. Net
    cash provided by operating activities in the year ended

    following: net income of $40.0 million; $14.3 million
    related to non-cash stock compensation expense resulting from
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123R; an $11.5 million
    increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities driven by
    increases in general business activity associated with our sales
    growth, as well as expenses associated with the expansion of our
    corporate infrastructure to accommodate this growth; non-cash
    charges of $6.1 million for depreciation and amortization;
    a $5.9 million increase in other long-term liabilities
    primarily due to deferred revenue associated with the agreement
    with Genizon Biosciences and the deCODE genetics collaboration;
    and a $1.8 million increase in income taxes payable. These
    sources were partially offset by a $21.7 million increase
    in accounts receivable and a $9.7 million increase in
    inventory primarily due to our significant sales growth of 151%
    during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the
    year ended January 1, 2006, which resulted from increased
    customer demand and introduction of our new products and
    services into the market; a $5.3 million increase in other
    assets primarily due to increased long-term cost of sales
    associated with Genizon and deCODE and capitalized costs
    associated with the Solexa acquisition; a $1.6 million
    increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily
    associated with increased prepaid software licenses and
    insurance, as well as an increase in interest receivable,
    $1.4 million for an incremental tax benefit related to
    stock option exercises and an increase of $0.6 million in
    deferred income taxes. Net cash used in operating activities in
    the year ended January 1, 2006 was primarily the result of
    a net loss from operations of $20.9 million, a
    $6.0 million payment for a litigation judgment, a
    $7.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a
    $6.5 million increase in inventory, reduced by a
    $7.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities, a $3.2 million increase in long-term
    liabilities primarily related to payments received from
    Invitrogen recorded as deferred revenue, non-cash charges of
    $4.1 million for depreciation and amortization and a
    non-cash acquired IPR&D charge of $15.8 million related
    to the CyVera acquisition.

Our investing activities used cash of $160.7 million in the
    year ended December 31, 2006, compared to using cash of
    $1.5 million in the year ended January 1, 2006. Cash
    used in investing activities in the year ended December 31,
    2006 was primarily due to the purchase of

available-for-sale

securities totaling $236.3 million, a $50.0 million
    investment in Solexa, and the purchase of a $3.0 million
    secured convertible debenture in Genizon. Further,
    $15.1 million was used for the purchase of property and
    equipment primarily related to the expansion of our
    manufacturing capacity. Our manufacturing capacity for BeadChips
    has increased approximately fourfold over the level as of
    January 1, 2006. These uses of cash were partially offset
    by $143.8 million provided by sales and maturities of

available-for-sale

securities. Cash used by investing activities in the year ended
    January 1, 2006 was due to $11.4 million used for the
    purchase of property and equipment and $2.4 million paid
    for the acquisition of CyVera, reduced by $12.2 million
    from the sale or maturity of investment securities used to
    provide operating funds for our business.

Our financing activities provided $109.3 million in the in
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $6.0 million in the year ended January 1, 2006. Cash
    provided by financing activities in the year ended
    December 31, 2006 was primarily due to $96.5 million
    in net proceeds from a public stock offering completed in May
    2006, as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock from
    option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases
    totaling $11.4 million. Cash provided from financing
    activities in the year ended January 1, 2006 was primarily
    proceeds from the issuance of common stock from option exercises.



In February 2007, we issued $400 million principal amount
    of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014. The net proceeds
    from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’
    discount and offering expenses, were approximately
    $390.3 million. We used approximately $202 million of
    the net proceeds to purchase shares of our common stock in
    privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the
    offering. We used $46.6 million of the net proceeds of this
    offering to pay the cost of convertible note hedge and warrant
    transactions, which are designed to reduce the potential
    dilution upon conversion of the notes. We intend to use the
    balance of the net proceeds for other general corporate
    purposes, which may include acquisitions and additional
    purchases of our common stock. The notes mature on
    February 15, 2014 and bear interest semi-annually at a rate
    of 0.625% per year, payable on February 15 and August
    15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007. In addition,
    we may in certain circumstances be obligated to pay additional
    interest. If a “designated event,” as defined in the
    indenture for the notes, occurs, holders of the notes may
    require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for
    cash at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the
    notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In
    addition, upon conversion of the notes, we must pay the
    principal portion in cash. The notes will become convertible
    only in certain circumstances based on conditions relating to
    the trading price of the notes and our common stock or upon the
    occurrence of specified corporate events. However, the notes
    will be convertible at any time from, and including,
    November 15, 2013 through the third scheduled trading day
    immediately preceding February 15, 2014.

We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and
    income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating
    needs for at least the next twelve months. Operating needs
    include the planned costs to operate our business, including
    amounts required to fund working capital and capital
    expenditures. At the present time, we have no material
    commitments for capital expenditures. However, our future
    capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds
    will depend on many factors, including the successful resolution
    of our legal proceedings with Affymetrix, our ability to
    successfully commercialize our sequencing systems and to expand
    our SNP genotyping services product lines, scientific progress
    in our research and development programs, the magnitude of those
    programs, competing technological and market developments and
    the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or
    acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement
    our product and service offerings. Therefore, we may require
    additional funding in the future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
    finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have
    been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
    sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
    purposes. As of December 31, 2006, we were not involved in
    any SPE transactions.

In January 2002, we purchased two newly constructed buildings
    and assumed a $26.0 million,

ten-year

mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. In
    June 2004, we entered into a conditional agreement to sell our
    land and buildings for $42.0 million and to lease back such
    property for an initial term of ten years. The sale was
    completed in August 2004 at which time the lease was signed.
    After the repayment of the remaining $25.2 million debt and
    other related transaction expenses, we received
    $15.5 million in net cash proceeds. We removed the land and
    net book value of the buildings of $36.9 million from our
    balance sheet and are recording the resulting $3.7 million
    gain on the sale of the property over the lease term in
    accordance with SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for
    Leases.

Under the terms of the lease, we made a
    $1.9 million security deposit, with monthly rental payments
    of $318,643 for the first year with an annual increase of 3% in
    each subsequent year through 2014. The current monthly rent
    under this lease is $338,048. On February 14, 2007, we
    extended this lease. The terms of the new lease provide for
    monthly rent increases each year to a maximum of
    $504,710 per month during the last year of the lease, which
    is now 2023. We have the option to extend the term of the lease
    for three additional five-year periods.



As of December 31, 2006, we also leased an office and
    laboratory facility in Connecticut, additional office,
    distribution and storage facilities in San Diego, and four
    foreign facilities located in Japan, Singapore, China and the
    Netherlands under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at
    various times through July 2011. These leases contain renewal
    options ranging from one to five years.

As of December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations were
    (in thousands):

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate
    Sensitivity

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market
    value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by
    fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating
    rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest
    rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our
    invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk
    and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in
    investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a
    relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio,
    and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move
    in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve
    would not materially affect the fair value of our interest
    sensitive financial instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

Although most of our revenue is realized in U.S. dollars,
    some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies.
    As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors
    such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak
    economic conditions in foreign markets. The functional
    currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local
    currencies. Accordingly, the accounts of these operations are
    translated from the local currency to the U.S. dollar using
    the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date
    for the balance sheet accounts, and using the average exchange
    rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. The
    effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity.



Periodically, we hedge significant foreign currency firm sales
    commitments and accounts receivable with forward contracts. We
    only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign
    currency exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
    primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign
    currency exposures and they generally have terms of one year or
    less. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges
    and accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains
    or losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are
    reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and
    losses for the effective portion are recognized with the
    underlying hedge transaction. As of December 31, 2006, we
    had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. The
    notional settlement amount of the foreign currency forward
    contracts outstanding at December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006 were $0 and $0.1 million,
    respectively. As of January 1, 2006, we had one outstanding
    contract with an immaterial fair value, representing an
    unrealized gain, which was included in other current assets at
    January 1, 2006. We settled foreign exchange contracts of
    $0.1 million and $5.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.
    We did not hold any derivative financial instruments prior to
    fiscal 2004.

Controls and
    Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
    (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
    improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
    recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal
    controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable
    laws and our established financial policies.



We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2006. Based
    upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2006, our disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective to ensure that (a) the information required
    to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
    under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or
    persons performing similar functons, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our
    management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
    matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
    reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
    objectives, and our management have concluded that the
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
    company have been detected.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with
    the participation of our management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in
    our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2006 and that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting. That evaluation did
    not identify any such change.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment
    of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006. This report, which
    expresses an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
    of and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Illumina, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the COSO criteria). Illumina, Inc.’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Illumina, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
    Illumina, Inc., maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of
    Illumina, Inc. and our report dated February 23, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Illumina, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and January 1,
    2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Illumina, Inc., at December 31, 2006
    and January 1, 2006, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, Illumina, Inc.
    changed its method of accounting for share-based payments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Organization and
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
    and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on April 28,
    1998. The Company is a leading developer, manufacturer and
    marketer of next-generation life-science tools and integrated
    systems for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function. Using the Company’s proprietary
    technologies, the Company provides a comprehensive line of
    products and services that currently serve the sequencing,
    genotyping and gene expression markets, and the Company expects
    to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. The
    Company’s tools provide researchers around the world with
    the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
    necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to
    extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics
    and proteomics. The Company believes this information will
    enable researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological
    function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical
    research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit
    better choices of drugs for individual patients.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company
    and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
    and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
    Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
    14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
    June 30, and September 30. The years ended
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 were both
    52 weeks.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    current year presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, goodwill and
    related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly
    liquid investments primarily in money market-type funds.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities

, to its investments. Under
    SFAS No. 115, the Company classifies its investments
    as

“available-for-sale”

and records such assets at estimated fair value in the balance
    sheet, with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported in
    stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s excess cash balances were primarily invested in
    marketable debt securities, including commercial paper, auction
    rate certificates and corporate bonds and notes, with strong
    credit ratings or short maturity mutual funds providing similar
    financial returns. The Company limits the amount of investment
    exposure as to institutions, maturity and investment type. The
    cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific
    identification method. The Company did not record any gross
    realized gains for the years ended December 31, 2006 or
    January 1, 2006. For the year ended January 2, 2005,
    gross realized gains totaled $453,750. Gross realized losses
    totaled approximately $35,000, $0, and $0 for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005,
    respectively. Further, there were no investments that have been
    in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than twelve
    months as of December 31, 2006.

Restricted
    Cash

As of December 31, 2006, restricted cash, included in cash
    and cash equivalents, consisted of bank guarantees totaling
    approximately $250,000 associated with two sales contracts
    during 2006. Both guarantees are scheduled to be released during
    2007. There was no restricted cash as of January 1, 2006.

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial
    instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
    notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
    approximate fair value.

Accounts and
    Notes Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net invoice value and
    notes receivable are recorded at contractual value plus earned
    interest. Interest income on notes receivable is recognized
    according to the terms of each related agreement. The Company
    considers receivables past due based on the contractual payment
    terms. The Company reviews its exposure to amounts receivable
    and reserves specific amounts if collectibility is no longer
    reasonably assured. The Company also reserves a percentage of
    its trade receivable balance based on collection history. The
    Company re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and
    adjusts its reserves as needed.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable are
    financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk. Most of the Company’s cash
    and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2006 were deposited
    with financial institutions in the United States and the
    Company’s investment policy restricts the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer and to any one type of investment,
    other than securities issued by the U.S. Government. The
    Company has historically not experienced significant credit
    losses from accounts receivable. The Company performs a regular
    review of customer activity and associated credit risks and
    generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a percentage of its
    trade receivable balance based on collection history and
    re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

The Company’s products require customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
    Company obtains certain key components included in its products
    from single vendors. No assurance can be given that these or
    other product components will be available in sufficient
    quantities at acceptable costs in the future.

Approximately 44%, 38% and 52% of the Company’s revenue for
    the years ended December 31, 2006, January 1, 2006 and
    January 2, 2005 was derived from shipments to customers
    outside the United States. Approximately 39% and 48% of the
    Company’s net accounts receivable balance as of
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively,
    was related to customers outside the United States. Sales
    to territories outside of the United States are generally
    denominated in U.S. dollars. International sales entail a
    variety of risks, including currency exchange fluctuations,
    longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts
    receivable collection. The Company is also subject to general
    geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic
    instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. The
    risks of international sales are mitigated in part by the extent
    to which sales are geographically distributed.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which
    approximates actual cost) or market. Inventory includes raw
    materials and finished goods that may be used in the research
    and development process and such items are expensed as consumed.
    Provisions for slow moving, excess and obsolete inventories are
    provided based on product life cycle and development plans,
    product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and
    inventory levels.

Property and
    Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
    impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets (generally three to seven years) using the
    straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
    computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
    useful life of the related assets.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets consist of license agreements and acquired
    technology. The cost of the Company’s license agreements
    was $944,450 and the Company has amortized $836,450 through
    December 31, 2006. Amortization expense related to license
    agreements for the years ending December 31, 2006,
    January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005 was $51,083,
    $292,033 and $300,000, respectively. The licenses will be fully
    amortized by 2010.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

if indicators
    of impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of
    the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the
    carrying value of such assets can be recovered through
    undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is
    indicated, the Company measures the future discounted cash flows
    associated with the use of the asset and adjusts the value of
    the asset accordingly. While the Company’s historical
    operating and cash flow losses are indicators of impairment, the
    Company believes the current and future cash flows to be
    received from the long-lived assets recorded at
    December 31, 2006 will exceed the assets’ carrying
    value, and accordingly the Company has not recognized any
    impairment losses through December 31, 2006.

Reserve for
    Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    instrumentation. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company
    establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses
    associated with system sales. This expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of revenue.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale
    of products and services. Product revenue consists of sales of
    arrays, reagents, instrumentation, and oligos. Service and other
    revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping
    services, extended warranty sales and revenue earned from
    milestone payments.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In
    instances where final acceptance of the product or system is
    required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria
    have been met. All revenue is recorded net of any applicable
    allowances for returns or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    However, in the case of BeadLabs, revenue is recognized upon the
    completion of installation, training and the receipt of customer
    acceptance. Revenue for genotyping services is recognized when
    earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping analysis
    data is delivered to the customer or as specific milestones are
    achieved.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    the Company ensures there are no refund rights. If payment terms
    are based on future performance, the Company defers revenue
    recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable. The
    Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors,
    including past transaction history with the customer and the
    creditworthiness of the customer. If the Company determines that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. The Company also sells separately priced maintenance
    (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or
    two years, upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue
    for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term
    of the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If the Company were to experience an
    increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its
    warrantied products were greater than its estimates, gross
    margins could be adversely affected.

While the majority of its sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, the Company does enter into agreements
    that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and
    conditions. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to
    determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
    deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should
    be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be
    allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize
    revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue
    should be recognized. The Company recognizes revenue for
    delivered elements only when it determines that the fair values
    of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties
    regarding customer acceptance.

Some of the Company’s agreements contain multiple elements
    that include milestone payments. Revenue from a milestone
    achievement is recognized when earned, as evidenced by
    acknowledgement from the Company’s collaborator, provided
    that (i) the milestone event is substantive and its
    achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the
    agreement, (ii) the milestone represents the culmination of
    an earnings process, (iii) the milestone payment is
    non-refundable and (iv) the performance obligations for
    both the Company and its collaborators after the milestone
    achievement will continue at a level comparable to the level
    before the milestone achievement. If all of these criteria are
    not met, the milestone achievement is recognized over the
    remaining minimum period of the Company’s performance
    obligations under the agreement. The Company defers
    non-refundable upfront fees received under its collaborations
    and recognizes them over the period the related services are
    provided or over the estimated collaboration term using various
    factors specific to the collaboration. Advance payments received
    in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue
    until earned.

A third source of revenue, research revenue, consists of amounts
    earned under research agreements with government grants, which
    is recognized in the period during which the related costs are
    incurred. All revenue is recorded net of any applicable
    allowances for returns or discounts.

Shipping and
    Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
    revenue and totaled $1.8 million, $1.3 million and
    $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, respectively.

Research and
    Development

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
    internal and grant-sponsored research and development. Research
    and development expenses include salaries, contractor fees,
    facilities costs, utilities and allocations of benefits.
    Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed
    in the period incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    costs were $1.9 million, $1.2 million and
    $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
    Share-Based Payment, the Company recognizes excess tax benefits
    associated with share-based compensation to stockholders’
    equity only when realized. When assessing whether excess tax
    benefits relating to share-based compensation have been
    realized, the Company follows the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currencies of the Company’s wholly-owned
    subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. Accordingly,
    all balance sheet accounts of these operations are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated
    using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
    The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these
    subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity under the
    caption “accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss).”

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 2, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment

, which addresses the accounting for stock-based
    payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee
    services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the
    enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair
    value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or that may be
    settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. In January
    2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides
    supplemental implementation guidance for
    SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the
    ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions
    using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles
    Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued
    to Employees

, and instead generally requires that such
    transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method.
    The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under
    SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that used for pro forma
    disclosures under SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

, in prior periods. The Company has
    elected to use the modified prospective transition method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 123R and, accordingly, prior
    periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123R. The modified prospective transition
    method requires that stock-based compensation expense be
    recorded for all new and unvested stock options, restricted
    stock and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares that are
    ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is
    rendered. Stock-based compensation expense for awards granted
    prior to January 2, 2006 is based on the grant date
    fair-value as determined under APB No. 25. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded an
    incremental $14.3 million, respectively, of stock-based
    compensation expense as a result of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Net income per diluted share was
    reduced by $0.29 for the year ended December 31, 2006 as a
    result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Stock-based
    compensation expense capitalized as part of inventory as of
    December 31, 2006 was approximately $0.1 million. As
    of December 31, 2006, approximately $46.8 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options,
    restricted stock and ESPP shares are expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of approximately two years.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    measured compensation expense for its employee stock-based
    compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed
    by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure
    provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by
    SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

, as if
    the fair-value-based method had been applied in measuring
    stock-based compensation expense. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
    when the exercise price of the Company’s employee stock
    options was not less than the market price of the underlying
    stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was
    recognized.

SFAS No. 123R requires the use of a valuation model to
    calculate the fair-value of stock-based awards. The Company has
    elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model,
    which incorporates various assumptions including volatility,
    expected life, and interest rates. The expected volatility is
    based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common
    stock over the most recent period generally commensurate with
    the estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options,
    adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably
    expected to recur and other relevant factors. The expected life
    of an award is based on historical experience and on the terms
    and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees.

The assumptions used for the specified reporting periods and the
    resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
    options granted and for stock purchases under the ESPP during
    those periods are as follows:

Net Income (
    Loss) per Share

Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share is
    presented in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings
    per Share,

for all periods presented. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 128, basic net income (loss) per share is
    computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common
    stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to
    repurchase. Diluted net income (loss) per share is typically
    computed using the weighted average number of common and
    dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options using the
    treasury stock method. The following table presents the

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other
    comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
    unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s

Acquisition of
    CyVera Corporation

On April 8, 2005, the Company completed its acquisition of
    100% of the voting equity interests of CyVera Corporation
    (CyVera). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
    of February 22, 2005 (the Merger Agreement), by and among
    Illumina, Semaphore Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina (Merger
    Sub), and CyVera, Merger Sub merged with and into CyVera, with
    CyVera surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina. The
    results of CyVera’s operations have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements since the
    acquisition date of April 8, 2005.

CyVera was created in October 2003 to commercialize its
    technology and optical instrumentation/reader concepts
    (BeadXpress Reader). The Company believes that the CyVera
    technology, branded VeraCode, is highly complementary to the
    Company’s own portfolio of products and services and will
    enhance the Company’s capabilities to service its existing
    customers as well as accelerate the development of additional
    technologies, products and services. The Company believes that
    integrating CyVera’s capabilities with the Company’s
    technologies will better position the Company to address the
    emerging biomarker research and development and in-vitro and
    molecular diagnostic markets. The Company plans to begin
    shipments of its first products resulting from this acquisition
    during the first quarter of 2007.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company issued
    1.6 million shares (the Shares) of Illumina common stock,
    paid $2.3 million in cash and assumed the net liabilities
    of CyVera. In addition, the Company assumed the outstanding
    stock options of CyVera. Approximately 250,000 of the Shares
    were deposited into an escrow account with a bank to satisfy any
    claims for indemnification made by the Company or CyVera
    pursuant to the Merger Agreement. No claims for indemnification
    were made and the escrow agent released the shares from escrow
    during the second quarter of 2006.

The results of CyVera’s operations have been included in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date
    of the acquisition. The total cost of the acquisition is as

The fair value of the Shares was determined based on the average
    closing price of the Company’s common stock for five
    trading days preceding, and following, February 22, 2005
    (the date the transaction was announced). The Company believes
    that this time period gives proper consideration to matters such
    as price fluctuations and quantities traded and represents a
    reasonable period before and after the date on which the terms
    of the acquisition were agreed. Based on these closing prices,
    the Company estimated the fair value of its common stock to be
    $9.167 per share, which equates to a total fair value of
    $14.4 million.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

the goodwill is not amortized, but will
    be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a
    fair-value-based test. None of this goodwill is expected to be
    deductible for tax purposes. The Company performs its annual
    test for impairment of goodwill in May of each year. The Company
    is required to perform a periodic assessment between annual
    tests in certain circumstances. The Company has performed its
    annual test of goodwill as of May 1, 2006 and has
    determined there was no impairment of goodwill during 2006.

The Company allocated $15.8 million of the purchase price
    to in-process research and development projects. In-process
    research and development (IPR&D) represents the valuation of
    acquired, to-be-completed research projects. At the acquisition
    date, CyVera’s ongoing research and development initiatives
    were primarily involved with the development of its VeraCode
    technology and the BeadXpress Reader. These two projects were
    approximately 50% and 25% complete at the date of acquisition,
    respectively. As of December 31, 2006, these two projects
    were approximately 90% and 80% complete, respectively.

The value assigned to purchased IPR&D was determined by
    estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
    flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to
    their present value. The revenue projections used to value the
    IPR&D were, in some cases, reduced based on the probability
    of developing a new technology, and considered the relevant
    market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology,
    and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions
    by the Company and its competitors. The resulting net cash flows
    from such projects are based on the Company’s estimates of
    cost of sales, operating expenses, and income taxes from such
    projects. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to
    their present value were based on estimated cost of capital
    calculations. Due to the nature of the forecast and the risks
    associated with the projected growth and profitability of the
    developmental projects, discount rates of 30% were considered
    appropriate for the IPR&D. The Company believes that these
    discount rates were commensurate with the projects’ stage
    of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates
    described above.

If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and
    profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected
    in future periods. The Company believes that the foregoing
    assumptions used in the IPR&D analysis were reasonable at
    the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however,
    that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected
    project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events
    associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. At
    the date of acquisition, the development of these projects had
    not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and
    development in progress had no alternative future uses.
    Accordingly, these costs were charged to expense in the second
    quarter of 2005.

The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results
    of the Company’s operations for the years ended
    January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005 as though the
    acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the periods

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires
    that the Company recognize the impact of a tax position in its
    financial statements if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective
    as of the beginning of the Company’s 2007 fiscal year, with
    the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
    recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 to
    have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations
    and financial position, and the Company is continuing to
    evaluate the impact, if any, the adoption of
    FIN No. 48 will have on its disclosure requirements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. This Statement applies only to
    fair value measurements that are already required or permitted
    by other accounting standards. Accordingly, this Statement does
    not require any new fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2007. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 will have on its consolidated results of
    operations and financial position.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities,

requires that all derivatives be
    recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in
    current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on
    whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge
    transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The
    Company assesses, both at its inception and on an on-going
    basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
    transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in
    cash flows of hedged items. The Company also assesses hedge
    ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and records the gain or
    loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to
    the extent significant.

Periodically, the Company hedges significant foreign currency
    firm sales commitments and accounts receivable with forward
    contracts. The Company only uses derivative financial
    instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks; the
    Company does not hold any derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes. The Company primarily uses
    forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures
    and they generally have terms of one year or less. These
    contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and
    accordingly, to the extent effective, any unrealized gains or
    losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are reported
    in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses for the
    effective portion are recognized with the underlying hedge
    transaction. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no
    foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. The notional
    settlement amount of the foreign currency forward contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006
    were $0 and $0.1 million, respectively. As of
    January 1, 2006, the Company had one outstanding contract
    with an immaterial fair value, representing an unrealized gain,
    and was included in other current assets at January 1,
    2006. The Company settled foreign exchange contracts of
    $0.1 million and $5.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.
    The Company did not hold any derivative financial instruments
    prior to fiscal 2004.

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued $400 million
    principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2014 (the Notes), which included the exercise of the initial
    purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional
    $50 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. In
    connection with the offering of the notes, the Company entered
    into convertible note hedge transactions with the initial
    purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the counterparties) entitling the Company to
    purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial
    strike price of $43.66 per share, subject to adjustment. In
    addition, the Company sold to these counterparties warrants to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial
    strike price of $62.87 per share, subject to adjustment.
    See Note 15 for further discussion of these transactions.

Warranties and
    Maintenance Contracts

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on genotyping
    and gene expression systems. At the time revenue is recognized,
    the Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty
    expenses associated with system sales. This expense is recorded
    as a component of cost of product revenue. Estimated warranty
    expenses associated with extended maintenance contracts are
    recorded as cost of revenue ratably over the term of the
    maintenance contract.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability during the
    three years ended December 31, 2006 are as follows (in

Commitments and
    Long-term Debt

Building
    Loan

In July 2000, the Company entered into a

10-year

lease to rent space in two newly constructed buildings in
    San Diego that are now occupied by the Company. That lease
    contained an option to purchase the buildings together with
    certain adjacent land that has been approved for construction of
    an additional building. The Company exercised that option and
    purchased the properties in January 2002 and assumed a
    $26.0 million,

10-year

mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. The
    Company made monthly payments of $208,974, representing interest
    and principal, through August 2004. The Company did not record
    interest expense related to this loan for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 or January 1, 2006. Interest expense
    related to this loan was $1.4 million for the year ended
    January 2, 2005.

In June 2004, the Company entered into a conditional agreement
    to sell its land and buildings for $42.0 million and to
    lease back such property for an initial term of ten years. The
    sale was completed in August 2004 at which time the lease was
    signed. After the repayment of the remaining $25.2 million
    debt and other related transaction expenses, the Company
    received $15.5 million in net cash proceeds. The Company
    removed the land and net book value of the buildings of
    $36.9 million from its balance sheet, deferred the
    resulting $3.7 million gain on the sale of the property,
    and is amortizing the deferred gain over the lease term in
    accordance with SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for
    Leases.

The Company leased a portion of the space to a tenant under a
    lease which expired in June 2004. Rental income was recorded as
    an offset to the Company’s facility costs. There was no
    rental income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006. For the year ended January 2, 2005,
    rental income was $409,517.

Capital
    Leases

In April 2000, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 loan
    arrangement to be used at its discretion to finance purchases of
    capital equipment. The loan was secured by the capital equipment
    financed. As of January 1, 2005, all loan payments were
    made, the underlying equipment was purchased and the loan
    arrangement was closed. Depreciation of equipment under capital
    leases was included in depreciation expense. Interest expense
    related to capital leases was $10,500 for the year ended
    January 2, 2005. The Company did not have any capital
    leases during the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006.

Operating
    Leases

In August 2004, the Company entered into a ten-year lease for
    its San Diego facility after the land and building were
    sold (as discussed above). Under the terms of the lease, the
    Company paid a $1.9 million security deposit and is paying
    monthly rent of $318,643 for the first year with an annual
    increase of 3% in each subsequent year through 2014. The current
    monthly rent under this lease is $338,048. On February 14,
    2007, the Company extended this lease. The terms of the new
    lease provide for monthly rent increases each year to a maximum
    of $504,710 per month during the last year of the lease,
    which is now 2023. The Company has the option to extend the term
    of the lease for three additional five-year periods. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 13, the Company records rent
    expense on a straight-line basis and the resulting deferred rent
    is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options
    exercisable as of December 31, 2006 was $212.3 million
    and $89.4 million, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value
    represents the difference between the Company’s closing
    stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period, which
    was $39.31 as of December 29, 2006, and the exercise price
    multiplied by the number of options outstanding. Total intrinsic
    value of options exercised was $34.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006.

2000 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
    adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase
    Plan). A total of 4,827,988 shares of the Company’s
    common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Purchase
    Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase
    common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions,
    during defined offering periods.

The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is
    equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
    The initial offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition,
    beginning with fiscal 2001, the Purchase Plan provides for
    annual increases of shares available for issuance by the lesser
    of 3% of the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s
    common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
    year, 1,500,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined
    by the Company’s board of directors. 266,394, 717,164 and
    585,855 shares were issued under the 2000 Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    As of December 31, 2006, there were 2,762,936 shares
    available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company
    declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the
    Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 (the
    Record Date) to the stockholders of record on that date. Each
    Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
    Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of its
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of
    $100 per unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a person
    or group hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more
    of the outstanding common stock of the Company or announces an
    offer for 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. If a
    person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase, at the exercise price of the right, a number of shares
    of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
    price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or
    other business combination transaction after a person acquires
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each Right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of common shares of the acquiring
    company which at the time of such transaction have a market
    value of two times the exercise price of the right. The Board of
    Directors will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.01 per Right at any time before any such person acquires
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock. The rights expire on May 14, 2011 unless such date
    is extended or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
    the Company.

Affymetrix
    Litigation

On July 26, 2004, Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix) filed a
    complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Delaware alleging that the use, manufacture and sale of the
    Company’s BeadArray products and services, including the
    Company’s Array Matrix and BeadChip products, infringe six
    Affymetrix patents. Affymetrix seeks an injunction against the
    sale of products, if any, that are determined to be infringing
    these patents, unspecified monetary damages, interest and
    attorneys’ fees. On September 15, 2004, the Company
    filed its answer to Affymetrix’ complaint, seeking
    declaratory judgments from the court that it does not infringe
    the Affymetrix patents and that such patents are invalid, and
    the Company filed counterclaims against Affymetrix for unfair
    competition and interference with actual and prospective
    economic advantage.

On February 15, 2006, the court allowed the Company to file
    its first amended answer and counterclaims, adding allegations
    of inequitable conduct with respect to all six asserted
    Affymetrix patents, violation of Section 2 of the Sherman
    Act, and unclean hands. In March 2006, Affymetrix notified the
    Company of its decision to drop one of the six patents from the
    suit, and of its intention to assert infringement of certain
    additional claims of the remaining five patents. The Company has
    filed a motion to preclude Affymetrix from asserting
    infringement of those additional claims. That motion is still
    pending at this time. On June 30, 2006, the court dismissed
    the patent Affymetrix had sought to withdraw from the suit.
    Affymetrix and the Company filed summary judgment motions by the
    July 14, 2006 court-established deadline. On
    August 16, 2006, the court issued a ruling on the Markman
    (claim construction) hearing it had held on April 20, 2006.
    The Company believes the court’s Markman opinion construed
    several key claim terms in favor of the Company and did not
    adversely affect the Company’s defenses and pending
    counterclaims in any material respect. At the request of the
    parties, trial has been rescheduled to March 5, 2007 from
    October 16, 2006. A pre-trial conference was held on
    February 8, 2007 during which the court established a
    multi-phase trial structure with the first phase of the trial to
    begin on March 5, 2007, and addressed related issues. The
    Company believes it has meritorious defenses against each of the
    infringement claims alleged by Affymetrix and intends to defend
    vigorously against this suit. However, the Company cannot be
    sure that it will prevail in this matter. Any unfavorable
    determination, and in particular, any significant cash amounts
    required to be paid by the Company or prohibition of the sale of
    its products and services, could result in a material adverse
    effect on its business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Dr. Anthony
    W. Czarnik v. Illumina, Inc.

On June 15, 2005, Dr. Anthony Czarnik, a former
    employee, filed suit against the Company in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware seeking
    correction of inventorship of certain of the Company’s
    patents and patent applications, and alleging that the Company
    committed inequitable conduct and fraud in not naming him as an
    inventor. Dr. Czarnik seeks an order requiring the Company
    and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to correct the
    inventorship of certain of the Company’s patents and patent
    applications by adding Dr. Czarnik as an inventor, a
    judgment declaring certain of the Company’s patents and
    patent applications unenforceable, unspecified monetary damages
    and attorney’s fees. On August 4, 2005, the Company
    filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing and
    failure to state a claim. While this motion was pending,
    Dr. Czarnik filed an amended complaint on
    September 23, 2005. On October 7, 2005, the Company
    filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of
    standing and failure to state a claim. On July 13, 2006,
    the court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the
    counts of Dr. Czarnik’s complaint dealing with
    correction of inventorship in pending applications and
    inequitable conduct. On July 27, 2006, the Company filed
    its answer to the two remaining counts of the amended complaint
    (correction of inventorship in issued patents, and fraud). There
    has been no trial date set for this case. The Company believes
    it has meritorious defenses against these claims.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of
    Applera Corporation filed suit against Solexa, which the Company
    acquired in a

stock-for-stock

merger on January 26, 2007. Applied Biosystems’ action
    against Solexa, which was filed in California state court in
    Santa Clara County, seeks ownership of patents covering

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies. Solexa filed its answer to the complaint by the
    required deadline. The patents at issue were assigned in 1995 to
    Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx Therapeutics) by a
    former employee, Dr. Stephen Macevicz, who is named as a
    co-defendant in the suit. Lynx, which was originally a unit of
    Applied Biosystems, was spun out of Applied Biosystems in 1992.
    The patents at issue in the suit relate to methods for
    sequencing DNA using successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe
    ligation

(Sequencing-by-Ligation).

The Company’s new Illumina Genome Analyzer system uses a
    different technology, DNA

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which the Company believes is not covered by any of the
    patents at issue in the suit. The Company also believes that the
    MPSS technology used by Lynx did not use the methods covered by
    these patents, and in any event Solexa no longer uses the MPSS
    technologies. The Company believes the suit is not material to
    its current or future business, and the Company has no plans to
    use any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by the patents at issue in the suit.
    Applied Biosystems does not assert any claim for patent
    infringement in the suit.

Termination-of-Employment

Lawsuit

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an unspecified
    amount was filed against the Company by Dr. Anthony W.
    Czarnik, a former employee, in the Superior Court of the State
    of California in connection with the employee’s termination
    of employment with the Company. In June 2002, a California
    Superior Court judgment was rendered against the Company and the
    Company recorded a $7.7 million charge in its financial
    results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover total damages
    and remaining expenses. The Company appealed the decision, and
    in December 2004, the Fourth Appellate District Court of Appeal,
    in San Diego, California, reduced the amount of the award.
    The Company recorded interest expense on the $7.7 million
    during the appeal based on the statutory rate. As a result of
    the revised judgment, the Company reduced the $9.2 million
    liability on its balance sheet to $5.9 million and recorded
    a gain of $3.3 million as a litigation judgment in the
    fourth quarter of 2004. In January 2005, the Company paid the
    $5.9 million and removed the liability from its balance
    sheet.

Litigation
    with Applera Corporation’s Applied Biosystems
    Group

In 1999, the Company entered into a joint development agreement
    with Applied Biosystems Group, an operating group of Applera
    Corporation, under which the companies agreed to jointly develop
    a SNP genotyping system that would combine the Company’s
    BeadArray technology with Applied Biosystems’ assay
    chemistry and scanner technology. In conjunction with the
    agreement, Applied Biosystems agreed to provide the Company with
    non-refundable research and development support of
    $10.0 million, all of which was paid by December 2001 and
    recorded as a liability on the Company’s balance sheet as
    of January 2, 2005. In December 2002, Applied Biosystems
    initiated a patent infringement suit and sought to compel
    arbitration of an alleged breach of the joint development
    agreement. The Company initiated a suit in state court seeking
    to enjoin the arbitration and alleged that Applied Biosystems
    had breached the joint development agreement. In August 2004,
    the Company entered into a settlement and cross-license
    agreement with Applera. As a result of the settlement, the
    Company removed the $10.0 million liability from its
    balance sheet, made a payment of $8.5 million to Applera
    and recorded a gain of $1.5 million as a litigation
    settlement.

Collaborative
    Agreements

Invitrogen
    Corporation

In December 2004, the Company entered into a strategic
    collaboration with Invitrogen Corporation (Invitrogen). The goal
    of the collaboration is to combine the Company’s expertise
    in oligonucleotide manufacturing with the sales, marketing and
    distribution capabilities of Invitrogen. In connection with the
    collaboration, the Company has developed the next generation
    Oligator DNA synthesis technology. This technology includes both
    plate- and tube-based capabilities. Under the terms of the
    agreement, Invitrogen paid the Company an upfront non-refundable
    collaboration payment of $2.3 million during the first
    quarter of 2005. Additionally, Invitrogen made a milestone
    payment of $1.1 million to the Company in November 2005
    upon achievement of a milestone event under the terms of the
    collaboration.

The Company began manufacturing and shipping the plate-based and
    certain tube-based oligo products under the collaboration in the
    third quarter of 2005 and, therefore, has begun to amortize the
    upfront collaboration payment of $2.3 million as product
    revenue over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis.
    The unamortized portion of the collaboration payment has been
    recorded as short- and long-term deferred revenue. The Company
    recorded the $1.1 million milestone payment in service and
    other revenue upon achievement of the milestone during the
    fourth quarter of 2005. The Company recorded revenue related to
    this milestone payment upon its achievement, as evidenced by
    acknowledgment from Invitrogen and due to the fact that
    (i) the milestone event is substantive and its
    achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the
    agreement, (ii) the milestone represents the culmination of
    an earnings process, (iii) the milestone payment is
    non-refundable and (iv) the performance obligations for
    both the Company and Invitrogen after the milestone achievement
    will continue at a level comparable to the level before the
    milestone achievement. In addition, the agreement provides for
    the transfer of the Company’s Oligator technology into two
    Invitrogen facilities outside North America. The Company
    recognizes product revenue upon shipment of collaboration
    products based on the Company’s actual manufacturing cost.
    Collaboration profit, as defined in the collaboration agreement,
    from the sale of collaboration products is divided equally
    between the two companies and is recorded as product revenue.

deCODE
    genetics

In May 2006, the Company and deCODE genetics, ehf. (deCODE)
    executed a Joint Development and Licensing Agreement (the
    Development Agreement). Pursuant to the Development Agreement,
    the parties agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop,
    validate and commercialize specific diagnostic tests for
    variants in genes involved in three disease-related pathways:
    the gene-encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase, linked to heart
    attack; the gene-encoding transcription factor 7-like 2
    (TCF7L2), linked to type 2 diabetes; and the gene-encoding
    BARD1, linked to breast cancer. The Company and deCODE are
    developing diagnostic tests based on these variants for use on
    the Company’s BeadXpress system.

F-29


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Under the agreement, the Company will be responsible for the
    manufacturing, marketing and selling of the diagnostic products.
    The companies will share the development costs of these products
    and split the profits from sales of the diagnostics tests. The
    Development Agreement may be terminated as to a particular
    product under development if one party decides to discontinue
    funding the development of that product, and may be terminated
    in whole by either party if the other party commits an uncured
    material breach, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent.
    Under a separate supply agreement, the Company installed
    instrumentation at deCODE that will enable deCODE to perform
    whole genome association studies on up to 100,000 samples using
    the Company’s Sentrix HumanHap300 BeadChips and associated
    reagents. The Company has deferred approximately
    $2.0 million of revenue for instruments installed during
    the third quarter of 2006 under guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists.

This amount is classified as a long-term
    liability as of December 31, 2006. The Company has also
    deferred approximately $1.3 million of costs related to
    product shipments to deCODE, which are classified as a long-term
    asset as of December 31, 2006.

International
    HapMap Project

The Company was the recipient of a grant from the National
    Institutes of Health covering its participation in the first
    phase of the International HapMap Project, which is a
    $100 million, internationally funded successor project to
    the Human Genome Project that will help identify a map of
    genetic variations that may be used to perform disease-related
    research. The Company was awarded a $9.1 million grant from
    the National Institutes of Health in September 2002 to perform
    genotyping services in connection with the first phase of the
    International HapMap Project that covered basic research
    activities, the development of SNP assays and the genotyping
    performed on those assays. For the year ending December 31,
    2006, the Company did not record any revenue related to this
    project. For the years ending January 1, 2006 and
    January 2, 2005, the Company recorded revenue related to
    this project totaling $0.8 million and $4.6 million,
    respectively.

Investment in
    Genizon BioSciences Inc.

In January 2006, Genizon BioSciences Inc. (Genizon), a Canadian
    company focused on gene discovery, purchased from the Company
    approximately $1.9 million in equipment and committed to
    purchase an additional $4.3 million in consumables. The
    Company understands that Genizon is using the Company’s
    HumanHap300 BeadChip along with the Infinium assay to perform
    whole-genome association studies involving thousands of members
    of the Quebec Founder Population. The goal of the studies is to
    provide understanding of the genetic origins and mechanisms of
    common diseases which may then lead to possible drug targets.

In March 2006, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement
    for Secured Convertible Debentures with Genizon. Pursuant to the
    agreement, the Company purchased a secured convertible debenture
    (the debenture) of Genizon and certain warrants for
    CDN$3.5 million (approximately U.S. $3.0 million).

The debenture is convertible, automatically upon the occurrence
    of a “liquidity event,” as defined in the debenture,
    into Class H Preferred Shares of Genizon. Upon the
    occurrence of certain events, Illumina may be entitled to
    receive additional shares of Genizon’s Class H
    Preferred Shares. The debenture matures two years from issuance
    and bears interest, payable semiannually, at a rate of
    5% per annum for the first year and 12.5% per annum
    for the second year. Unless the debenture is converted before
    maturity, 112.5% of the principal amount of the debenture is due
    upon maturity. The Company also received warrants to purchase
    226,721 shares of Genizon Class H Preferred Shares at
    an exercise price of $1.5437 per share.

As of December 31, 2006, the debenture was recorded at face
    value, which is the fair value, and is classified in accordance
    with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, as an

available-for-sale

security.

The Company has concluded that the purchase of the debenture and
    the concurrent purchase by Genizon of the Company’s
    products are “linked” transactions under guidance
    contained in EITF

No. 00-21.

Since the transactions are considered “linked,” the
    Company has deferred approximately $3.0 million of revenue
    (the face value of the Debentures) as of December 31, 2006,
    related to the Genizon product shipments. The deferred revenue
    is classified as a long-term liability as of December 31,
    2006. This amount is expected to remain in deferred revenue
    until Genizon settles the Debenture in cash or when a liquidity
    event occurs that generates cash or a security that is readily
    convertible into cash. The Company has also deferred
    approximately $1.1 million of costs related to product
    shipments to Genizon as a long-term asset as of
    December 31, 2006. All Genizon shipments that generate
    revenue over the face value of the debenture will be evaluated
    under the Company’s revenue recognition policy, which is
    outlined in Note 1.

Investment in
    Solexa

On November 12, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive
    securities purchase agreement with Solexa in which the Company
    invested approximately $50 million in Solexa in exchange
    for 5,154,639 newly issued shares of Solexa common stock in
    conjunction with the merger of the two companies, completed on
    January 26, 2007. This investment was valued at
    $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006, which
    represented a market value of $13.15 per share of Solexa
    common stock.

    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence. Based upon the available
    evidence as of December 31, 2006, the Company is not able
    to conclude it is more likely than not the remaining deferred
    tax assets in the U.S. will be realized. Therefore, the
    Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the
    U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately
    $36.5 million.

A deferred tax liability of approximately $7.0 million has
    been recorded against the unrealized gain on the investment in
    Solexa, which is included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, as of December 31, 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    approximately $76.4 million and $39.1 million
    respectively; which begin to expire in 2022 and 2013
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, the
    Company also had U.S. federal and state research and
    development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
    $6.4 million and $6.3 million respectively; which
    begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively, unless previously
    utilized.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating losses and
    credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any
    significant future changes in it’s ownership structure.
    These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net
    operating losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous
    limitations due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected
    in the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006.

Included in the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006
    are approximately $2.7 million of pre-acquisition deferred
    tax assets of CyVera Corporation. To the extent these assets are
    recognized, the adjustment will be applied first to reduce to
    zero any goodwill related to the acquisition, and then as a
    reduction to the income tax provision.

Not included in the deferred tax assets as of December 31,
    2006 is approximately $14.7 million of tax benefits related
    to employee stock plans. When realized, the tax benefit of these
    assets will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in
    capital, rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.

Residual United States income taxes have not been provided on
    approximately $0.8 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 since the
    earnings are considered to be permanently invested in the
    operations of such subsidiaries.

In July 2006, FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting
    for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires
    that the Company recognize the impact of a tax position in its
    financial statements if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the
    position. The provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective
    as of the beginning of the Company’s 2007 fiscal year, with
    the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle
    recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 to
    have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations
    and financial position, and the Company is continuing to
    evaluate the impact, if any, the adoption of
    FIN No. 48 will have on its disclosure requirements.

Subsequent
    Events

Acquisition of
    Solexa, Inc.

On January 26, 2007, the Company completed a merger with
    Solexa, Inc. (Solexa), a Delaware corporation, in a

stock-for-stock

merger transaction. In connection with the merger, Solexa
    shareholders received 0.344 of a share of the Company’s
    common stock in exchange for each share of Solexa common stock
    held. The Company issued approximately 13.1 million shares
    of its common stock as consideration for this merger. As a
    result of the merger, Solexa became a direct, wholly-owned
    subsidiary of the Company.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued $400 million
    principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2014 (the Notes), which included the exercise of the initial
    purchasers’ option to purchase up to an additional
    $50 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The net
    proceeds from the offering, after deducting the initial
    purchasers’ discount and offering expenses, were
    approximately $390.3 million. The Company will pay 0.625%
    interest per annum on the principal amount of the Notes, payable
    semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of
    each year, starting on August 15, 2007. The Company used
    approximately $202 million of the net proceeds to purchase
    shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions
    concurrently with the offering.

The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable,
    shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value
    per share, based on an initial conversion rate, subject to
    adjustment, of 22.9029 shares per $1,000 principal amount
    of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $43.66 per share), only in the following
    circumstances and to the following extent: (1) during the
    five

business-day

period after any five consecutive trading period (the
    measurement period) in which the trading price per note for each
    day of such measurement period was less than 97% of the product
    of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common
    stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during
    any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending
    March 31, 2007, if the last reported sale price of the
    Company’s common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130%
    of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (3) upon
    the occurrence of specified events; and (4) the notes will
    be convertible at any time on or after November 15, 2013
    through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    the maturity date.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the Company
    entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the
    initial purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the counterparties) entitling the Company to
    purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial
    strike price of $43.66 per share, subject to adjustment. In
    addition, the Company sold to these counterparties warrants to
    acquire shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial
    strike price of $62.87 per share, subject to adjustment.
    The note hedge transactions and the warrants each cover a number
    of shares that is generally equal to the maximum number of
    shares that are issuable upon conversion of the notes. The cost
    of the convertible note hedge transactions that was not covered
    by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was approximately
    $46.6 million. These transactions are expected to reduce
    the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes if
    the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the
    Company’s common stock exceeds the strike price of the
    convertible note hedge transactions. The warrant transactions
    could have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per
    share to the extent that the price of the Company’s common
    stock during the measurement period at maturity of the warrants
    exceeds the strike price of the warrants.
