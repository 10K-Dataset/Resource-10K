Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function. Using our proprietary
    technologies, we provide a comprehensive line of products and
    services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and
    gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the
    market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading
    genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic
    institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology
    companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with
    the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
    necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to
    extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics
    and proteomics. We believe this information will enable
    researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological
    function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical
    research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit
    better choices of drugs for individual patients.

In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of CyVera
    Corporation (Cyvera). The aggregate consideration for the
    transaction was $17.5 million, consisting of approximately
    1.5 million shares of our common stock and payment of
    approximately $2.3 million of CyVera’s liabilities at
    the closing.



On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    Solexa, Inc. (Solexa) for approximately 13.1 million shares
    of our common stock. Solexa develops and commercializes genetic
    analysis technologies used to perform a range of analyses,
    including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis
    and small RNA analysis. We believe our combined company is the
    only company with genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene
    expression and sequencing, the three cornerstones of modern
    genetic analysis.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998. We
    reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal executive
    offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego,
    California 92121. Our telephone number is

(858) 202-4500.

Industry
    Background

Genetic
    Variation and Biological Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each
    parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical, or they
    may be different. These differences are referred to as genetic
    variation. Examples of the physical consequences of genetic
    variation include differences in eye and hair color. Genetic
    variation can also have important medical consequences. Genetic
    variation affects disease susceptibility, including
    predisposition to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
    Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
    cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment.
    Some people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
    still others may experience adverse side effects. A common form
    of genetic variation is a single-nucleotide polymorphism, or
    SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position in a DNA
    sequence. It is estimated that the human genome contains over
    nine million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for
    medically important effects, it is now believed that
    combinations of SNPs may contribute to the development of most
    major diseases. Since there are millions of SNPs, it is
    important to investigate many representative, well-chosen SNPs
    simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable
    information.

Another contributor to disease and dysfunction is the over- or
    under-expression of genes within an organism’s cells. A
    very complex network of genes interacts to maintain health in
    complex organisms. The challenge for scientists is to delineate
    the associated genes’ expression patterns and their
    relationship to disease. Until recently, this problem was
    addressed by investigating effects on a

gene-by-gene

basis. This is time consuming, and difficulties exist when
    several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at
    the same time. With the advent of microarray technology,
    thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time.

SNP
    Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining which base (A, C, G
    or T) is present at a particular site in the genome within
    an individual or other organism. The use of SNP genotyping to
    obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual SNP
    or a collection of SNPs, and to apply that information to
    clinical trials and diagnostic testing, requires the analysis of
    millions of SNP genotypes and the testing of large populations
    for each disease. For example, a single large clinical trial
    could involve genotyping 1,000,000 SNPs per patient in
    1,000 patients, thus requiring 1 billion assays. Using
    previously available technologies, this scale of SNP genotyping
    was both impractical and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping can be used in a variety of ways,
    including studies designed to understand the genetic
    contributions to disease (disease association studies),
    genomics-based drug development, clinical trial analysis,
    disease predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP
    genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare, for example
    in the development of plants and animals with desirable
    commercial characteristics. These markets will require billions
    of SNP genotyping assays annually.



Gene
    Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which
    genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is
    accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary messenger
    between genes (DNA) and proteins. Variation in gene expression
    can cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease
    or predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression
    patterns between cells from different environments, such as
    normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or
    absence of a drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a
    role in these processes can be identified. Studies of this type,
    often used in drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and
    preferably tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of
    samples. Once a smaller set of genes of interest has been
    identified, researchers can then examine how these genes are
    expressed or suppressed across numerous samples, for example,
    within a clinical trial.

As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases,
    gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important
    diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is
    anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the
    sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more
    cost-effective technologies.

Sequencing

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of bases
    (A, C, G or T) in a DNA sample, which can be further
    divided into de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, and tag
    sequencing. In de novo sequencing, the goal is to determine the
    sequence of a representative sample from a species never before
    sequenced. Understanding the similarities and differences in DNA
    sequence between many species can help to improve our
    understanding of the function of the structures found in the DNA.

In re-sequencing, the sequence of samples from a given species
    is determined generally comparing each to a standard or
    reference sequence. This is an extremely comprehensive form of
    genotyping, in which every single base is characterized for
    possible mutations. In tag sequencing, short sequences, each
    representative of a larger molecule or genomic location, are
    detected and counted. In these applications, the number of times
    that each tag is seen provides quantification of an underlying
    biological process. As an example, in digital gene expression,
    one tag sequence may exist for each gene, and the number of
    copies of this tag which are detected in an experiment is a
    measure of how actively that gene is being expressed in the
    tissue sample being analyzed.



Our
    Technologies

BeadArray
    Technology

We have developed a proprietary array technology that enables
    the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads
    and a substrate in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to
    produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously. Our
    BeadArray technology provides a unique combination of high
    throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility. We achieve high
    throughput with a high density of test sites per array and we
    are able to format arrays either in a pattern arranged to match
    the wells of standard microtiter plates or in various
    configurations in the format of standard microscope slides. We
    seek to maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of
    expensive reagents and valuable samples, and through the low
    manufacturing costs associated with our technologies. Our
    ability to vary the size, shape and format of the well patterns
    and to create specific bead pools, or sensors, for different
    applications provides the flexibility to address multiple
    markets and market segments. We believe that these features have
    enabled our BeadArray technology to become a leading platform
    for the emerging high-growth market of SNP genotyping and expect
    they will enable us to become a key player in the gene
    expression market.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines microwells etched
    into a substrate and specially prepared beads that self-assemble
    into an array. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two
    different array formats, the Array Matrix and the BeadChip. Our
    first bead-based product was the Array Matrix which incorporates
    fiber optic bundles. The fiber optic bundles, which we cut into
    lengths of less than one inch, are manufactured to our
    specifications. Each bundle is comprised of approximately 50,000
    individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an
    aluminum plate, which forms an Array Matrix. BeadChips are
    fabricated in microscope slide-shaped sizes with varying numbers
    of sample sites per slide. Both formats are chemically etched to
    create tens to hundreds of thousands of wells for each sample
    site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing a specific
    type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in
    a batch. We make different batches of beads, with the beads in a
    given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The
    particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function
    as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by
    attaching a particular DNA sequence, or oligo, to each bead in
    the batch. We combine batches of coated beads to form a pool
    specific to the type of array we intend to create. A bead pool
    one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce
    thousands of arrays.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact
    with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the
    wells, one bead per well. The tens of thousands of beads in the
    wells comprise our individual arrays. Because the beads assemble
    randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called
    ’decoding’ in order to determine which bead type
    occupies which well in the array. We employ several proprietary
    methods for decoding, a process that requires only a few steps
    to identify all the beads in the array. One beneficial
    by-product of the decoding process is a validation of each bead
    in the array. This quality control test characterizes the
    performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of
    any empty wells. We ensure that each bead type on the array is
    sufficiently represented by including multiple copies of each
    bead type. Multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and
    accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical
    processing of the results of identical beads. We believe we are
    the only microarray company to provide this level of quality
    control in the industry.

An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA
    from a patient, and introducing it to the array. The design
    features of our Array Matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a
    solution containing the sample, whereas our BeadChip allows
    processing of samples on a slide-sized platform. The molecules
    in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated
    bead. These molecules in either the sample or on the bead are
    labeled with a fluorescent dye either before or after the
    binding. The BeadArray Reader detects the fluorescent dye by
    shining a laser on the fiber optic bundle or on the BeadChip.
    This allows the detection of the molecules resulting in a
    quantitative analysis of the sample.



Sequencing
    Technology

Our DNA sequencing technology, acquired as part of the Solexa
    merger that was completed on January 26, 2007, is based on
    the use of our

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry. In SBS, single stranded DNA is extended from
    a priming site, one base at a time, using reversible terminator
    nucleotides. These are DNA bases which can be added to a growing
    second strand, but which initially cannot be further extended.
    This means that at each cycle of the chemistry, only one base
    can be added. Each base which is added includes a fluorescent
    label which is specific to the particular base. Thus following
    incorporation, the fluorescence can be imaged, its color
    determined, and the base itself can be inferred. Once this is
    done, an additional step removes both the fluorescence and the
    block that had prevented further extension of the second strand.
    This allows another base to be added, and the cycle can be
    repeated. We have shown data in which this cycle is repeated up
    to 50 times, thus determining DNA sequences which are up to 50
    bases long. This may well increase in the future as we further
    develop this technology. The reversible terminator bases which
    we use are novel synthetic molecules which we manufacture. They
    are not well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases, so
    we have also developed proprietary enzymes for this purpose.
    Both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant
    intellectual property.

In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on
    microscopic islands of DNA. These are called DNA clusters. Each
    cluster starts as a single DNA molecule, typically a few hundred
    bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow cell. We
    then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to create
    copies of each starting molecule. As the copies are made, they
    are covalently linked to the surface, so they cannot diffuse
    away. After a number of cycles of amplification, each cluster
    might have 500 to 1,000 copies of the original starting
    molecule, but still be only about a micron

(one-millionth

of a meter) in diameter. By making so many copies, the
    fluorescent signal from each cluster is significantly increased.
    Because the clusters are so small though, tens of millions of
    clusters can be independently formed inside a single flow cell.
    This large number of clusters can then be sequenced
    simultaneously, by alternate cycles of SBS biochemistry and
    electronic imaging.

VeraCode
    Technology

The BeadArray technology is most effective in applications which
    require mid- to high levels of multiplexing from low to high
    levels of throughput. Multiplexing refers to the number of
    individual pieces of information that are simultaneously
    extracted from one sample. We believe the molecular diagnostics
    market will require systems which are extremely high throughput
    and cost effective in the mid- to low-multiplex range. To
    address this market, we acquired the VeraCode technology through
    our acquisition of CyVera Corporation in April 2005. Based on
    digitally encoded microbeads, VeraCode enables low-cost
    multiplexing from 1 to 384-plex in a single well. We began
    shipping the BeadXpress System, which uses the VeraCode
    technology, during the first quarter of 2007, along with several
    assays for the system. We believe that this system enables lower
    multiplex genotyping, gene expression and protein based assays.
    In the research market, we expect our customers to utilize our
    BeadArray technology for their higher multiplex projects and
    then move to our BeadXpress system for their lower multiplex
    projects utilizing the same assays.

Oligator
    Technology

Genomic applications require many different short pieces of DNA
    that can be made synthetically, called oligos. We have developed
    our proprietary Oligator technology for the parallel synthesis
    of many different oligos to meet the requirements of large-scale
    genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology
    is substantially more cost effective and provides significantly
    higher throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our
    synthesis machines are computer controlled and utilize many
    robotic processes to minimize the amount of labor used in the
    manufacturing process. In 2005, we implemented our
    fourth-generation Oligator technology, which is capable of
    manufacturing over 13,000 different oligos per run. This was an
    improvement over prior generations of technology where we could
    only manufacture approximately 3,000 oligos per run. This
    increase in scale was necessary to enable us to



support the manufacture of oligos under our collaboration with
    Invitrogen as well as to support our increased internal need for
    oligos, a critical component of our BeadArray technology, for
    product sales and new product development.

Key Advantages
    of Our Technology

We believe that our technology provides distinct advantages, in
    a variety of applications, over competing technologies, by
    creating cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the
    following characteristics:

High Throughput.

The miniaturization of our
    BeadArray technology provides very high information content per
    unit area. To increase sample throughput, we have formatted our
    array matrix in a pattern arranged to match the wells of
    standard microtiter plates, allowing throughput levels of up to
    nearly 150,000 unique assays per microtiter plate, and we use
    laboratory robotics to speed process time. Similarly, we have
    patterned our whole-genome expression BeadChips to support up to
    48,000 gene expression assays for six samples with each
    BeadChip, and our whole-genome genotyping BeadChips to support
    over 1,000,000 genotypes with each BeadChip. Our Infinium and
    GoldenGate assays are supported by full automation and LIMS to
    address high throughput laboratories. Our Genome Analyzer can
    analyze the DNA sequences of tens of millions of clusters at one
    time.

Cost Effectiveness.

Our array products
    substantially reduce the cost of our customers’ experiments
    as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our
    ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances
    in fiber optics, plasma etching processes, digital imaging and
    bead chemistry. In addition, our products require smaller
    reagent volumes than other array technologies, thereby reducing
    reagent costs for our customers. Our Oligator technology further
    reduces reagent costs, as well as reducing our cost of coating
    beads used in our BeadArray and VeraCode technologies. We
    believe the Genome Analyzer allows DNA sequencing at
    1/100th of the cost of conventional capillary instruments.

Flexibility.

We are able to offer flexible
    solutions to our customers based on our ability to attach
    different kinds of molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins and
    other chemicals, to our beads. In addition, we can have
    BeadChips manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes with wells
    organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different
    markets and market segments. In combination, the use of beads
    and etched wells provides the flexibility and scalability for
    our BeadArray technology to be tailored to perform many
    applications in many different market segments, from drug
    discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology allows us to
    manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of
    oligos. DNA sequences determined with our Genome Analyzer can be
    used to identify larger DNA or RNA molecules from which the
    sequences have been derived, and can also be used for a series
    of applications based on tag sequencing, including digital gene
    expression analysis and microRNA discovery and quantification.

Quality and Reproducibility.

The quality of
    our products is dependent upon each element in the
    system — the array, the assay used to perform the
    experiment and the instrumentation and software used to capture
    the results. Each array is manufactured with a high density of
    beads, which enables us to have multiple copies of each
    individual bead type. We measure the copies simultaneously and
    combine them into one data point. This allows us to make a
    comparison of each bead against its own population of identical
    beads, which permits the statistical calculation of a more
    reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally, the
    manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step
    that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on
    every array, improving the overall quality of the data. When we
    develop the assays used with our products, we focus on
    performance, cost and ease of use. By developing assays that are
    easy to use, we can reduce the potential for the introduction of
    error into the experiment. We believe that this enables
    researchers to obtain high quality and reproducible data from
    their experiments. Additionally, we manufacture substantially
    all of the reagents used in our assays, allowing us to control
    the quality of the product delivered to the customer.



Our
    Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray, BeadXpress and Genome
    Analyzer platforms the industry standard for products and
    services addressing the genetic analysis markets. We plan to
    achieve this by:

•

focusing on emerging high-growth markets;

•

seek out new and complimentary technologies;

•

expanding our technologies into multiple product lines,
    applications and market segments; and

•

strengthening our technological leadership.

Products and
    Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray technology, the Array
    Matrix, is a disposable matrix with 96 fiber optic bundles
    arranged in a pattern that matches the standard 96-well
    microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle performs more than
    1,500 unique assays. The BeadChip, introduced in 2003, is
    fabricated in multiple configurations to support multiple
    applications and scanning technologies.

We have provided genotyping services using our proprietary
    BeadArray technology since 2001. In addition, we have developed
    our first genotyping and gene expression products based on this
    technology. These products include disposable Array Matrices and
    BeadChips, GoldenGate and Infinium reagent kits for SNP
    genotyping, BeadArray Reader scanning instruments and an
    evolving portfolio of custom and standard gene expression
    products.

SNP
    Genotyping

In 2001, we introduced the first commercial application of our
    BeadArray technology by launching our SNP genotyping services
    product line. Since this launch, we have had peak days in which
    we operated at 185 million genotypes per day. To our
    knowledge, no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable
    levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low
    cost.

We designed our first consumable BeadArray product, the Array
    Matrix, for SNP genotyping. The Array Matrix uses a universal
    format that allows it to analyze any set of SNPs. We have also
    developed reagent kits based on GoldenGate assay protocols and
    the BeadArray Reader, a laser scanner, which is used to read our
    array products.

The BeadStation, a flexible and scalable system for performing
    genotyping, was initially commercialized in late 2003. The
    system currently includes our BeadArray Reader and genotyping

and/or

gene
    expression analysis software. Depending on throughput and
    automation requirements, our customers can select the system
    configuration to best meet their needs. For production-scale
    throughput, multiple BeadStations combined with LIMS, standard
    operating procedures, and analytical software and fluid handling
    robotics can be configured to produce millions of genotypes per
    day. Scientists and researchers can perform genotyping, gene
    expression, methylation, and copy number variation (CNV)
    analysis with these products.

In 2006, we introduced several new SNP genotyping products,
    including the HumanHap family of BeadChips, for genome-wide
    disease association studies. This family of BeadChips enables
    researchers to interrogate more than 1,000,000 SNP markers for
    associated studies. We believe our BeadChips provide the most
    comprehensive genomic coverage and highest data quality of any
    whole-genome genotyping product currently available. Through an
    application called Copy Number Polymorphisms, the HumanHap
    family of BeadChips also provides high-resolution information on
    amplifications, deletions and loss of heterozygosity throughout
    the genome, abnormalities common in cancers and congenital
    diseases. In addition, we announced additional standard panels
    in the first quarter of 2006, including mouse linkage and cancer
    panels.



Also, in 2006, we began shipment of the iSelect Infinium
    genotyping product line used for focused content applications.
    With this product, customers can create a custom array of up to
    60,000 SNP markers per sample with 12 samples per chip.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, we introduced and began
    shipping the HumanHap300-Duo and the HumanHap300-Duo+ Genotyping
    BeadChips, as well as the RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip. The
    HumanHap300-Duo allows researchers to analyze two samples
    simultaneously, with over 634,000 total tag SNPs on a single
    BeadChip. The HumanHap300-Duo+ allows for the addition of 60,000
    custom SNP loci to the base product, enabling researchers to
    enrich that product with SNPs of interest in any genomic region.
    The RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip enables analysis of 12 samples
    in parallel on a single BeadChip. Content for this BeadChip is
    derived from the NCBI RefSeq database (Release 16), with over
    22,000 rat transcripts represented. By allowing for multiple
    samples on the same BeadChip, we believe we have minimized chip
    to chip variability and enhanced data quality.

In 2007, we announced the following key new product developments
    associated with SNP Genotyping:

•

Human 1M DNA Analysis BeadChip.

This product
    combines an unprecedented level of content for both whole-genome
    and CNV analysis, along with additional unique, high-value
    genomic regions of interest — all on a single
    microarray chip. Shipments of the Human 1M DNA Analysis BeadChip
    began during the second quarter of 2007.

•

HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip.

The HumanCNV370-Duo
    enables researchers to analyze two samples simultaneously and
    access novel content for detecting disease-relevant CNV regions.
    Shipments of the HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip began during the
    second quarter of 2007.

•

HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip.

The HumanHap550-Duo
    provides the same content as our HumanHap550 BeadChip in a
    dual-format, resulting in significantly greater throughput and
    lower costs per sample. The HumanHap550-Duo contains more than
    550,000 SNPs, selected based on a novel tag SNP approach.
    Shipments of the HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip began during the third
    quarter of 2007.

During 2008, we introduced two new products for DNA analysis:
    the Infinium High-Density (HD) Human1M-Duo (two samples per
    chip) and the Human610-Quad (four samples per chip), featuring
    up to 2.3 million SNPs per BeadChip. The new Infinium HD
    product line doubles sample throughput and reduces DNA input
    requirements by as much as 70 percent. The Infinium HD
    products also offer, what we believe is, enhanced signal
    discrimination and a new SNP calling algorithm. First customer
    shipments of the Human610-Quad and Human1M-Duo BeadChips are
    expected in the first and second quarter of 2008, respectively.

Gene
    Expression Profiling

With the addition of application specific accessory kits, our
    production-scale BeadStations are capable of performing a
    growing number of applications, including gene expression
    profiling.

In 2003, we introduced our focused set gene expression products
    on both the Array Matrix and BeadChip platforms. Our system
    includes a BeadArray Reader for imaging Array Matrices and
    BeadChips, a hybridization chamber and software for data
    extraction.

In 2005, we began shipment of the Human-6 and HumanRef-8
    Expression BeadChip products. Both products allow large-scale
    expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip and
    are imaged using our BeadArray Reader. The Human-6 BeadChip is
    designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome samples on
    one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately 48,000
    transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome.
    The HumanRef-8 BeadChip product analyzes eight samples in
    parallel against 24,000 transcripts from the roughly 22,000
    genes represented in the consensus RefSeq database, a
    well-characterized whole-genome subset used broadly in genetic
    analysis. We believe these gene expression BeadChips have
    dramatically reduced the cost of whole-genome



expression analysis, allowing researchers to expand the scale
    and reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation.

In 2006, we began shipment of the RatRef-12, which analyzes
    twelve samples in parallel against 22,226 transcripts from the
    roughly 21,910 genes represented in the RefSeq database, release
    16.

In 2007, we launched the next versions of the Human and Mouse
    arrays, taking advantage of the updated content of the RefSeq
    and the UniGene databases could provide. We also expanded our
    product breadth and released our first microRNA arrays for both
    human and mouse. To keep up with the ever changing needs of the
    market, we have invested in the future with new, innovative
    technologies, acquired from the Solexa acquisition, to provide
    our customers with what we believe is the broadest portfolio of
    gene expression technologies available. We believe Digital Gene
    Expression (DGE) is a revolutionary approach to expression
    analysis. Driven by sequencing technology, DGE generates
    genome-wide expression profiles through sequencing, not
    hybridization. We believe this unique method provides 100 times
    the amount of data of other methods. It can provide more than
    one billion bases of data in a single run, at 1% of the cost of
    traditional Sanger sequencing. Using DGE, researchers can:

•

quickly discover novel RNAs in any species;

•

accurately quantify low-abundance RNA;

•

confidently analyze small and non-coding RNA, as well as
    transcriptomes; and

•

independently validate microarray data.

Instrumentation

The BeadArray Reader, an instrument we developed, is a key
    component of our BeadStation. This scanning equipment uses a
    laser to read the results of experiments that are captured on
    our arrays and was designed to be used in all areas of genetic
    analysis that use our Array Matrices and BeadChips. In the
    second quarter of 2006, we began shipment of the AutoLoader,
    which automates BeadChip loading and scanning and increases lab
    throughput. The Autoloader is designed to support up to two
    BeadArray Readers simultaneously for unattended operation.

During the first quarter of 2007, we began shipment of the
    Genome Analyzer. This product can generate more than one billion
    bases of data in a single run using a massively parallel
    sequencing approach. The system leverages Solexa

sequencing-by-synthesis

technology and novel reversible terminator chemistry, optimized
    to achieve what we believe are unprecedented levels of cost
    effectiveness and throughput.

Also, during the first quarter of 2007, we began shipment of the
    BeadXpress System. This system is a high-throughput, dual-color
    laser detection system developed using the VeraCode digital
    microbead technology. It enables scanning of a broad range of
    multiplexed assays and can take researchers from biomarker
    validation and focused studies to the development of molecular
    diagnostics.

High-Throughput
    Oligo Synthesis

We have put in place a state-of-the-art oligo manufacturing
    facility. This facility serves both the commercial needs under
    our collaboration with Invitrogen and our internal needs. In
    addition to their use to coat beads, these oligos are components
    of the reagent kits for our BeadArray products and are used for
    assay development. We manufacture oligos in a wide range of
    lengths and in several scales, with the ability to add many
    types of modifications. We offer a range of quality control
    options and have implemented a laboratory information management
    system (referred to as LIMS) to control much of the
    manufacturing process. In 2005, we stopped selling oligos
    directly into the market and began shipping oligos under our
    collaboration with Invitrogen.



Our Collaborative
    Partners

deCODE
    genetics

In May 2006, we executed a Joint Development and Licensing
    Agreement (the Development Agreement) with deCODE genetics, ehf.
    (deCODE). Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the parties
    agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop, validate and
    commercialize specific diagnostic tests for variants in genes
    involved in three disease-related pathways: the gene-encoding
    leukotriene A4 hydrolase, linked to heart attack; the
    gene-encoding transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), linked to
    type 2 diabetes; and the gene-encoding BARD1, linked to breast
    cancer. With deCODE, we are developing diagnostic tests based on
    these variants for use on our BeadXpress system.

Under the agreement, we are responsible for the manufacturing,
    marketing and selling of the diagnostic products. The companies
    share the development costs of these products and split the
    profits from sales of the diagnostics tests. The Development
    Agreement may be terminated as to a particular product under
    development if one party decides to discontinue funding the
    development of that product, and may be terminated in whole by
    either party if the other party commits an uncured material
    breach, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent. Under a
    separate supply agreement, we installed instrumentation at
    deCODE that enables deCODE to perform whole genome association
    studies on up to 100,000 samples using our HumanHap300 BeadChips
    and associated reagents.

Intellectual
    Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including, as of
    February 1, 2008, ownership of, or exclusive licenses to,
    119 issued U.S. patents and 153 pending U.S. patent
    applications, including five allowed applications that have not
    yet issued as patents, some of which derive from a common parent
    application. This portfolio includes patents acquired as part of
    our acquisition of Solexa on January 26, 2007. Our issued
    patents, which are directed at various aspects of our arrays,
    assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing technology, instruments and
    chemical detection technologies, expire between 2010 and 2025.
    We are seeking to extend the patents directed at the full range
    of our technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for
    many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign
    countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright and
    trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
    innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
    our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
    ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
    processes, to preserve our trade secrets, to enforce our
    patents, copyrights and trademarks, to operate without
    infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to
    acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.

We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
    agreements and other arrangements with third parties, which
    grant us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing
    technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent
    kits and scanning equipment. We have exclusive licenses from
    Tufts University to patents that are directed at our use of
    BeadArray technology. These patents were filed by Dr. David
    Walt, a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our
    Scientific Advisory Board and one of our founders. Our exclusive
    licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents,
    which will occur between 2010 and 2020. We also have additional
    nonexclusive licenses from various third parties for other
    components of our products. In most cases, the agreements remain
    in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be
    terminated at our request without further obligation and require
    that we pay customary royalties while the agreement is in effect.

Research and
    Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
    since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
    engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
    chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
    software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
    complete the development of our products. Our research and
    development efforts have focused primarily on the



tasks required to optimize our BeadArray, Oligator, VeraCode and
    sequencing technologies and to support commercialization of the
    products and services derived from these technologies. As of
    December 30, 2007, we had a total of 277 employees
    engaged in research and development activities.

Our research and development expenses for 2007, 2006, and 2005
    (inclusive of charges relating to stock-based compensation of
    $10.0 million, $3.9 million, and $0.1 million,
    respectively) were $73.9 million, $33.4 million, and
    $27.8 million, respectively. Compared to 2007, we expect
    research and development expense to increase during 2008 as we
    continue to expand our research and product development efforts.

Marketing and
    Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
    life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving
    sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling. These
    experiments may be involved in many areas of biologic research,
    including basic human disease research, pharmaceutical drug
    discovery and development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics and
    agricultural research. Our potential customers include
    pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics and
    consumer products companies, as well as academic or private
    research centers. The genetic analysis market is relatively new
    and emerging and its size and speed of development will be
    ultimately driven by, among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and biological
    function; and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
    North America, major European markets, Japan Singapore, and
    China. In each of these areas, we have dedicated sales, service
    and application support personnel responsible for expanding and
    managing their respective customer bases. In smaller markets in
    the Pacific Rim countries and Europe, we sell our products and
    provide services to customers through distributors that
    specialize in life science products. We expect to significantly
    increase our sales and distribution resources during 2008 and
    beyond as we launch a number of new products and expand the
    number of customers that can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our array and sequencing platforms, reagent kits,
    scanning equipment and oligos. Our manufacturing capacity for
    BeadChips has increased 50% over the level as of January 1,
    2007, despite the substantial increase in complexity associated
    with manufacturing these products. We intend to continue to
    increase capacity both domestically and internationally as
    needed to manufacture our products in sufficient quantity to
    meet our business plan for 2008. We expect to continue expanding
    our manufacturing capacity in Singapore. We have signed a lease
    agreement and plan to commence manufacturing operations in the
    latter half of 2008. We are focused on continuing to enhance the
    quality and manufacturing yield of our Array Matrices and
    BeadChips and are exploring ways to continue increasing the
    level of automation in the manufacturing process. In addition,
    we have implemented information management systems for many of
    our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects
    of material and sample use. We adhere to access and safety
    standards required by federal, state and local health
    ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling and disposal
    of hazardous substances.



Competition

Although we expect that our products and services will provide
    significant advantages over products and services currently
    available from other sources, we expect to encounter intense
    competition from other companies that offer products and
    services for the SNP genotyping, gene expression and sequencing
    markets. These include companies such as Affymetrix, Agilent,
    Applera Corporation, Applied Biosystems, Beckman Coulter,
    Complete Genomics, Fluidigm, GE Corp., Luminex, Pacific
    Biosciences, Perlegen Sciences, Roche Diagnostics, Sequenom and
    Third Wave Technologies. Some of these companies have or will
    have substantially greater financial, technical, research, and
    other resources and larger, more established marketing, sales,
    distribution and service organizations than we do. In addition,
    they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets
    we need to address and in some cases a larger installed base of
    systems. Each of these markets is very competitive and we expect
    new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to
    increase. In order to effectively compete with these companies,
    we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior
    throughput, cost and accuracy advantages over the competing
    products. Rapid technological development may result in our
    products or technologies becoming obsolete. Products offered by
    us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more
    effective products based on similar or other technologies.
    Although we believe that our technology and products will offer
    advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these
    companies, we cannot assure you that we will be successful.

Segment and
    Geographic Information

We operate in one business segment for the development,
    manufacture and commercialization of tools for genetic analysis.
    Our operations are treated as one segment as we only report
    operating results on an aggregate basis to our chief operating
    decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer.

During 2007, $159.1 million, or 43%, of our total revenue
    came from shipments to customers outside the United States,
    compared to $81.5 million, or 44%, and $28.0 million,
    or 38%, in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales to territories
    outside of the United States are generally denominated in
    U.S. dollars. We expect that sales to international
    customers will continue to be an important and growing source of
    revenue. We have sales support resources in Western Europe and
    direct sales offices in Japan, Singapore and China. In addition,
    we have distributor relationships in various countries in the
    Pacific Rim region and Europe. See Note 13 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
    concerning our foreign and domestic operations.

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
    significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
    is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
    highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as academic
    customers spend unused budget allocations before the end of the
    government’s fiscal year.

Environmental
    Matters

We are dedicated to the protection of our employees and the
    environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
    materials which subject us to a variety of federal, state and
    local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
    we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and
    regulations; however, we could be held liable for damages and
    fines should contamination of the environment or individual
    exposures to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we cannot
    predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the
    development of new laws and regulations, will affect our
    business operations or the cost of compliance.

During 2007, we entered into a lease agreement with BioMed
    Realty Trust, Inc. to expand into a new office building in
    San Diego, California. This new building will be LEED
    certified.



Employees

As of December 30, 2007, we had a total of
    1,041 employees, 195 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees.
    Ninety-seven of our employees with Ph.D. degrees are engaged in
    full-time research and development activities. None of our
    employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our
    employee relations to be positive.

    Company’s Chief Operating Officer since January 2005 and a
    Director since April 1998. From April 1998 to October 1999, he
    served as acting President and Chief Executive Officer and from
    April 1998 to April 2000 as acting Chief Financial Officer.
    Between October 1999 and January 2005, Dr. Stuelpnagel was
    Vice President of Business Development and later as Senior Vice
    President of Operations. While founding Illumina,
    Dr. Stuelpnagel was an associate with CW Group, a venture
    capital firm. Dr. Stuelpnagel received both a bachelor of
    science degree in biochemistry and a doctorate degree in
    veterinary medicine from the University of California (Davis,
    CA), and went on to receive a master of business administration
    degree from the University of California, Los Angeles.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
    described below. In addition to the other information included
    in this

Form 10-K,

the following issues could adversely affect our operating
    results or our stock price.

We expect
    intense competition in our target markets, which could render
    our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This
    would limit our ability to compete and maintain profitability.
    If we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new
    products, our revenue may not grow as intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture
    and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function and other applications using technologies
    such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary
    electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
    microfluidics, nanotechnology, next-generation DNA sequencing
    and mechanically deposited, inkjet and photolithographic arrays.
    We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the
    future as existing companies develop new or improved products
    and as new companies enter the market with new technologies. The
    markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing
    technology, evolving industry standards, changes in customer
    needs, emerging competition, new product introductions and
    strong price competition. For example, prices per data point for
    genotyping have fallen significantly over the last two years and
    we anticipate that prices will continue to fall. One or more of
    our competitors may render our technology obsolete or
    uneconomical. Some of our competitors have greater financial and
    personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established
    customer base and more experience in research and development
    than we do. Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical
    companies, which are our potential customers and strategic
    partners, could develop competing products. For example, during
    the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied Biosystems Group, a
    business segment of Applera Corporation, launched the
    SOLID

tm

System

,

its next generation sequencing technology.
    If we are unable



to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new
    product offerings, our business, financial condition and results
    of operations will suffer.

Our
    manufacturing capacity may limit our ability to sell our
    products.

We continue to ramp up our capacity to meet the anticipated
    demand for our products. Although we have significantly
    increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have
    plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to
    meet our business plan in 2008 and 2009, there are uncertainties
    inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may
    not be able to increase our capacity in a timely manner. For
    example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as
    we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and
    launch new products. As a result, we may experience difficulties
    in meeting customer, collaborator and internal demand, in which
    case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product
    introductions, and demand for our products could decline.
    Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in
    manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced
    production yields. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing
    products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or
    previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that
    could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability
    to launch or sell these products, or to produce them
    economically, prevent us from achieving expected performance
    levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by
    customers.

We may
    encounter difficulties in managing our growth. These
    difficulties could impair our profitability.

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid
    and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans,
    which will place a strain on our human and capital resources. If
    we are unable to manage this growth effectively, our
    profitability could suffer. Our ability to manage our operations
    and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds
    to enhance our operational, financial and management controls,
    reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain
    sufficient numbers of talented employees. If we are unable to
    scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process
    and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we
    encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we
    will not be able to make available the products required to
    successfully commercialize our technology. Failure to attract
    and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further
    strain our human resources and could impede our growth.

If we lose our
    key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional
    personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
    personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief
    executive officer. The loss of their services could adversely
    impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We will
    need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in
    molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing,
    sales, marketing and technical support. We compete for qualified
    management and scientific personnel with other life science
    companies, universities and research institutions, particularly
    those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals,
    particularly in the San Diego and San Francisco area,
    is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. Failure to
    attract and retain management and scientific personnel would
    prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our
    products or technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional expertise in
    specific industries and areas applicable to the products
    developed through our technologies, including the life sciences
    and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add new
    personnel, including management, and develop the expertise of
    existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
    growth of our business.



If we are
    unable to develop and maintain operation of our manufacturing
    capability, we may not be able to launch or support our products
    in a timely manner, or at all.

We currently manufacture in a limited number of locations. Our
    manufacturing facilities are located in San Diego and
    Hayward, California and Little Chesterford, United Kingdom. We
    are in the process of expanding our manufacturing operations
    into Singapore, a country in which we have no past manufacturing
    experience. These areas are subject to natural disasters such as
    earthquakes or floods. If a natural disaster were to
    significantly damage one of our facilities or if other events
    were to cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent
    us from developing and manufacturing our products and services.

Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are
    controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS). Additionally, as part of the decoding
    step in our array manufacturing process, we record several
    images of each array to identify what bead is in each location
    on the array and to validate each bead in the array. This
    requires significant network and storage infrastructure. If
    either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure
    were to fail for an extended period of time, it may adversely
    impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis
    and would prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in
    any given period.

Our sales,
    marketing and technical support organization may limit our
    ability to sell our products.

We currently have fewer resources available for sales and
    marketing and technical support services compared to some of our
    primary competitors. In order to effectively commercialize our
    sequencing, genotyping and gene expression systems and other
    products to follow, we will need to expand our sales, marketing
    and technical support staff both domestically and
    internationally. We may not be successful in establishing or
    maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution
    arrangements to market our products and services. In addition,
    we compete primarily with much larger companies that have larger
    sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base
    of products in place, and the efforts from a limited sales and
    marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market
    acceptance of our products required to support continued growth
    of our business.

Negative
    conditions in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity
    of a portion of our investment portfolio.

Our investment securities consist of U.S. dollar-based
    short maturity mutual funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds,
    treasury notes, auction rate securities and municipal bonds. As
    of December 30, 2007, our short-term investments included
    $14.7 million of high-grade (AAA rated) auction rate
    securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities.
    The recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have
    prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings,
    including their holdings of auction rate securities. In February
    2008, we were informed that there was insufficient demand at
    auction for four of our high-grade auction rate securities,
    representing approximately $10.7 million. As a result,
    these affected securities are currently not liquid, and we could
    be required to hold them until they are redeemed by the issuer
    or to maturity. We may experience a similar situation with our
    remaining auction rate securities. In the event we need to
    access the funds that are in an illiquid state, we will not be
    able to do so without a loss of principal, until a future
    auction on these investments is successful, the securities are
    redeemed by the issuer or they mature. At this time, management
    has not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these
    investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the
    short term, although the market for these investments is
    presently uncertain. If the credit ratings of the security
    issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is
    determined to be other-than-temporary, we would adjust the
    carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge.



We may
    encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions that could
    adversely affect our business, specifically the effective launch
    and customer acceptance of new technology
    platforms.

We acquired Solexa in January 2007 and CyVera in April 2005 and
    we may in the future acquire technology, products or businesses
    related to our current or future business. We have limited
    experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote
    substantial time and resources in order to complete
    acquisitions. Further, these potential acquisitions entail
    risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business.
    For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate a
    company’s operations, technologies, products and services,
    information systems and personnel into our business. An
    acquisition may further strain our existing financial and
    managerial resources, and divert management’s attention
    away from our other business concerns.

In connection with these acquisitions, we assumed certain
    liabilities and hired certain employees, which is expected to
    continue to result in an increase in our research and
    development expenses and capital expenditures. There may also be
    unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an
    acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results.
    To finance any acquisitions, we may choose to issue shares of
    our common stock as consideration, which could result in
    dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, an acquisition may
    have a substantial negative impact on near-term expected
    financial results.

The success of the Solexa acquisition depends, in part, on our
    ability to realize the anticipated synergies, growth
    opportunities and cost savings from integrating Solexa’s
    businesses with our businesses. Our success in realizing these
    benefits and the timing of this realization depends upon the
    continued successful integration of the operations of Solexa.
    The integration of two independent companies is a complex,
    costly and time-consuming process. In addition, Solexa continues
    to operate at separate sites. Geographic integration in whole or
    in part could result in the loss of key employees, diversion of
    each company’s management’s attention, the disruption
    or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each
    company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in
    standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could
    adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with
    customers and employees or our ability to achieve the
    anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or could reduce our
    earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and
    financial results of the combined company.

The combined
    company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the
    acquisition as a result of our failure to achieve anticipated
    revenue growth following the acquisition.

For various reasons, including significant competition, low
    market acceptance or market growth, and lack of technology
    advantage, revenue recognized from the Solexa acquisition may
    not grow as anticipated and if so, we may not realize the
    expected value from this transaction.

If we are
    unable to find third-party manufacturers to manufacture
    components of our products, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

The nature of our products requires customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. For
    example, we currently use multiple components in our products
    that are single-sourced. If we are unable to secure a sufficient
    supply of those or other product components, we will be unable
    to meet demand for our products. We may need to enter into
    contractual relationships with manufacturers for
    commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop
    these capabilities internally, and we cannot assure you that we
    will be able to do this on a timely basis, for sufficient
    quantities or on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we
    may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume
    manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs.

Changes in our
    effective income tax rate could impact our
    profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on
    interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required
    in



determining the provision for income taxes. Our effective income
    tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors
    including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in
    tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
    existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of
    non-deductible expenses including share-based compensation,
    changes in our future levels of research and development
    spending, mergers and acquisitions, and the result of
    examinations by various tax authorities.

Any inability
    to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm
    our competitive position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents
    and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in
    the United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
    intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
    our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
    The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
    rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
    many companies have encountered significant challenges in
    protecting their proprietary rights abroad. These challenges can
    be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the
    establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights
    abroad.

The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries, including our patent
    position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and
    factual questions. We will be able to protect our proprietary
    rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent
    that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and
    enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade
    secrets. We intend to apply for patents covering our
    technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However, our
    patent applications may be challenged and may not result in
    issued patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after
    they are issued. Questions as to inventorship may also arise.
    Any finding that our patents and applications are unenforceable
    could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the
    related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship
    rights to our patents and applications could require us to
    obtain certain rights to practice related technologies, which
    may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we
    obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
    practicing our technologies or from developing competing
    products. There also is risk that others may independently
    develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
    patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us
    with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate
    additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or
    litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive
    and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual
    property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the
    marketplace. Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the
    attention of our management and technical personnel.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential
    and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to
    protect our confidential information. These measures, however,
    may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or
    other confidential information. Among other things, we seek to
    protect our trade secrets and confidential information by
    entering into confidentiality agreements with employees,
    collaborators and consultants. Nevertheless, employees,
    collaborators or consultants may still disclose our confidential
    information, and we may not otherwise be able to effectively
    protect our trade secrets. Accordingly, others may gain access
    to our confidential information, or may independently develop
    substantially equivalent information or techniques.

Litigation or
    other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property
    infringement could require us to spend significant time and
    money and could prevent us from selling our products or services
    or impact our stock price.

Our commercial success depends, in part, on our non-infringement
    of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and on our
    ability to protect our own intellectual property. Third parties
    have asserted or may assert that we are employing their
    proprietary technology without authorization. As we



enter new markets, we expect that competitors will likely assert
    that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as
    part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into
    those markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and
    may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the
    use of our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur
    substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these
    claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in
    defending ourselves against these claims could have a material
    adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate
    to the actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties
    making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or
    other relief, which effectively could block our ability to
    develop further, commercialize and sell products, and could
    result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the
    event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may
    be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from
    third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products.
    In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a
    reasonable cost, if at all. We could therefore incur substantial
    costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from
    third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins.
    In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions
    while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.
    Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these
    licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from
    commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of
    our products could materially affect our ability to grow and
    maintain profitability.

We have a
    significant amount of indebtedness. We may not be able to make
    payments on our indebtedness, and we may incur additional
    indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our
    operation and profitability.

In February 2007, we issued $400 million of
    0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due February 2014. The
    notes bear interest semi-annually, mature on February 15,
    2014 and obligate us to repurchase the notes at the option of
    the holders if a “designated event” (as defined in the
    indenture for the notes), such as certain merger transactions
    involving us, occurs. In addition, upon conversion of the notes,
    we must pay in cash the principal portion of the notes being
    converted. Our ability to make payments on the notes will depend
    on our future operating performance and our ability to generate
    cash and may also depend on our ability to obtain additional
    debt or equity financing. We may need to use our cash to pay
    principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds
    available to fund our research and development programs,
    strategic initiatives and working capital requirements. Our
    ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service
    the notes and fund our operating requirements will depend on our
    continued ability to commercialize new products and expand our
    manufacturing capabilities. Our debt service obligations
    increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures, because
    our competitors may be less leveraged than we are. If we are
    unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow to service our
    indebtedness and fund our operating requirements, we may be
    forced to reduce our development programs or seek additional
    debt or equity financing, which may not be available to us on
    satisfactory terms, or at all, or may dilute the interests of
    our existing stockholders. Our level of indebtedness may make us
    more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns. If we incur
    new indebtedness, the risks relating to our business and our
    ability to service our indebtedness will intensify.

We expect that
    our results of operations will fluctuate. This fluctuation could
    cause our stock price to decline.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and services projects, the impact
    of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Given the
    difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for
    our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter
    fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a
    sequential decline in quarterly revenue. A large portion of our
    expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for
    facilities, equipment and personnel. In addition, we expect
    operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in
    absolute dollars. Accordingly, if revenue does not grow as
    anticipated, we may not be able to maintain annual
    profitability. Any significant



delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable
    sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the
    other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future
    revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly
    revenue. Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue
    and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our
    operating results are not a good indication of our future
    performance. If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet
    the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our
    stock price could decline.

We have only
    recently achieved annual operating profitability.

Prior to 2006, we had incurred net losses each year since our
    inception, and in 2007 we reported a net loss of
    $278.4 million, reflecting significant charges associated
    with our acquisition of Solexa in January 2007 and the
    settlement of our litigation with Affymetrix. As of
    December 30, 2007, our accumulated deficit was
    $383.0 million. Our ability to regain and sustain annual
    profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if
    any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses. Non-cash
    stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to our
    acquisition of Solexa are also likely to continue to adversely
    affect our future profitability. We expect to continue incurring
    significant expenses related to research and development, sales
    and marketing efforts to commercialize our products and the
    continued development of our manufacturing capabilities. In
    addition, we expect that our research and development and
    selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in
    the future as a result of the development and launch of new
    products. Even if we regain profitability, we may not be able to
    increase profitability on a quarterly basis.

A significant
    portion of our sales are to international
    customers.

Approximately 43%, 44% and 38% of our revenue for the years
    ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006, respectively, was derived from shipments
    to customers outside the United States. We intend to continue to
    expand our international presence and export sales to
    international customers and we expect the total amount of

non-U.S. sales

to continue to grow. Export sales entail a variety of risks,
    including:

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of
    foreign countries into which we import our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other
    trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety
    of foreign laws.

In addition, sales to international customers typically result
    in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts
    receivable collection. We are also subject to general
    geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic
    instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. One
    or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and operating results.

Our success
    depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for
    analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
    sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The usefulness of our
    technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data
    and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease. We are
    focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function, namely sequencing, SNP genotyping and gene
    expression profiling. These markets are new and emerging, and
    they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their
    full potential. Other methods of analysis of genetic variation
    and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we
    are developing. Also, researchers may not seek or be able to
    convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information
    through the analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function. In



addition, factors affecting research and development spending
    generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment
    affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and
    changes in government programs that provide funding to companies
    and research institutions, could harm our business. If useful
    genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not
    develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at
    a slower rate than we expect, and we may not be able to sustain
    annual profitability.

The accounting
    method for our convertible debt securities may be subject to
    change.

A convertible debt security providing for share

and/or

cash
    settlement of the conversion value and meeting specified
    requirements under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue

No. 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
    and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock

,
    including our outstanding convertible debt securities, is
    currently classified in its entirety as debt under
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. No portion
    of the carrying value of such a security related to the
    conversion option indexed to the issuer’s stock is
    classified as equity. In addition, interest expense is
    recognized at the stated coupon rate. The coupon rate of
    interest for convertible debt securities, including our
    convertible debt securities, is typically lower than an issuer
    would be required to pay for nonconvertible debt with otherwise
    similar terms.

The EITF recently considered whether the accounting for cash
    settled convertible debt securities, which are convertible debt
    securities that require or permit settlement in cash either in
    whole or in part upon conversion should be changed, but was
    unable to reach a consensus and discontinued deliberations on
    this issue. Subsequently, in July 2007, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) voted unanimously to reconsider the
    current accounting for cash settled convertible debt securities,
    which includes our convertible debt securities. In August 2007,
    the FASB exposed for public comment a proposed FASB Staff
    Position (FSP) that would change the method of accounting for
    such securities and would require the proposed method to be
    retrospectively applied. The FASB began its redeliberations of
    the guidance in that proposed FSP in January 2008. The FSP, if
    issued as proposed, would likely become effective for companies
    like us in the first quarter of 2009. Under this proposed method
    of accounting, the debt and equity components of our convertible
    debt securities would be bifurcated and accounted for separately
    in a manner that would result in recognizing interest on these
    securities at effective rates more comparable to what we would
    have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise
    similar terms. The equity component of our convertible debt
    securities would be included in the

paid-in-capital

section of stockholders’ equity on our balance sheet and,
    accordingly, the initial carrying values of these debt
    securities would be reduced. Our net income for financial
    reporting purposes would be reduced by recognizing the accretion
    of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt
    securities to their face amounts as additional non-cash interest
    expense. Therefore, if the proposed method of accounting for
    cash settled convertible debt securities is adopted by the FASB
    as described above, it would have an adverse impact on our past
    and future reported financial results. As the final guidance has
    not been issued, we cannot predict its ultimate outcome.

We also cannot predict any other changes in GAAP that may be
    made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities, some
    of which could have an adverse impact on our past or future
    reported financial results.

Additionally, on February 14, 2007, we entered into a lease
    agreement with BioMed Realty Trust, Inc. (BioMed) to expand into
    a new office building BioMed intends to build in San Diego,
    California. The new building will be used for research and
    development, manufacturing and administrative purposes. The
    lease covers approximately 84,000 square feet, which is to
    be occupied in three phases, the first of which is expected to
    be occupied by October 1, 2008. The lease expires
    15 years from the date the first phase is occupied, subject
    to our right to extend the term for up to three additional
    five-year periods.

On October 3, 2007, we entered into a lease agreement with
    The Irvine Company, LLC (Irvine) to expand our manufacturing
    operations into an additional San Diego facility. The lease
    commences on March 1, 2008 and covers approximately
    51,900 square feet. The lease expires in March 2015,
    subject to our right to extend the term for an additional
    five-year period.

On October 24, 2007, we also leased a manufacturing
    facility in Singapore that covers approximately
    32,800 square feet. The lease commences on March 15,
    2008 and is for a term of five years with the option to renew
    for an additional five-year period.

In February 2008, we agreed to lease an additional facility in
    Little Chesterford, United Kingdom that is in the process of
    being constructed for research and development, manufacturing
    and administrative purposes. This facility covers approximately
    41,500 square feet. We expect to occupy this new building
    by the end of 2009.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In the recent past, we incurred substantial costs in defending
    ourselves against patent infringement claims and expect, going
    forward, to devote substantial financial and managerial
    resources to protect our intellectual property and to defend
    against any future claims asserted against us.

Affymetrix
    Litigation

On January 9, 2008, we resolved all our outstanding
    litigations with Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix) by entering into
    a settlement agreement in which we agreed, without admitting
    liability, to make a one-time payment to Affymetrix of
    $90.0 million. In return, Affymetrix agreed to dismiss with
    prejudice all lawsuits it had brought against us, and we agreed
    to dismiss with prejudice our counterclaims in the relevant
    lawsuits. In exchange for the payment, Affymetrix agreed not to
    sue us or our affiliates or customers for making, using or
    selling any of our current products, evolutions of those
    products or services related to



those products. In addition, Affymetrix agreed that, for four
    years, it will not sue us for making, using or selling our
    products or services that are based on future technology
    developments. The covenant not to sue covers all fields other
    than photolithography, the process by which Affymetrix
    manufactures its arrays and a field in which we do not operate.

The January 2008 settlement resolved complaints Affymetrix had
    previously filed in the U.S. and abroad. Specifically, on
    July 26, 2004, Affymetrix had filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
    that the use, manufacture and sale of our BeadArray products and
    services, including our Array Matrix and BeadChip products,
    infringe six Affymetrix patents. At that time Affymetrix was
    also seeking an injunction against the sale of any products that
    would ultimately be determined to infringe these patents,
    unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys’ fees.
    Subsequently, on October 24, 2007, Affymetrix had filed
    complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Delaware, in Regional Court in Düsseldorf (Germany), and in
    the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division — Patents
    Court in London (United Kingdom) alleging that the use,
    manufacture and sale of certain of our BeadArray products and
    services, including our Array Matrix and BeadChip products,
    infringe three U.S. patents and three European patents of
    Affymetrix. In its U.S. complaint filed in 2007, Affymetrix
    had also alleged that our sequencing technology, including the
    Genome Analyzer, infringes two Affymetrix U.S. patents.
    Affymetrix also sought an injunction against the sale of any
    products that would ultimately be determined to infringe these
    patents, unspecified monetary damages, interest and
    attorneys’ fees.

Former
    Employee Claim

On June 15, 2005, a former employee, filed suit against us
    in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
    seeking an order requiring us and the U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office to correct the inventorship of certain of our
    patents and patent applications by adding the former employee as
    an inventor, alleging that we committed inequitable conduct and
    fraud in not naming him as an inventor, and seeking a judgment
    declaring certain of our patents and patent applications
    unenforceable, unspecified monetary damages and attorney’s
    fees. On January 30, 2008, this dispute was resolved to the
    mutual satisfaction of the parties by entering into a release
    and settlement agreement pursuant to which all claims pending in
    that litigation were dismissed with prejudice.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of
    Applera Corporation (Applied Biosystems) filed suit in
    California Superior Court, Santa Clara County against
    Solexa (which we acquired on January 26, 2007). This State
    Court action is about the ownership of several patents assigned
    in 1995 to Solexa’s predecessor company (Lynx Therapeutics)
    by a former employee (Dr. Stephen Macevicz) who is the
    inventor of these patents and is named as a co-defendant in the
    suit. Lynx was originally a unit of Applied Biosystems but was
    spun out in 1992. On May 31, 2007, Applied Biosystems filed
    a second suit, this time against us, in the U.S. District
    Court for the Northern District of California. This second suit
    seeks a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of the Macevicz
    patents that are the subject of the State Court action mentioned
    above. Both suits were later consolidated in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
    California, San Francisco Division.

The Macevicz patents relate to methods for sequencing DNA using
    successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe ligation

(Sequencing-by-Ligation).

Our Genome Analyzer system uses a different technology called
    DNA

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which is not covered by any of these patents. In
    addition, the sequencing technology originally used by Lynx
    Therapeutics (called
    “MPSS

tm

”)
    is not based on the methods covered by the Macevicz patents. In
    any event, we have never used
    MPSS

tm

in our sequencing platform. Furthermore, we have no plans to use
    any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by these patents. By these consolidated
    actions Applied Biosytems is seeking ownership of the Macevicz
    patents, unspecified costs and damages, and a declaration of
    non-infringement of these patents. Applied Biosystems is not
    asserting any claim for patent infringement against us.

    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock has been quoted on The NASDAQ Global Select
    Market under the symbol “ILMN” since July 28,
    2000. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our
    common stock. The following table sets forth, for the periods
    indicated, the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of
    our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global Select Market.
    Our present policy is to retain earnings, if any, to finance
    future growth. We have never paid cash dividends and have no
    present intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable
    future. In addition, the indenture for our convertible senior
    notes due 2014, which are convertible into cash and, in certain
    circumstances, shares of our common stock, requires us to
    increase the conversion rate applicable to the notes if we pay
    any cash dividends.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operation.

The following discussion and analysis should be read with
    “Item 6. Selected Financial Data” and our
    consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
    uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives,
    expectations and intentions. Words such as
    “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “may,” “plan,”
    “potential,” “predict,” “project”
    or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words,
    may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of
    these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not
    forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include,
    among others, statements regarding the integration of
    Solexa’s and CyVera’s technology with our existing
    technology, the commercial launch of new products, including
    products based on Solexa’s and CyVera’s technology,
    and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is
    expected to fund our operating activities.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown
    risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate
    assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those expected or implied by the forward looking
    statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these
    differences include those discussed in “Item 1A. Risk
    Factors” as well as those discussed elsewhere. The risk
    factors and other cautionary statements made in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

should be read as applying to all related forward-looking
    statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
    integrated systems for the large scale analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function. Using our proprietary
    technologies, we provide a comprehensive line of products and
    services that currently serve the sequencing, genotyping and
    gene expression markets. In the future, we expect to enter the
    market for molecular diagnostics. Our customers include leading
    genomic research centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic
    institutions, clinical research organizations and biotechnology
    companies. Our tools provide researchers around the world with
    the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
    necessary to perform the billions of genetic tests needed to
    extract valuable medical information from advances in genomics
    and proteomics. We believe this information will enable
    researchers to correlate genetic variation and biological
    function, which will enhance drug discovery and clinical
    research, allow diseases to be detected earlier and permit
    better choices of drugs for individual patients.

In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of CyVera. The
    aggregate consideration for the transaction was
    $14.5 million, consisting of approximately 1.5 million
    shares of our common stock and payment of approximately
    $2.3 million of CyVera’s liabilities at the closing.

On January 26, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Solexa
    for approximately 13.1 million shares of our common stock.
    Solexa develops and commercializes genetic analysis technologies
    used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome
    resequencing, gene expressing analysis and small RNA analysis.
    We believe our combined company is the only company with
    genome-scale technology for genotyping, gene expression and
    sequencing, the three cornerstones of modern genetic analysis.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and service projects, the impact of
    seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research
    projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending
    levels in the life science industry and other unpredictable
    factors that may affect our customer ordering patterns. Any
    significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay
    of commercial acceptance of new products, unfavorable sales
    trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other
    factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue
    growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue. Due
    to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income
    or loss, we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating
    results are not a good indication of our future performance.



As of December 30, 2007, our accumulated deficit was
    $383.0 million and total stockholders’ equity was
    $411.7 million. Our losses have principally occurred as a
    result of acquired in-process research and development charges
    of $303.4 million related to our acquisition of Solexa in
    2007, the substantial resources required for the research,
    development and manufacturing

scale-up

effort required to commercialize our products and services, a
    charge of $54.5 million in 2007 primarily related to
    settlement of our litigation with Affymetrix and
    $15.8 million related to our acquisition of CyVera in 2005.
    We expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research,
    development and manufacturing

scale-up

activities over the next several years. We will also need to
    increase our selling, general and administrative costs as we
    build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and
    support the sale of systems, other products and services.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
    results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
    statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
    preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates, assumptions and judgments with respect to the
    application of accounting policies that affect the reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
    to our consolidated financial statements. Certain accounting
    policies are deemed critical if 1) they require an
    accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that were
    highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and
    2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to
    occur, or different estimates that we reasonably could have used
    would have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Management has discussed the development and selection of these
    critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our
    Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
    disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our
    financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed
    critical as defined above.

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect
    our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the
    preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and
    services. Product revenue consists of sales of arrays, reagents,
    flow cells, instrumentation and oligos. Service and other
    revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping
    and sequencing services, extended warranty sales and amounts
    earned under research agreements with government grants, which
    is recognized in the period during which the related costs are
    incurred.

We recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines
    established by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104.
    Under SAB No. 104, revenue cannot be recorded until
    all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have
    been rendered; the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. All
    revenue is recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns
    or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    Revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized
    when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping and
    sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer.



In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based
    on future performance or a right of return exists, we defer
    revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed and
    determinable. We assess collectibility based on a number of
    factors, including past transaction history with the customer
    and the creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.
    Changes in judgments and estimates regarding application of
    SAB No. 104 might result in a change in the timing or
    amount of revenue recognized.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. We also sell separately priced maintenance (extended
    warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or two years,
    upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for
    extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
    the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an increase in
    warranty claims or if costs of servicing our warrantied products
    were greater than our estimates, gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

While the majority of our sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, we do enter into agreements that contain
    multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    Significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to
    determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the
    deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should
    be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue
    recognition purposes, and if so, how the price should be
    allocated among the deliverable elements, when to recognize
    revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue
    should be recognized. We recognize revenue for delivered
    elements only when we determine that the fair values of
    undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties
    regarding customer acceptance.

Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
    required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
    regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
    receivables are outstanding and review historical loss rates. If
    the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
    additional allowances could be required.

Inventory
    Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
    obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
    realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
    market conditions and the release of new products that will
    supercede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
    obsolete products and components, taking into account product
    life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality
    issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels.
    If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated,
    additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
    intellectual property matters. Based on the information
    available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation
    with our legal counsel, we assess the likelihood of any adverse
    judgments or outcomes of these matters, as well as the potential
    ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably
    estimable, we will record a liability in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.



Goodwill and
    Intangible Asset Valuation

Our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair
    value of net assets acquired from our Solexa and Cyvera
    acquisitions. Our intangible assets are comprised primarily of
    acquired technology and customer relationships from the
    acquisition of Solexa and licensed technology from the
    Affymetrix settlement. We make significant judgments in relation
    to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting
    from (i) acquisitions; and (ii) litigation settlements.

In determining the carrying amount of our goodwill and
    intangible assets arising from acquisitions, we used the
    purchase method of accounting. The purchase method of accounting
    requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to
    allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net
    tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process
    research and development (IPR&D). Goodwill and intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but
    are subject to at least annual impairment tests. The amounts and
    useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact
    future amortization, and the amount assigned to IPR&D is
    expensed immediately.

Determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible
    assets acquired as part of litigation settlements also requires
    the exercise of judgment. While there are a number of different
    generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of
    intangible assets, we used the discounted cash flow method in
    determining the value of licensed technology associated with the
    settlement of our Affymetrix litigation. This method required
    significant management judgment to forecast the future operating
    results used in the analysis. In addition, other significant
    estimates were required such as residual growth rates and
    discount factors. The estimates we used to value and amortize
    intangible assets were consistent with the plans and estimates
    that we use to manage our business and based on available
    historical information and industry estimates and averages.
    These judgments can significantly affect our net operating
    results. In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis to
    determine the effect a change in revenue projections of 10%
    would have on our intangible asset, noting the impact would be a
    reduction or increase in the value of the intangible asset of
    $2.0 million.

SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,

requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be
    assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques.
    If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure
    the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The goodwill
    impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as in a business combination. Determining the fair value
    of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often
    involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These
    estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on
    whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the
    magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market
    comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and
    assumptions, including projection and timing of future cash
    flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future
    cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate
    market comparables, and determination of whether a premium or
    discount should be applied to comparables. It is reasonably
    possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets
    may be incorrect. If our actual results, or the plans and
    estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the
    original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these
    assets, we could incur additional impairment charges. We have
    performed our annual test of goodwill as of May 1, 2007,
    noting no impairment, and have determined there has been no
    impairment of goodwill through December 30, 2007.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment.

Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation
    cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s
    fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)
    option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly
    judgmental assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates,
    and expected option life. If any of



these assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly,
    stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the
    future from that recorded in the current period.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence. As of December 30, 2007, we
    have maintained a valuation allowance only against certain
    U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have
    not met the “more likely than not” threshold required
    under SFAS No. 109.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recognize
    excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation to
    stockholders’ equity only when realized. When assessing
    whether excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation
    have been realized, we follow the

with-and-without

approach, excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires that we
    recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income
    tax expense.

Total revenue for the years ended December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006 was $366.8 million and
    $184.6 million, respectively. This represents an increase
    of $182.2 million for 2007, or 99%, compared to 2006.

Product revenue increased to $326.7 million for the year
    ended December 30, 2007 from $155.8 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Consumable products and
    instruments



constituted 59% and 37% of product revenue for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, respectively, compared to 64% and 28%
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. The
    change in sales associated with our product mix is due to
    increased sales in instruments primarily attributable to the
    Genome Analyzer, which was introduced during the first quarter
    of 2007. Growth in consumable revenue was primarily attributable
    to strong demand for our Infinium products. We expect to see
    continued growth in product revenue, which can be mainly
    attributed to the launch of several new products, sales of
    existing products and the growth of our installed base of
    instruments.

Service and other revenue increased to $40.1 million for
    the year ended December 30, 2007 from $28.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006. Service and other
    revenue includes revenue generated from genotyping and
    sequencing service contracts and extended warranty contracts. In
    2007, service and other revenue also includes research revenue.
    Historically, research revenue was included in a separate line
    item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The increase
    in service and other revenue is primarily due to the completion
    of several significant Infinium and iSelect custom SNP
    genotyping service contracts and sequencing services contracts.
    We expect sales from SNP genotyping and sequencing services
    contracts to fluctuate on a yearly and quarterly basis,
    depending on the mix and number of contracts that are completed.
    The timing of completion of SNP genotyping and sequencing
    services contracts are highly dependent on the customers’
    schedules for delivering the SNPs and samples to us.

Cost of product and service and other revenue represents
    manufacturing costs incurred in the production process,
    including component materials, assembly labor and overhead,
    installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as
    costs associated with performing genotyping and sequencing
    services on behalf of our customers. Cost of product revenue
    increased to $120.0 million for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, compared to $51.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, primarily driven by higher
    consumable and instrument sales. Cost of product revenue for the
    years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006
    included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of
    $4.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Gross
    margin on product revenue decreased to 63.3% for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, compared to 67.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The decrease in the gross margin
    percentage is primarily due to the shift in product mix towards
    instruments. In addition, the gross margin percentage was
    adversely impacted by the increase in non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense as well as $0.7 million associated
    with the amortization of inventory revaluation costs related to
    our acquisition of Solexa in January 2007. The impact of
    non-cash stock-based compensation charges decreased our gross
    margin by 41 basis points for the year ended
    December 30, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The inventory revaluation costs
    decreased our gross margin by 24 basis points for the year
    ended December 30, 2007, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Cost of service and other revenue increased to
    $12.4 million for the year ended December 30, 2007,
    compared to $8.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher service revenue.
    Gross margin on service and other revenue decreased to 69.0% for
    the year ended December 30, 2007, compared to 71.9% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the gross
    margin percentage is primarily driven by unfavorable product mix.



We expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross
    margins. We expect price competition to continue in our market,
    and our margins may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to
    quarter as a result.

    testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research
    and development expenses as they are incurred.

Research and development expenses increased to
    $73.9 million for the year ended December 30, 2007,
    compared to $33.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Research and development expenses as a
    percentage of total revenue were 20.2% for the year ended
    December 30, 2007, compared to 18.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Approximately $27.0 million of the
    increase for the year ended December 30, 2007 was due to
    higher research and development expenses associated with our
    acquisition of Solexa in January 2007. Costs to support our
    BeadArray technology research activities increased approximately
    $8.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2007,
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due
    to an overall increase in personnel-related expenses and
    increased lab and material expenses. Several new Infinium chip
    products, including the Human 1M DNA Analysis BeadChip,
    HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip and HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip, have been
    introduced to the market in 2007. In addition, non-cash
    stock-based compensation expense increased approximately
    $6.1 million compared to the year ended December 31,
    2006. These increases were partially offset by a
    $1.0 million decrease in research and development expenses
    related to the VeraCode technology, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. We began shipping our BeadXpress System,
    which is based on our VeraCode technology, during the first
    quarter of 2007. As a result of completing the development of
    this product, the related research and development expenses have
    decreased.

We believe a substantial investment in research and development
    is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into
    additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and
    development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we
    expand our product base.

    business, $3.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation
    expense and $2.6 million attributable to other

    and administrative expense increased $22.7 million during
    the year ended



December 30, 2007, compared to the year ended

    expense, $3.4 million in outside legal fees,
    $3.3 million in other outside service expenses, primarily
    due to increases in consulting fees and increased tax, audit,
    and other public company costs.

We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to

During the year ended December 30, 2007, we recorded

    Solexa acquisition. At the acquisition date, Solexa’s
    ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily
    involved with the development of its genetic analysis platform
    for sequencing and expression profiling. These in-process
    research and development projects are comprised of Solexa’s
    reversible terminating nucleotide biochemistry platform,
    referred to as

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry, as well as Solexa’s reagent, analyzer
    and sequencing services related technologies, which were valued
    at $237.2 million, $44.2 million, $19.1 million
    and $2.9 million, respectively, at the acquisition date.
    Although these projects were approximately 95% complete at the
    acquisition date, they had not reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the amounts
    allocated to those projects were written off in the first
    quarter of 2007, the period the acquisition was consummated.
    Acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies by us in
    the future may result in substantial charges for acquired

    respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2015,
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also
    had U.S. federal and state research and development tax
    credit carryforwards of approximately $9.2 million and
    $9.3 million respectively, which begin to expire in 2018
    and 2019 respectively, unless previously utilized.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant
    future changes in our



ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the
    expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to
    utilization. Previous limitations due to Section 382 and
    383 have been reflected in the deferred tax assets as of
    December 30, 2007.

As of December 30, 2007, we concluded that it is more
    likely than not that a significant portion of our deferred tax
    assets will be realized and, accordingly we released a portion
    of our valuation allowance, approximately $17.1 million of
    which was recorded as a reduction to the tax provision. In
    addition, we established current and long term deferred tax
    assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of approximately
    $26.8 million and $80.1 million, respectively, and
    decreased the goodwill balances recorded in conjunction with the
    CyVera and Solexa acquisitions by approximately
    $2.1 million and $18.4 million, respectively. Based
    upon the available evidence as of December 30, 2007, we are
    not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain
    U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized.
    Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of
    approximately $2.9 million and $25.4 million against
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.

Total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006 was $184.6 million and
    $73.5 million, respectively. This represents an increase of
    $111.1 million for 2006, or 151%, compared to 2005.

Product revenue increased to $155.8 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $57.8 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2006. The increase in 2006 resulted
    primarily from higher consumable and BeadStation sales. Growth
    in consumable revenue was primarily attributable to the launch
    and shipment of our whole genome genotyping products, the
    HumanHap300 and HumanHap550 BeadChips. In addition, growth in
    consumable revenue can be attributed to the growth in our
    installed base of BeadArray Readers, which has nearly doubled
    since January 1, 2006. Consumable products constituted 66%
    of product revenue for year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to 47% in the year ended January 1, 2006. We
    expect to see continued growth in product revenue, which can be
    partially attributed to the launch of several new products, as
    well as the growth of our installed base of instruments.

Service and other revenue increased to $28.8 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 from $15.7 million
    for the year ended January 1, 2006. The increase in service
    and other revenue is primarily due to the completion of several
    significant Infinium and GoldenGate SNP genotyping service
    contracts. We introduced our Infinium services in early 2006. We
    expect sales from SNP genotyping services contracts to fluctuate
    on a yearly and quarterly basis, depending on the mix and number
    of contracts that are completed. The timing of completion of a
    SNP genotyping services contract is highly dependent on the
    customer’s schedule for delivering the SNPs and samples to
    us. This increase in service revenue was partially offset by a
    decrease in government grants and other research funding of
    $0.5 million over the prior year due primarily to the
    completion of several projects funded by grants from the
    National



Institutes of Health. We do not expect research revenue to be a
    material component of our revenue going forward.

Cost of product and service and other revenue represents
    manufacturing costs incurred in the production process,
    including component materials, assembly labor and overhead,
    installation, warranty, packaging and delivery costs, as well as
    costs associated with performing genotyping services on behalf
    of our customers. Costs related to research revenue are included
    in research and development expense. Cost of product revenue
    increased to $51.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $19.9 million for the
    year ended January 1, 2006, primarily driven by higher
    consumable and instrument sales. Cost of product revenue for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 included stock-based
    compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R totaling $1.3 million. Gross margin
    on product revenue increased to 67.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to 65.5% for the year ended
    January 1, 2006. The increase in gross margin percentage is
    primarily due to the impact of favorable product mix, as well as
    decreased manufacturing costs. A higher percentage of our
    revenue in 2006 was generated from the sale of consumables,
    which generally have a more favorable gross margin than other
    products. The decrease in manufacturing costs is primarily due
    to reduced raw material costs as a result of more favorable
    negotiated contracts with our vendors and improvements in our
    manufacturing processes. This increase in gross margin was
    offset, in part, by the impact of stock-based compensation
    charges, which decreased our gross margin by 83 basis
    points in 2006 compared to 2005.

Cost of service and other revenue increased to $8.1 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to
    $3.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2006,
    primarily due to higher service revenue. Cost of service and
    other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 included
    stock-based compensation expenses resulting from the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R totaling $0.2 million. Gross margin
    on service and other revenue decreased to 71.9% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to 79.3% for the year
    ended January 1, 2006. The decrease is due primarily to a
    change in the mix of projects, as well as the impact of
    stock-based compensation charges, the latter having decreased
    our service and other revenue gross margin by 85 basis
    points in 2006 compared to 2005.

We expect product mix to continue to affect our future gross
    margins. However, we expect our market to become increasingly
    price competitive and our margins may fluctuate from year to
    year and quarter to quarter.

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of

    supplies and other expenses related to the design, development,
    testing and enhancement of our products. We expense our research
    and development expenses as they are incurred.



Research and development expenses increased to
    $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to $27.8 million for the year ended
    January 1, 2006. Research and development expenses for the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006
    included stock-based compensation expenses primarily resulting
    from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R totaling
    $3.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Exclusive
    of these stock-based compensation charges, the increase in
    research and development expenses for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 is primarily due to the development of
    our recently-acquired VeraCode technology purchased in
    conjunction with our acquisition of CyVera in April 2005. We
    launched the first products resulting from this acquisition
    during the first quarter of 2007. Research and development
    expenses related to the VeraCode technology increased
    $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    compared to the year ended January 1, 2006. In addition,
    costs to support our Oligator technology platform and BeadArray
    research activities decreased $1.0 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended
    January 1, 2006.

We believe a substantial investment in research and development
    is essential to remaining competitive and expanding into
    additional markets. Accordingly, we expect our research and
    development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we
    expand our product base and integrate the operations of Solexa
    into our business.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $10.6 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year
    ended January 1, 2006. The increase is primarily due to
    increases of $6.5 million attributable to personnel-related
    expenses, $3.2 million of stock-based compensation expense
    and $0.9 million attributable to other
    non-personnel-related costs, mainly sales and marketing
    activities for our existing and new products. General and
    administrative expenses increased $15.3 million during the
    year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the year ended
    January 1, 2006, due to increases of $5.5 million of
    stock-based compensation expense, $5.3 million in outside
    legal costs related to the Affymetrix litigation,
    $3.1 million in personnel-related expenses associated with
    the growth of our business and $1.4 million in outside
    consulting costs. Outside consulting costs primarily include tax
    and audit fees and general legal expenses not associated with
    the Affymetrix litigation.

We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to
    increase in absolute dollars as we expand our staff, add sales
    and marketing infrastructure, incur increased litigation costs
    and incur additional costs to support the growth in our business.

The provision for income taxes was approximately
    $2.7 million in 2006, up from $0.2 million in 2005. In
    2006, the provision principally consists of federal and state
    alternative minimum tax and income tax expense related to
    foreign operations. In 2005, the provision for income taxes
    consisted of income tax expense related to foreign operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, we utilized
    approximately $25.9 million and $16.6 million of our
    federal and state net operating loss carryforwards,
    respectively, to reduce our federal and state income taxes. As
    of December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    approximately $76.4 million and $39.1 million,
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2022 and 2013,
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, we also
    had U.S. federal and state research and development tax
    credit carryforwards of approximately $6.4 million and
    $6.3 million respectively, which begin to expire in 2018
    and 2019 respectively, unless previously utilized.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be
    subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant
    future changes in our ownership structure. These annual
    limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses
    and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations due to
    Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the deferred tax
    assets as of December 31, 2006.

Based upon the available evidence as of December 31, 2006,
    we are not able to conclude it is more likely than not the
    remaining deferred tax assets in the U.S. will be realized.
    Therefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against
    the U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately
    $36.5 million.

Historically, our sources of cash have included:

•

issuance of equity and debt securities, including cash generated
    from the exercise of stock options and participation in our
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP);

•

cash generated from operations, primarily from the collection of
    accounts receivable resulting from product sales; and

•

interest income.

Our historical cash outflows have primarily been associated with:

•

cash used for operating activities such as the purchase and
    growth of inventory, expansion of our sales and marketing and
    research and development infrastructure and other working
    capital needs;

•

cash used for our stock repurchases;

•

expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing capacity
    and improving our manufacturing efficiency; and

•

interest payments on our debt obligations.

Other factors that impact our cash inflow and outflow include:

•

significant increases in our product and services revenue,
    leading to gross margins greater than 63% in each of the last
    three fiscal years. As our product sales have increased
    significantly since 2001, our gross profit and operating income
    have increased significantly as well, providing us with an
    increased source of cash to finance the expansion of our
    operations; and

•

fluctuations in our working capital.

As of December 30, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments of $386.1 million, compared to
    $130.8 million as of December 31, 2006. We currently
    invest our funds in U.S. dollar-based short maturity mutual
    funds, commercial paper, corporate bonds, treasury notes,
    auction rate securities and municipal bonds. We do not hold
    securities backed by mortgages. As of December 30, 2007,
    our short-term investments included $14.7 million of
    high-grade (AAA rated) auction rate securities issued primarily
    by municipalities and universities. See Part I
    Item 1A: “Risk Factors — Negative conditions
    in the global credit markets may impair the liquidity of a
    portion of our investment portfolio.”

The primary inflows of cash during the year ended
    December 30, 2007 were approximately $390.3 million
    from the net proceeds of our convertible debt offering in
    February 2007, $479.4 million from the sale and maturity of
    our investments in available-for-sale securities, and
    $92.4 million generated from the sale of warrants in
    February 2007. In addition, on January 26, 2007, we
    completed the merger



with Solexa, which resulted in net cash acquired of
    $72.1 million. The primary cash outflows during the year
    ended December 30, 2007 were attributable to the purchase
    of available-for-sale securities for approximately
    $598.4 million, the repurchase of an aggregate of
    7.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately
    $251.6 million, as well as approximately
    $139.0 million for the purchase of a convertible note
    hedge. These convertible note transactions and our stock
    repurchase program are discussed in detail below.

On February 16, 2007, we issued $400.0 million
    principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2014 (the Notes). The net proceeds from the offering, after
    deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering
    expenses, were approximately $390.3 million. We used
    approximately $201.6 million of the net proceeds to
    purchase approximately 5.8 million shares of our common
    stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the
    offering. We used $46.6 million of the net proceeds of this
    offering to pay the net cost of convertible note hedge and
    warrant transactions, which are designed to reduce the potential
    dilution upon conversion of the notes. We are using the balance
    of the net proceeds for other general corporate purposes, which
    may include acquisitions and additional repurchases of our
    common stock. The notes mature on February 15, 2014 and
    bear interest semi-annually at a rate of 0.625% per year,
    payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on
    August 15, 2007. In addition, we may in certain
    circumstances be obligated to pay additional interest. If a
    “designated event,” as defined in the indenture for
    the notes, occurs, holders of the notes may require us to
    repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a
    repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to
    be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition,
    upon conversion of the notes, we must pay the principal portion
    in cash. The notes will become convertible only in certain
    circumstances based on conditions relating to the trading price
    of the notes and our common stock or upon the occurrence of
    specified corporate events, and we expect the notes to become
    convertible beginning in the second quarter of 2008 if the
    trading price of our common stock does not decline from current
    levels. The notes also will, by their terms, become convertible
    at any time from, and including, November 15, 2013 through
    the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    February 15, 2014.

On February 20, 2007, we executed a

Rule 10b5-1

trading plan to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our
    outstanding common stock over a period of six months. We
    repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our common
    stock under this plan for approximately $50.0 million in
    cash. As of December 30, 2007, this plan had expired.

Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to
    change, include expenditures related to:

•

the $90.0 million liability recorded at December 30,
    2007 for the one-time payment made to Affymetrix on
    January 25, 2008, in accordance with the settlement
    agreement entered on January 9, 2008;

•

our facilities expansion needs, including costs of leasing
    additional facilities;

•

the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in
    our current and future manufacturing and research and
    development facilities;

•

support of our commercialization efforts related to our current
    and future products, including expansion of our direct sales
    force and field support resources both in the United States and
    abroad;

•

the continued advancement of research and development
    efforts; and

•

improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency.

Approximately $24.3 million of our net cash generated from
    operations for the year ended December 30, 2007 was used on
    capital expenditures, primarily for manufacturing and research
    and development equipment, furniture, fixtures and computer
    equipment. We expect that our product revenue and the resulting
    operating income, as well as the status of each of our new
    product development programs, will significantly impact our cash
    management decisions.



We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and
    income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating
    needs for at least the next 12 months. Operating needs
    include the planned costs to operate our business, including
    amounts required to fund working capital and capital
    expenditures. At the present time, we have no material
    commitments for capital expenditures. Due to expansion of our
    facilities and manufacturing operations, we anticipate spending
    approximately $25.0 million in capital expenditures during
    2008. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our
    available funds will depend on many factors, including:

•

our ability to successfully commercialize our sequencing and
    VeraCode technologies and to expand our SNP genotyping and
    sequencing services product lines;

•

scientific progress in our research and development programs and
    the magnitude of those programs;

•

competing technological and market developments; and

•

the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or
    acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement
    our product and service offerings.

As a result of the factors listed above, we may require
    additional funding in the future. Our failure to raise capital
    on acceptable terms, when needed, could have a material adverse
    effect on our business.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
    finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have
    been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
    sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
    purposes. During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007,
    we were not involved in any “off balance sheet
    arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission.

Contractual
    Obligations

Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and
    liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude
    orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course
    of business that are not enforceable or legally binding and
    contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict
    future payment. Additionally, the table excludes uncertain tax
    positions of $21.4 million. The expected timing of payment
    of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current
    information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be
    different depending on changes to

agreed-upon

terms or amounts for some obligations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Interest Rate
    Sensitivity

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market
    value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by
    fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating
    rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest
    rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our
    invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk
    and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in
    investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a
    relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio,
    and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move
    in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve
    would not materially affect the fair value of our interest
    sensitive financial instruments.

Market Price
    Sensitive Instruments

In order to reduce the potential equity dilution, we entered
    into a convertible note hedge contract entitling us to purchase
    a maximum of 11,451,480 shares of our common stock (subject
    to adjustment) at an initial strike price of $43.66 per share
    (subject to adjustment). Upon conversion of our Convertible
    Senior Notes, this hedge contract is expected to reduce the
    equity dilution if the daily volume-weighted average price per
    share of our commons stock exceeds the strike price of the
    hedge. We also entered into warrant transactions with the
    counterparties of the convertible note hedge transactions
    entitling them to acquire a maximum of 18,322,320 shares of
    our common stock (subject to adjustment) at an initial strike
    price of $62.87 per share (subject to adjustment). The warrant
    transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per
    share to the extent that the price of our common stock during
    the measurement period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the
    strike price of the warrants. We did not hold any material
    derivative financial instruments for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

Although most of our revenue is realized in U.S. dollars,
    some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies.
    As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors
    such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak
    economic conditions in foreign markets. The functional
    currencies of our subsidiaries are their respective local
    currencies. Accordingly, the accounts of these operations are
    translated from the local currency to the U.S. dollar using
    the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date
    for the balance sheet accounts, and using the average exchange
    rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts. The
    effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income as a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
    (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
    improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
    recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal
    controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable
    laws and our established financial policies.

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of December 30, 2007. Based
    upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer concluded that, as of
    December 30, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective to ensure that (a) the information required
    to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
    under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officers, or
    persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
    evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our
    management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
    matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
    reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
    objectives, and our management have concluded that the
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
    company have been detected.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with
    the participation of our management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in
    our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2007 and that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
    internal control over financial reporting. Other than completing
    the integration of Solexa, Inc.’s internal controls over
    financial reporting into our financial reporting systems during
    the fourth quarter of 2007, that evaluation did not identify any
    such change.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 30, 2007. The
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 30, 2007 has been audited by
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
    herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 30, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Illumina,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 30, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 30, 2007 of Illumina,
    Inc. and our report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Illumina, Inc. as of December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 30,
    2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
    listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial
    statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Illumina, Inc., at December 30, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 30, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006, Illumina, Inc.
    changed its method of accounting for share-based payments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 22, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
    and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on April 28,
    1998. The Company is a leading developer, manufacturer and
    marketer of integrated systems for the large-scale analysis of
    genetic variation and biological function. Using the
    Company’s proprietary technologies, the Company provides a
    comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve
    the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. The
    Company also expects to enter the market for molecular
    diagnostics. The Company’s tools provide researchers around
    the world with the performance, throughput, cost effectiveness
    and flexibility necessary to perform the billions of genetic
    tests needed to extract valuable medical information from
    advances in genomics and proteomics. The Company believes this
    information will enable researchers to correlate genetic
    variation and biological function, which will enhance drug
    discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected
    earlier and permit better choices of drugs for individual
    patients.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
    Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
    14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
    June 30, and September 30. The years ended
    December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2006 were all 52 weeks.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    current year presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2007,
    the Company classified research revenue as part of service and
    other revenue. Research revenue consists of government grants
    and other research funding. For the years ended
    December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006, and
    January 1, 2006, research revenue represented approximately
    $0.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.8 million,
    respectively.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, goodwill and
    related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly
    liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from
    the date of purchase.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities

, to its investments. Under
    SFAS No. 115, the Company classifies its investments
    as “available-for-sale” and records such assets at
    estimated fair value in the

balance sheet, with unrealized gains and losses, if any,
    reported in stockholders’ equity. As of December 30,
    2007, the Company’s excess cash balances were primarily
    invested in marketable debt securities, including commercial
    paper and corporate bonds and notes, with strong credit ratings
    or short maturity mutual funds providing similar financial
    returns. The Company limits the amount of investment exposure as
    to institutions, maturity and investment type. The cost of
    securities sold is determined based on the specific
    identification method.

Restricted
    Cash

As of December 30, 2007, restricted cash, included in cash
    and cash equivalents, consisted of bank guarantees totaling
    approximately $720,000 primarily associated with various sales
    contracts. These guarantees are scheduled to be released during
    2008. As of December 31, 2006, restricted cash consisted of
    two bank guarantees totaling approximately $250,000. Both
    guarantees were released during 2007.

Fair Value of
    Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial
    instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
    notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and
    convertible senior notes approximate fair value.

Accounts and
    Notes Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at net invoice value and
    notes receivable are recorded at contractual value plus earned
    interest. Interest income on notes receivable is recognized
    according to the terms of each related agreement. The Company
    considers receivables past due based on the contractual payment
    terms. The Company reviews its exposure to amounts receivable
    and reserves specific amounts if collectibility is no longer
    reasonably assured. The Company also reserves a percentage of
    its trade receivable balance based on collection history. The
    Company re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and
    adjusts its reserves as needed.

Concentrations
    of Risk

Cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable are
    financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk. Most of the Company’s cash
    and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2007 were deposited
    with financial institutions in the United States and the
    Company’s investment policy restricts the amount of credit
    exposure to any one issuer and to any one type of investment,
    other than securities issued by the U.S. government. The
    Company has historically not experienced significant credit
    losses from investments and accounts receivable. The Company
    performs a regular review of customer activity and associated
    credit risks and generally does not require collateral. The
    Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon
    a percentage of its trade receivable balance based on collection
    history and re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis.

The Company’s products require customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
    Company obtains certain key components included in its products
    from single vendors. No assurance can be given that these or
    other product components will be available in sufficient
    quantities at acceptable costs in the future.

Approximately 43%, 44%, and 38% of the Company’s revenue
    for the years ended December 30, 2007, December 31,
    2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively, was derived from
    shipments to customers outside the United States. Approximately
    46% and 39% of the Company’s net accounts receivable

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

balance as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
    respectively, was related to customers outside the United
    States. Sales to territories outside of the United States are
    generally denominated in U.S. dollars. International sales
    entail a variety of risks, including currency exchange
    fluctuations, longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in
    accounts receivable collection. The Company is also subject to
    general geopolitical risks, such as political, social and
    economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade
    relations. The risks of international sales are mitigated in
    part by the extent to which sales are geographically distributed.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which
    approximates actual cost) or market. Inventory includes raw
    materials and finished goods that may be used in the research
    and development process and such items are expensed as consumed.
    Provisions for slow moving, excess and obsolete inventories are
    provided based on product life cycle and development plans,
    product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and
    inventory levels.

Property and
    Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
    impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets (generally three to seven years) using the
    straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
    computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
    useful life of the related assets.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value
    of net assets acquired. SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

, requires that goodwill be tested
    annually for impairment or more frequently if events and
    circumstances warrant, utilizing a test that begins with an
    estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible
    asset. The Company tests goodwill annually and whenever events
    or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be
    impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment test of
    goodwill as of May 1, 2007, noting no impairment, and has
    determined there has been no impairment of goodwill through
    December 30, 2007.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets include acquired technology, customer
    relationships, other license agreements, and licensed
    technology, which are being amortized over their estimated
    useful lives ranging from three to 10 years (see
    Note 3). The amortization of the Company’s acquired
    technology and customer relationships is excluded from cost of
    product revenue and is separately classified as amortization of
    acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. The Company will begin amortizing licensed
    technology, representing the balance capitalized as part of the
    Affymetrix litigation, in January 2008.

Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

if indicators
    of impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of
    the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the
    carrying value of such assets can be recovered through
    undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is
    indicated, the Company measures the future discounted cash flows
    associated with the use of the asset and adjusts the value of
    the asset accordingly. While the Company’s historical
    operating and cash flow losses are indicators of impairment, the
    Company believes the current and future cash flows to be
    received from the long-lived assets recorded at
    December 30, 2007 will

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

exceed the assets’ carrying value, and accordingly the
    Company has not recognized any impairment losses through
    December 30, 2007.

Reserve for
    Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    instrumentation. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company
    establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses
    associated with system sales. This expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of revenue.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale
    of products and services. Product revenue consists of sales of
    arrays, reagents, flow cells, instrumentation, and
    oligonucleotides (oligos), which are short sequences of DNA.
    Service and other revenue consists of revenue received for
    performing genotyping and sequencing services, extended warranty
    sales and amounts earned under research agreements with
    government grants, which is recognized in the period during
    which the related costs are incurred.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In
    instances where final acceptance of the product or system is
    required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria
    have been met. All revenue is recorded net of any applicable
    allowances for returns or discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
    reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of instrumentation is
    recognized when earned, which is generally upon shipment.
    Revenue for genotyping and sequencing services is recognized
    when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping and
    sequencing analysis data is delivered to the customer.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable,
    the Company ensures there are no refund rights. If payment terms
    are based on future performance, the Company defers revenue
    recognition until the price becomes fixed and determinable. The
    Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors,
    including past transaction history with the customer and the
    creditworthiness of the customer. If the Company determines that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. The Company also sells separately priced maintenance
    (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally for one or
    two years, upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue
    for extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term
    of the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If the Company were to experience an
    increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its
    warrantied products were greater than its estimates, gross
    margins could be adversely affected.

While the majority of its sales agreements contain standard
    terms and conditions, the Company does enter into agreements
    that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and
    conditions. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,

provides
    guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
    delivery or performance of multiple products, services, or
    rights to use assets within contractually binding arrangements.
    For arrangements with multiple elements, revenue recognition is
    based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist
    in the arrangement. A delivered item is considered a separate
    unit of accounting when the delivered

F-10


ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, there is
    objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
    undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a general
    right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or
    performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and
    substantially in the Company’s control. Items are
    considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold
    separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the item
    on a stand-alone basis. Fair value of an item is generally the
    price charged for the product when regularly sold on a
    stand-alone basis. When objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value exists for all units of accounting in an arrangement,
    arrangement consideration is generally allocated to each unit of
    accounting based upon their relative fair values. In those
    instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value
    exists for the undelivered items but not for the delivered
    items, the residual method is used to allocate arrangement
    consideration. Under the residual method, the amount of
    arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items
    equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
    fair value of the undelivered items. When the Company is unable
    to establish stand-alone value for delivered items or when fair
    value of undelivered items has not been established, revenue is
    deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been
    performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
    any remaining undelivered elements. The Company recognizes
    revenue for delivered elements only when it determines that the
    fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no
    uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

Shipping and
    Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
    revenue and totaled $2.2 million, $1.8 million, and
    $1.3 million for the years ended December 30, 2007,
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

Research and
    Development

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
    internal and grant-sponsored research and development. Research
    and development expenses include salaries, contractor fees,
    facilities costs, utilities and allocations of benefits.
    Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed
    in the period incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    costs were $2.8 million, $1.9 million and
    $1.2 million for the years ended December 30, 2007,
    December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

, the provision for income taxes is computed
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
    tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. A
    valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence. As of December 30, 2007,
    the Company maintained a valuation allowance only against
    certain U.S. and

F-11

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

foreign deferred tax assets that the Company concluded did not
    meet the “more likely than not” threshold required
    under SFAS No. 109.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.
    When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
    Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of
    the impact of a tax position in the Company’s financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income
    tax expense.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currencies of the Company’s wholly-owned
    subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. Accordingly,
    all balance sheet accounts of these operations are translated to
    U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated
    using the average exchange rates in effect during the period.
    The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these
    subsidiaries’ financial statements are recorded as a
    separate component of stockholders’ equity under the
    caption “accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to the beginning of fiscal 2006, the Company measured
    compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation
    plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion
    No. 25. The Company applied the disclosure provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure

, as if the fair-value-based method
    had been applied in measuring stock-based compensation expense.
    Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the
    Company’s employee stock options was not less than the
    market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant,
    no compensation expense was recognized.

Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, using the modified prospective
    transition method. The modified prospective transition method
    requires that stock-based compensation expense be recorded for
    all new and unvested stock options, restricted stock and
    employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares that are ultimately
    expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered. As of
    December 30, 2007, approximately $122.9 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options,
    restricted stock and ESPP shares issued to date is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
    two years.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards under
    SFAS No. 123R. This model incorporates various
    assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest
    rates. Historically, the Company used an expected stock-price
    volatility assumption that was primarily based on historical
    realized volatility of the underlying stock during a period of
    time. Beginning the third quarter of 2007, volatility was
    determined by equally weighing the historical and implied
    volatility of the Company’s common stock. The historical
    volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most
    recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated
    expected life of the Company’s stock options, adjusted for
    the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to
    recur and other relevant factors. The implied volatility is
    calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange-traded
    call options on the Company’s common stock. The expected
    life of an award is based on historical experience and on the
    terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees.

The assumptions used for the specified reporting periods and the
    resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of
    options and restricted stock units granted and for stock
    purchases under the ESPP during those periods are as follows:

SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

, was
    issued in December of 2007. SFAS No. 141(R)
    established principles and requirements for how the acquirer of
    a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
    any non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
    SFAS No. 141(R) also provides guidance for recognizing
    and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination
    and determines what information to disclose to enable users of
    the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. The guidance will become
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,

    the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2.  Acquisition
    of Solexa, Inc.

On January 26, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition
    of Solexa, Inc. (Solexa), a Delaware corporation, in a
    stock-for-stock merger transaction. The Company issued
    approximately 13.1 million shares of its common stock as
    consideration for this merger. The results of Solexa’s
    operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements since the acquisition date of
    January 26, 2007.

Upon the closing of the merger on January 26, 2007, there
    were approximately 3.7 million shares of the Company’s
    restricted stock and shares issuable upon the exercise of
    outstanding options and warrants assumed as part of the
    acquisition. Total estimated merger consideration also includes
    approximately $75.3 million, which represents the fair
    market value of the vested options, warrants and restricted
    stock assumed. The Company also expects to recognize
    approximately $14.7 million of non-cash stock-based
    compensation expense related to unvested stock options and
    restricted stock at the acquisition date. This expense will be
    recognized beginning from the acquisition date over a

The fair value of the Company’s shares used in determining
    the purchase price was based on the average of the closing price
    of the Company’s common stock for a range of four trading
    days, comprising of the two days prior to and two days
    subsequent to January 25, 2007, the measurement date. The
    measurement date was determined per the guidance in EITF

No. 99-12,

Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of
    Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business
    Combination

. Based on these closing prices, the Company
    estimated the fair value of its common stock to be $40.14 per
    share, which equates to a total fair value of common stock
    issued of $527.1 million.

Purchase Price
    Allocation

The Solexa purchase price was allocated to tangible and
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
    their estimated fair values at the acquisition date
    (January 26, 2007). The excess of the purchase price over
    the fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill.

The Company believes the fair values assigned to the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed were based on reasonable
    assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimated fair
    values of net assets acquired (in thousands):

certain deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company decreased
    the goodwill balance by approximately $18.4 million from
    the balance as of September 30, 2007 and recorded a
    deferred tax asset as of December 30, 2007.

In-Process
    Research and Development

The Company allocated $303.4 million of the purchase price
    to in-process research and development projects. In-process
    research and development (IPR&D) represents the valuation
    of acquired, to-be-completed research projects. At the
    acquisition date, Solexa’s ongoing research and development
    initiatives were primarily involved with the development of its
    genetic analysis platform for sequencing and expression
    profiling. These in-process research and development projects
    are composed of Solexa’s reversible terminating nucleotide
    biochemistry platform, referred to as

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) biochemistry, as well as Solexa’s reagent, analyzer
    and sequencing services related technologies, which were valued
    at $237.2 million, $44.2 million, $19.1 million
    and $2.9 million, respectively, at the acquisition date.
    Although these projects were approximately 95% complete at the
    acquisition date, they had not reached technological feasibility
    and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the amounts
    allocated to those projects were written off in the first
    quarter of 2007, the period the acquisition was consummated.

The values of the research projects were determined by
    estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into
    commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
    flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to
    their present value. These cash flows were estimated by
    forecasting total revenue expected from these products and then
    deducting appropriate operating expenses, cash flow adjustments
    and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of net
    cash flows arising from the in-process technology. These cash
    flows were substantially reduced to take into account the time
    value of money and the risks associated with the inherent
    difficulties and uncertainties given the projected stage of
    development of these projects at closing. Due to the nature of
    the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth
    and profitability of the developmental projects, discount rates
    of 19.5% were considered appropriate for valuation of the
    IPR&D. The Company believes that these discount rates were
    commensurate with the projects’ stage of development and
    the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above.

If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and
    profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected
    in future periods. The Company believes that the foregoing
    assumptions used in the IPR&D analysis were reasonable at
    the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however,
    that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected
    project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events
    associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.

Identifiable
    Intangible Assets

Acquired identifiable assets include various patents that are
    separate and distinct from the intellectual property surrounding
    the SBS biochemistry platform (core technology) as well as
    customer relationships. These patents are held in both the
    United States and Europe. The Company valued the patents and
    developed technology utilizing a discounted cash flow model
    which uses forecasts of future royalty savings and expenses
    related to the intangible assets. The Company utilized a
    discount rate of 19.5% when preparing this model. The value of
    the customer relationships is the benefit derived, based upon
    estimated cash flows, from having a customer in place versus
    having to incur the time, cost and foregone cash flow required
    to develop or replace the customer. The amounts assigned to the
    core technology and customer relationships are
    $23.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the Solexa purchase price over
    the sum of the amounts assigned to assets acquired less
    liabilities assumed. The Company believes that the acquisition
    of Solexa will produce the following significant benefits:

•

Increased Market Presence and
    Opportunities.

The combination of the Company and
    Solexa should increase the combined Company’s market
    presence and opportunities for growth in revenue, earnings and
    stockholder return. The Company believes that the Solexa
    technology is highly complementary to the Company’s own
    portfolio of products and services and will enhance the
    Company’s capabilities to service its existing customers,
    as well as accelerate the development of additional
    technologies, products and services. The Company believes that
    integrating Solexa’s capabilities with the Company’s
    technologies will better position the Company to address the
    emerging biomarker research and development and in-vitro and
    molecular diagnostic markets. The Company began to recognize
    revenue from products shipped as a result of this acquisition
    during the first quarter of 2007.

•

Operating Efficiencies.

The combination of the
    Company and Solexa provides the opportunity for potential
    economies of scale and cost savings.

The Company believes that these primary factors support the
    amount of goodwill recognized as a result of the purchase price
    paid for Solexa, in relation to other acquired tangible and
    intangible assets, including in-process research and development.

The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results

Investment in
    Solexa

On November 12, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive
    securities purchase agreement with Solexa in which the Company
    invested approximately $50 million in Solexa in exchange
    for 5,154,639 newly issued shares of Solexa common stock in
    conjunction with the merger of the two companies. This
    investment was valued at $67.8 million as of
    December 31, 2006, which represented a market value of
    $13.15 per share of Solexa common stock. This investment was
    eliminated as part of the Company’s purchase accounting
    upon the closing of the merger on January 26, 2007.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued
    $400.0 million principal amount of 0.625% Convertible
    Senior Notes due 2014 (the Notes), which included the exercise
    of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase up to an
    additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of
    Notes. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the
    initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses, were
    approximately $390.3 million. The Company will pay 0.625%
    interest per annum on the principal amount of the Notes, payable
    semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of
    each year. The Company made an interest payment of approximately
    $1.2 million on August 15, 2007. The Notes mature on
    February 15, 2014.

The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable,
    shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value
    per share, based on an initial conversion rate, subject to
    adjustment, of 22.9029 shares per $1,000 principal amount
    of Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of
    approximately $43.66 per share), only in the following
    circumstances and to the following extent: (1) during the
    five

business-day

period after any five consecutive trading period (the
    measurement period) in which the trading price per note for each
    day of such measurement period was less than 97% of the product
    of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common
    stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during
    any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending
    March 31, 2007, if the last reported sale price of the
    Company’s common stock for 20 or more trading days in a
    period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130%
    of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (3) upon
    the occurrence of specified events; and (4) the notes will
    be convertible at any time on or after November 15, 2013
    through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding
    the maturity date.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the Company
    entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the hedge)
    with the initial purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the counterparties) entitling the Company to
    purchase up to 11,451,480 shares of the Company’s
    common stock, subject to adjustment, at an initial strike price
    of $43.66 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, the
    Company sold to these counterparties warrants to acquire up to
    18,322,320 shares of the Company’s common stock (the
    warrants), subject to adjustment, at an initial strike price of
    $62.87 per share, subject to adjustment. The cost of the hedge
    that was not covered by the proceeds from the sale of the
    warrants was approximately $46.6 million and is reflected
    as a reduction of additional paid-in capital as of
    December 30, 2007. The hedge is expected to reduce the
    potential equity dilution upon conversion of the notes if the
    daily volume-weighted average price per share of the
    Company’s common stock exceeds the strike price of the
    hedge. The warrants could have a dilutive effect on the
    Company’s earnings per share to the extent

that the price of the Company’s common stock during a given

Commitments

Deferred
    Gain/Building Loan

In August 2004, the Company completed a sale-leaseback
    transaction of its land and buildings located in San Diego.
    The sale of this property resulted in a $3.7 million gain.
    Effective upon the closing of the sale, the Company leased the
    property back from the buyer for an initial term of ten years,
    which was extended in February 2007 to 19 years. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for
    Leases

, the Company has deferred the gain and is amortizing
    it over the

19-year

lease term.

Operating
    Leases

The Company leases office and manufacturing facilities under
    various noncancellable operating lease agreements. Facilities
    leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many
    contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Certain leases
    require the Company to pay property taxes and routine
    maintenance. The Company is headquartered in San Diego,
    California and leases facilities in Hayward, California,
    Wallingford, Connecticut, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
    Japan, and Singapore.

    the 2005 Stock Plan, issuance of options under the
    Company’s existing 2000 Stock Plan ceased. Additionally, in
    connection with the acquisition of Solexa, the Company assumed
    stock options granted under the 2005 Solexa Equity Incentive
    Plan (the 2005 Solexa Equity Plan). As of December 30,
    2007, an aggregate of up to 13,485,619 shares of the
    Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan and the 2005 Solexa Equity Plan. The 2005 Stock
    Plan provides for an automatic annual increase in the shares
    reserved for issuance by the lesser of 5% of outstanding shares
    of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the
    immediately preceding fiscal year, 1,200,000 shares or such
    lesser amount as determined by the Company’s board of
    directors. As of December 30, 2007, options to purchase
    1,834,384 shares remained available for future grant under
    the 2005 Stock Plan and 2005 Solexa Equity Plan.

The Company’s stock option activity under all stock option

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options
    exercisable as of December 30, 2007 was $376.0 million
    and $161.2 million, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value
    represents the difference between the Company’s closing
    stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period, which
    was $60.09 as of December 28, 2007, and the exercise price
    multiplied by the number of options outstanding. Total intrinsic
    value of options exercised was $72.1 million and
    $34.0 million for the years ended December 30, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively.

2000 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
    adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase
    Plan). A total of 6,233,713 shares of the Company’s
    common stock have been reserved for issuance under the Purchase
    Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase
    common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions,
    during defined offering periods.

The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is
    equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
    first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
    The initial offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition,
    beginning with fiscal 2001, the Purchase Plan provides for
    annual increases of shares available for issuance by the lesser
    of 3% of the number of outstanding shares of the Company’s
    common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
    year, 1,500,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined
    by the Company’s board of directors. 133,481, 266,394 and
    717,164 shares were issued under the Purchase Plan during
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
    December 30, 2007, there were 4,035,180 shares
    available for issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Restricted
    Stock Units

In 2007 the Company began granting restricted stock units
    pursuant to its 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan as part of its
    regular annual employee equity compensation review program.
    Restricted stock units are share awards that, upon vesting, will
    deliver to the holder shares of the Company’s common stock.
    Generally, restricted stock units granted in the year ended
    December 30, 2007, vest over four years as follows: 15% of
    the shares will vest one year from the date of grant, 15% will
    vest two years from the date of grant, 30% will vest three years
    from the date of grant, and 40% will vest four years from the
    date of grant.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity
    and related information in the fiscal year ended
    December 30, 2007 is as follows:

Treasury
    Stock

In conjunction with its issuance of $400 million principal
    amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 on
    February 16, 2007, the Company repurchased 5.8 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock for approximately
    $201.6 million in privately negotiated transactions
    concurrently with the offering.

On February 20, 2007, the Company executed a

Rule 10b5-1

trading plan to repurchase up to $75.0 million of its
    outstanding common stock over a period of six months. The
    Company repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of its
    common stock under this plan for approximately
    $50.0 million. As of December 30, 2007, this plan had
    expired.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the Board of Directors of the Company
    declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the
    Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 (the
    Record Date) to the stockholders of record on that date. Each
    Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
    Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of its
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of
    $100 per unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a person or
    group hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
    the outstanding common stock of the Company or announces an
    offer for 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. If a
    person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase, at the exercise price of the right, a number of shares
    of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
    price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or
    other business combination transaction after a person acquires
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock, each Right will
    entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right’s then-current
    exercise price, a number of common shares of the acquiring
    company which at the time of such transaction have a market
    value of two times the exercise price of the right. The Board of
    Directors will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of
    $0.01 per Right at any time before any such person acquires
    beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock. The rights expire on May 14, 2011 unless such date
    is extended or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
    the Company.

Litigation
    Settlements

In the recent past, the Company incurred substantial costs in
    defending against patent infringement claims and expects, going
    forward, to devote substantial financial and managerial
    resources to protect the Company’s intellectual property
    and to defend against any future claims asserted against the
    Company.

Affymetrix
    Litigation

On January 9, 2008, we resolved all our outstanding
    litigations with Affymetrix, Inc. (Affymetrix) by entering into
    a settlement agreement in which we agreed, without admitting
    liability, to make a one-time payment to Affymetrix of
    $90.0 million. In return, Affymetrix agreed to dismiss with
    prejudice all lawsuits it had brought against us, and we agreed
    to dismiss with prejudice our counterclaims in the relevant
    lawsuits. In exchange for the payment, Affymetrix agreed not to
    sue us or our affiliates or customers for making, using or
    selling any of our current products, evolutions of those
    products or services related to those products. In addition,
    Affymetrix agreed that, for four years, it will not sue us for
    making, using or selling our products or services that are based
    on future technology developments. The covenant not to sue
    covers all fields other than photolithography, the process by
    which Affymetrix manufactures its arrays and a field in which we
    do not operate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The January 2008 settlement resolved complaints Affymetrix had
    previously filed in the U.S. and abroad. Specifically, on
    July 26, 2004, Affymetrix had filed a complaint in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging
    that the use, manufacture and sale of our BeadArray products and
    services, including our Array Matrix and BeadChip products,
    infringe six Affymetrix patents. At that time Affymetrix was
    also seeking an injunction against the sale of any products that
    would ultimately be determined to infringe these patents,
    unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys’ fees.
    Subsequently, on October 24, 2007, Affymetrix had filed
    complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of
    Delaware, in Regional Court in Düsseldorf (Germany), and in
    the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division — Patents
    Court in London (United Kingdom) alleging that the use,
    manufacture and sale of certain of our BeadArray products and
    services, including our Array Matrix and BeadChip products,
    infringe three U.S. patents and three European patents of
    Affymetrix. In its U.S. complaint filed in 2007, Affymetrix
    had also alleged that our sequencing technology, including the
    Genome Analyzer, infringes two Affymetrix U.S. patents.
    Affymetrix also sought an injunction against the sale of any
    products that would ultimately be determined to infringe these
    patents, unspecified monetary damages, interest and
    attorneys’ fees.

As of December 30, 2007, the Company accrued for the total
    $90.0 million payment as a result of the settlement, of
    which $36.0 million was recorded as licensed technology and
    classified as an intangible asset. The remaining
    $54.0 million was charged to expense during the fourth
    quarter of 2007 and is included in income (loss) from operations
    on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This allocation
    was determined in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and

EITF 00-21

using the concepts of fair value based on the past and estimated
    future revenue streams related to the products covered by the
    patents previously under dispute. The value of the licensed
    technology is the benefit derived, calculated using estimated
    discounted cash flows and future revenue projections, from the
    perpetual covenant not to sue for damages related to the sale of
    the Company’s current products. The Company utilized a
    discount rate of 9.25% when preparing this model. The effective
    life and related amortization will be based on the higher of the
    percentage of usage or the straight-line method. This percentage
    of usage will be determined using the revenues generated from
    products covered by the patents previously under dispute. These
    patents expire at various times through 2015.

Former
    Employee Claim

On June 15, 2005, a former employee of the Company filed
    suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Delaware seeking an order requiring the Company and
    the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to correct the
    inventorship of certain of the Company’s patents and patent
    applications by adding the former employee as an inventor,
    alleging that the Company committed inequitable conduct and
    fraud in not naming him as an inventor, and seeking a judgment
    declaring certain of the Company’s patents and patent
    applications unenforceable, unspecified monetary damages and
    attorney’s fees. On January 30, 2008, this dispute was
    resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties by entering
    into a release and settlement agreement pursuant to which all
    claims pending in that litigation were dismissed with prejudice.
    As a result of the settlement, the Company recognized a charge
    of $0.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2007
    in income (loss) from operations on the Consolidated Statements
    of Operations.

Applied
    Biosystems Litigation

On December 26, 2006, the Applied Biosystems Group of
    Applera Corporation (Applied Biosystems) filed suit in
    California Superior Court, Santa Clara County against
    Solexa (which was acquired by the Company on January 26,
    2007). This State Court action is about the ownership of several
    patents assigned in 1995 to Solexa’s predecessor company
    (Lynx Therapeutics) by a former employee (Dr. Stephen
    Macevicz) who is the inventor of these patents and is named as a
    co-defendant in the suit. Lynx was originally a unit of Applied
    Biosystems but was spun out in 1992. On May 31, 2007,
    Applied

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Biosystems filed a second suit, this time against the Company,
    in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
    California. This second suit seeks a declaratory judgment of
    non-infringement of the Macevicz patents that are the subject of
    the State Court action mentioned above. Both suits were later
    consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of California, San Francisco Division.

The Macevicz patents relate to methods for sequencing DNA using
    successive rounds of oligonucleotide probe ligation

(Sequencing-by-Ligation).

The Company’s Genome Analyzer system uses a different
    technology called DNA

Sequencing-by-Synthesis

(SBS), which is not covered by any of these patents. In
    addition, the sequencing technology originally used by Lynx
    Therapeutics (called
    “MPSS

tm

”)
    is not based on the methods covered by the Macevicz patents. In
    any event, the Company has never used
    MPSS

tm

in the Company’s sequencing platform. Furthermore, the
    Company has no plans to use any of the

Sequencing-by-Ligation

technologies covered by these patents. By these consolidated
    actions Applied Biosystems is seeking ownership of the Macevicz
    patents, unspecified costs and damages, and a declaration of
    non-infringement of these patents. Applied Biosystems is not
    asserting any claim for patent infringement against the Company.

Collaborative
    Agreements

deCODE
    genetics

In May 2006, the Company and deCODE genetics, ehf. (deCODE)
    executed a Joint Development and Licensing Agreement (the
    Development Agreement). Pursuant to the Development Agreement,
    the parties agreed to collaborate exclusively to develop,
    validate and commercialize specific diagnostic tests for
    variants in genes involved in three disease-related pathways:
    the gene-encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase, linked to heart
    attack; the gene-encoding transcription factor 7-like 2
    (TCF7L2), linked to type 2 diabetes; and the gene-encoding
    BARD1, linked to breast cancer. The Company and deCODE are
    developing diagnostic tests based on these variants for use on
    the Company’s BeadXpress system.

Under the agreement, the Company will be responsible for the
    manufacturing, marketing and selling of the diagnostic products.
    The companies will share the development costs of these products
    and split the profits from sales of the diagnostics tests. The
    Development Agreement may be terminated as to a particular
    product under development if one party decides to discontinue
    funding the development of that product, and may be terminated
    in whole by either party if the other party commits an uncured
    material breach, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent.
    Under a separate supply agreement, the Company installed
    instrumentation at deCODE that will enable deCODE to perform
    whole genome association studies on up to 100,000 samples using
    the Company’s Sentrix HumanHap300 BeadChips and associated
    reagents. The Company has deferred approximately
    $2.0 million of revenue for instruments installed during
    the third quarter of 2006 under guidance provided by
    SFAS No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists.

This amount is classified as a long-term
    liability as of December 30, 2007. The Company has also
    deferred approximately $1.3 million of costs related to
    product shipments to deCODE, which are classified as a long-term
    asset as of December 30, 2007.

Investment in
    Genizon BioSciences Inc.

In January 2006, Genizon BioSciences Inc. (Genizon), a Canadian
    company focused on gene discovery, purchased from the Company
    approximately $1.9 million in equipment and committed to
    purchase an additional $4.3 million in consumables. The
    Company understands that Genizon is using the Company’s
    products to perform whole-genome and targeted association
    studies involving thousands of members of the Quebec Founder
    Population. The goal of the studies is to provide understanding
    of the genetic origins and mechanisms of common diseases which
    may then lead to possible drug targets.

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In March 2006, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement
    for Secured Convertible Debentures with Genizon. Pursuant to the
    agreement, the Company purchased a Secured Convertible Debenture
    (the Debenture) of Genizon and certain warrants for CDN
    $3.5 million (approximately U.S. $3.0 million).
    The Debenture matures two years from issuance and bears
    interest, payable semiannually, at a rate of 5% per annum for
    the first year and 12.5% per annum for the second year. Unless
    the Debenture is converted before maturity, 112.5% of the
    principal amount of the Debenture is due upon maturity. The
    Company also received warrants to purchase 226,721 shares
    of Genizon Class H Preferred Shares at an exercise price of
    $1.54 per share.

The Company concluded that the purchase of the Debenture and the
    concurrent purchase by Genizon of the Company’s products
    are “linked” transactions under guidance contained in
    EITF

No. 00-21.

Since the transactions are considered “linked,” the
    Company deferred approximately $3.0 million of revenue (the
    face value of the Debentures) in the first quarter of 2006,
    related to the Genizon product shipments. During the fourth
    quarter of 2007, the Company sold the Debenture and warrants to
    third party investors for the face value of the Debenture (CDN
    $3.5 million or approximately U.S. $3.0 million)
    plus accrued interest, at which time the associated deferred
    revenue was recognized. Deferred costs of approximately
    $1.1 million related to product shipments to Genizon were
    also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as
    approximately $0.5 million of foreign exchange gain due to
    the appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the
    U.S. dollar between the debenture purchase and sale dates.

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by
    jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available
    positive and negative evidence. As of December 30, 2007,
    the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that a
    significant portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized
    and, accordingly the Company released a portion of its valuation
    allowance, approximately $17.1 million of which was
    recorded as a reduction to the tax provision. Based upon the
    available evidence as of December 30, 2007, the Company is
    not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain
    U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized.
    Therefore, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of
    approximately $2.9 million and $25.4 million against
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.

As of December 30, 2007, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    approximately $28.7 million and $99.1 million
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2015
    respectively, unless previously utilized. In addition, the
    Company also had U.S. federal and state research and
    development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
    $9.2 million and $9.3 million respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2018 and 2019 respectively, unless previously
    utilized.

As of December 30, 2007, the valuation allowance includes
    approximately $20.2 million of pre-acquisition deferred tax
    assets of Solexa. To the extent any of these assets are
    recognized, the adjustment will be applied first to reduce to
    zero any goodwill related to the acquisition, and then as a
    reduction to the tax provision. During 2007, the Company
    recorded approximately $2.1 million as a

F-32

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reduction to goodwill related to pre-acquisition deferred tax
    assets that previously had a valuation allowance recorded
    against them and were recognized during the year.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating losses and
    credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any
    significant future changes in its ownership structure. These
    annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating
    losses and credits prior to utilization. Previous limitations
    due to Section 382 and 383 have been reflected in the
    deferred tax assets as of December 30, 2007.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.
    When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company. During 2007, the Company realized approximately
    $20.1 million of such excess tax benefits, and accordingly
    recorded a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital.
    As of December 30, 2007, the Company has approximately
    $11.2 million of unrealized excess tax benefits associated
    with share-based compensation. These tax benefits will be
    accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital, if and
    when realized, rather than a reduction of the tax provision.

Residual United States income taxes have not been provided on
    approximately $1.7 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries as of December 30, 2007, since the
    earnings are considered to be permanently invested in the
    operations of such subsidiaries.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
    in tax positions. FIN No. 48 requires recognition of
    the impact of a tax position in the Company’s financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. The adoption of
    FIN No. 48 did not result in an adjustment to the
    Company’s opening stockholders’ equity since there was
    no cumulative effect from the change in accounting principle.

The following table summarizes the gross amount of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions (in thousands):

$

As of December 30, 2007, approximately $5.8 million of
    the Company’s uncertain tax positions would reduce the
    Company’s annual effective tax rate, if recognized.

The Company does not expect its uncertain tax positions to
    change significantly over the next 12 months. Any interest
    and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be
    reflected in income tax expense. As of December 30, 2007,
    no interest or penalties have been accrued related to the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions. Tax years 1998 to 2007
    remain subject to future examination by the major tax
    jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.

Segment
    Information, Geographic Data and Significant Customers

Subsequent to December 30, 2007, the Company reorganized
    its operating structure to further leverage the synergies
    between its sequencing and genotyping businesses. Under the new
    structure, a newly created Life Sciences Business Unit will
    include all products and services related to the research
    market, namely the BeadArray, BeadXpress and Sequencing product
    lines. The Company has also created a Diagnostics Business Unit
    to put more focus on the emerging opportunity in molecular
    diagnostics. The Diagnostics Business Unit plans to develop
    diagnostic content for the BeadXpress system, and ultimately for
    the Company’s sequencing products. For the fiscal year
    ended December 30, 2007, the Company had no activity
    related to the Diagnostics Business Unit and operating results
    were reported on an aggregate basis to the chief operating
    decision maker of the Company, the chief executive officer. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

, the
    Company operated in one segment for the fiscal year ended
    December 30, 2007. Beginning January 2008, the Company will
    have two reportable segments including the Life Sciences
    Business Unit and the Diagnostics Business Unit.

The increase in long-lived assets located in the United States

    December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the Solexa

Litigation
    Settlements

Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into two settlement
    agreements. On January 9, 2008, the Company entered into a
    settlement agreement with Affymetrix to resolve its patent
    litigation (see Note 8). The cash settlement of
    $90.0 million was paid on January 25, 2008. On
    January 30, 2008 a dispute with a former employee was
    resolved regarding the inventorship of certain of the
    Company’s patents. All claims pending in that litigation
    were dismissed with prejudice in accordance with the release and
    settlement agreement (see Note 8). The cash settlement of
    $0.5 million was paid on February 6, 2008.

Investments

At February 19, 2008, the Company held approximately
    $55.9 million of auction rate securities issued primarily
    by municipalities and universities. In February 2008, auctions
    failed for $10.7 million of these auction rate securities
    and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on
    the other auction rate securities in the Company’s
    investment portfolio will continue to succeed and as a result
    its ability to liquidate its investment and fully recover the
    carrying value of the Company’s investment in the near term
    may be limited or not exist. All of the Company’s auction
    rate securities, including those subject to the failure, are
    currently rated AAA, the highest rating, by a rating agency. If
    the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and
    their credit ratings deteriorate, the Company may in the future
    be required to record an impairment charge on these investments.
    The Company believes it will be able to liquidate its investment
    without significant loss within the next year, and currently
    believes these securities are not significantly impaired,
    primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying
    securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of
    the underlying notes (up to 30 years) to realize these
    investments’ recorded value. Based on the Company’s
    expected operating cash flows, and its other sources of cash,
    the Company does not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity
    on these investments will affect its ability to execute its
    current business plan.
