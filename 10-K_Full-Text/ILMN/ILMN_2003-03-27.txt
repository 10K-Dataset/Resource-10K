Business.

Overview

We are a leading developer of next-generation
tools for the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Understanding genetic variation and function is
critical to the development of personalized medicine, a key goal
of genomics and proteomics. Our tools provide information that
could be used to improve drugs and therapies, customize
diagnoses and treatment, and cure disease.

Completion of the sequencing of the human genome
will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in
processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw
genetic data into medically valuable information. This requires
functional analysis of highly complex biological systems,
involving a scale of experimentation not practical using
currently available tools and technologies. Using our
technologies, we have developed a comprehensive line of products
that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of
functional analysis required to achieve the goals of molecular
medicine.

Our patented BeadArray technology uses fiber
optics to achieve a level of array miniaturization that allows
for a new scale of experimentation. An array is a collection of
miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many
tests, or assays, to be performed in parallel. By arranging our
arrays in a pattern that matches the wells of industry standard
containers called microtiter plates, we can simultaneously
process many samples in parallel, achieving throughput
significantly beyond the capability of any technology known to
us. We assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive
materials. Our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to
easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications. These
characteristics allow us to create next-generation arrays with a
unique combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness and
flexibility. In addition, our complementary Oligator technology
permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces
of DNA necessary to perform large-scale genetic analysis on
arrays.

We provide both products and services that
utilize our proprietary technologies. During 2001, we launched
our commercial SNP genotyping services product line which
combines our BeadArray technology with an automated, laboratory
information management system, or LIMS, controlled process to
provide high throughput identification of the most common form
of genetic variation, known as single nucleotide



polymorphisms, or SNPs. We also manufacture
custom oligonucleotides for sale using our proprietary Oligator
technology.

In the third quarter of 2002, we announced the
launch of our production scale genotyping laboratory. This
system is built around our proprietary BeadArray technology.
Included in the system are Sherlock scanning equipment,
GoldenGate assay protocols, LIMS and analytical software,
fluid-handling robotics, and access to Sentrix array matrices
and reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences. Our Sentrix
array matrix is a collection of individual arrays arranged in a
pattern compatible with standard microtiter plates, our reagent
kit uses GoldenGate assay protocols and comprises a set of
chemicals used for performing specific genotyping analyses and
our Sherlock scanning instrument is a confocal laser scanner
used to read our array matrices. Our genotyping system is based
on the production laboratory that has been operational in our
genotyping service product line. When installed, the genotyping
system will be able to routinely produce one million genotypes
per day. As of the end of February 2003, we have signed
agreements for the sale of two genotyping laboratories.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we were named the
largest U.S. participant in the $100 million International
HapMap Project funded by the National Institutes of Health. A
haplotype map of the human genome will allow more rapid and
efficient large-scale genetic association studies aimed at
discovering variants contributing to human disease and
differential response to drug treatments. We are one of five
funded U.S. participants in a worldwide initiative that includes
research groups in Canada, China, Japan, Nigeria and the United
Kingdom. We will be directly responsible for mapping over 15% of
the haplotypes in the human genome. This effort leverages our
Oligator DNA synthesis capability and the production-scale
throughput of our genotyping services operation.

We were incorporated in California in April 1998.
We reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal
executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive,
San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is
(858) 202-4500.

Industry Background

Genetic Variation and
    Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene,
one from each parent. The two copies of each gene may be
identical, or they may be different. These differences are
referred to as genetic variation. Examples of the physical
consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and
hair color. Genetic variation can also have important medical
consequences, including predisposition to disease and
differential response to drugs. Genetic variation affects
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
cause people to respond differently to the same drug. Some
people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
still others may experience adverse side effects. The most
common form of genetic variation is a Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism, or SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single position
in a DNA sequence. It is estimated that the human genome
contains between three and six million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be
responsible for medically important effects, it is now believed
that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result
of the interaction of many SNPs. Therefore, it will be important
to investigate many SNPs together in order to discover medically
valuable information.

Current efforts to understand genetic variation
and function have centered around three principal techniques:
SNP genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics.

SNP Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining
which SNPs are present in each of the two copies of a gene, or
other portion of DNA sequence, within an individual or other
organism. The use of SNP genotyping to obtain meaningful
statistics on the effect of an individual SNP or a collection of
SNPs, and to apply that information to clinical trials and
diagnostic testing, will require the analysis of millions of SNP
genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease.
For example, a single large clinical trial could involve



genotyping 200,000 SNPs per patient in 1,000
patients, thus requiring 200 million assays. Using available
technologies, this scale of SNP genotyping is both impractical
and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping will be used for a
variety of applications, including genomics-based drug
development, clinical trial analysis, disease predisposition
testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping can also be used
outside of healthcare, for example in the development of plants
and animals with desirable commercial characteristics. These
markets will require billions of SNP genotyping assays annually.

Gene Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of
determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group
of cells and is accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary
between genes and proteins. Variation in gene expression can
cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease or
predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression patterns
between cells from different environments, such as normal tissue
compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a
drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in
these processes can be identified. Studies of this type, used in
drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and preferably
tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of samples. Once a
smaller set of genes of interest has been identified,
researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or
suppressed across numerous samples, for example, within a
clinical trial. The high cost of current gene expression methods
has limited the development of the gene expression market.

Once gene expression patterns have been
correlated to specific diseases, gene expression profiling is
expected to become an important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use
of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly
with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and
the availability of more cost-effective technologies.

Proteomics

Proteomics is the process of determining which
proteins are present in cells and how they interact with one
another. Proteomics is another method of correlating the
molecular state of a cell with disease or reaction to a stimulus
such as a drug. This market remains undeveloped, as low cost,
accurate technologies for analysis have not been available. We
expect that proteomics will become valuable in drug discovery
research as the technologies improve and that array technology
will be critical in facilitating the growth of this market.

Our Technologies

BeadArray Technology

We have developed a proprietary array technology
that enables the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
function. Our BeadArray technology combines fiber optic bundles
and microscopic beads in a simple proprietary manufacturing
process to produce array matrices that can perform many assays
simultaneously. Our BeadArray technology provides a unique
combination of high throughput, cost effectiveness, and
flexibility. We achieve high throughput with a high density of
test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in a
pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter
plates. We maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption
of expensive reagents and valuable samples, and from the low
manufacturing costs associated with our complementary
technologies. Our ability to vary the size, shape and format of
the fiber optic bundles and to create specific bead pools for
different applications provides the flexibility to address
multiple markets and market segments. We believe that these
features will enable our BeadArray technology to become a
leading platform for the emerging high-growth markets of SNP
genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology combines
fiber optic bundles and specially prepared beads that
self-assemble into an array. We have the fiber optic bundles
manufactured to our specifications, which we cut into lengths of
less than one inch. Each bundle contains approximately 50,000
individual fibers and 96 of these bundles are placed into an
aluminum housing, which forms an array matrix. In a separate
process, we create sensors by affixing a specific type of
molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a
batch. We make



different batches of beads, with the beads in a
given batch coated with one particular type of molecule. The
particular molecules on a bead define that bead’s function
as a sensor. For example, we create a batch of SNP sensors by
attaching a particular DNA sequence to each bead in the batch.
We combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to
the type of array we intend to create. A bead pool one
milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce
thousands of arrays. One of the advantages of this technology is
that it allows us to create universal arrays for SNP genotyping.
All of our SNP genotyping arrays are manufactured with the same
set of sensors. This allows us to manufacture one type of array,
and by varying the reagent kit, still be able to use it to test
for any combination of SNPs.

To form an array we typically dip each fiber
optic bundle into a pool of coated beads. The coated beads are
drawn into the wells, no more than one bead per well, on the end
of each fiber in the bundle. We call this process self-assembly.
The tens of thousands of beads at the end of the fiber optic
bundle comprise our BeadArray. Because the beads assemble
randomly into the wells, we perform a final procedure called
decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which
well in the array. We employ several proprietary methods for
decoding, a process that requires only a few steps to identify
all the beads in the array. One beneficial by-product of the
decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array. This
quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead
and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We ensure
that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by
having multiple copies of each bead type. This improves the
reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing
statistical processing of the results of identical beads.

One performs an experiment on the BeadArray
matrices by preparing a sample, such as DNA from a patient, and
introducing it to the array. The design features of our
BeadArray matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution
containing the sample. The molecules in the sample bind to their
matching molecules on the coated bead. The Sherlock scanning
instrument detects the matched molecules by shining a laser
through the fiber optic bundle. Since the molecules in the
sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in
response to a laser, detection of a binding event is possible.
This allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to
each coated bead, resulting in a quantitative analysis of the
sample.

Oligator Technology

Genomic applications require many different short
pieces of DNA that can be made synthetically, called
oligonucleotides. For example, SNP genotyping typically requires
three to four different oligonucleotides per assay. A SNP
genotyping experiment analyzing 10,000 SNPs may therefore
require 30,000 to 40,000 different oligonucleotides,
contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment.

We have designed our proprietary Oligator
technology for the parallel synthesis of many different
oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of large-scale
genomics applications. We believe that our Oligator technology
is substantially more cost effective and provides higher
throughput than available commercial alternatives. Our
technology allows for the automated parallel synthesis of
oligonucleotides within each machine. Depending on the length of
the oligonucleotide, each machine can synthesize approximately
2,500 to 3,000 oligonucleotides per day. We believe we can
expand this technology in the future and produce instruments
with greater capacity which will produce oligonucleotides at a
lower cost.

Key Advantages of Our BeadArray and
    Oligator Technologies

We believe that our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies provide distinct advantages, in a variety of
applications, over competing technologies, by creating
cost-effective, highly miniaturized arrays with the following
advantages:

High Throughput.

The
miniaturization of our BeadArray matrix provides significantly
greater information content per unit area than any other array
known to us. To further increase throughput, we have formatted
our arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard
microtiter plates, allowing throughput levels of up to
3 million unique assays per microtiter plate. The
Oligator’s parallel synthesis capability allows us to
manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to
support large-scale genomic applications.



Cost Effectiveness.

Our BeadArray matrix substantially
reduces the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary
manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost
reductions generated by advances in fiber optics, digital
imaging and bead chemistry. In addition, our miniaturized
BeadArray matrix requires smaller volumes than other array
technologies, and therefore reduces reagent costs. Our Oligator
technology further reduces reagent costs, as well as the cost of
coating beads.

Flexibility.

A wide
variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching
different molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and other
chemicals to beads. By using beads, we are able to take
advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of
sensors, which we assemble into arrays using the same
proprietary manufacturing process. In addition, we can have
fiber optic bundles manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes
and organized in various arrangements to optimize them for
different markets and market segments. In combination, the use
of beads and fiber optic bundles provides the flexibility and
scalability for our BeadArray technology to be tailored to
perform many applications in many different market segments,
from drug discovery to diagnostics. Our Oligator technology
allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and
quantities of oligonucleotides.

Accuracy.

The high
density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple
copies of each individual bead type. We measure the copies
simultaneously and combine them into one data point. This allows
us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population
of identical beads, which permits the statistical calculation of
a more reliable and accurate value for each data point. Finally,
the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding
step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead
on every array, improving the overall accuracy of the data.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to make our BeadArray platform the
industry standard for products and services utilizing array
technologies. We plan to achieve this by:

Products and Services

The first implementation of our BeadArray
technology, the Sentrix array, is a disposable matrix with 96
fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the
standard 96-well microtiter plate. Each fiber optic bundle
performs more than 1,100 unique assays. Therefore, one Sentrix
array can perform nearly 110,000 individual assays
simultaneously, more than any other array system known to us.

We have provided genotyping services using our
proprietary BeadArray platform. In addition, we have developed
our first genotyping products based on our Array of Arrays
technology. These products include disposable Sentrix array
matrices, GoldenGate reagent kits for SNP genotyping and
Sherlock scanning instruments.

SNP Genotyping

During 2001, we introduced the first commercial
application of our BeadArray technology by launching our SNP
genotyping services product line. We signed our first services
contract with GlaxoSmithKline in 2001 and we entered into 18
service contracts during 2002. During the last month of the
year, we completed over 34 million genotypes, including
several days in which we operated at two million genotypes per
day. To our knowledge, no other genotyping platform can achieve
comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high
accuracy and low cost.



We have designed our first consumable BeadArray
product, the Sentrix array matrix, for SNP genotyping. The
Sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to
analyze any set of SNPs. We have also developed reagent kits
based on GoldenGate assay protocols and a confocal laser
scanner, Sherlock, which is used to read our array matrices.
These three components, combined with LIMS, standard operating
procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics
comprise our SNP genotyping system. This system was
commercialized in late 2002 and is based on the system that has
been operational in our genotyping service product line for over
a year. When installed, the genotyping system will be able to
routinely produce one million genotypes per day.

In January 2003, we announced the availability of
two assay sets, one for genetic linkage analysis and the other
for fine chromosomal or whole-genome mapping. These standard
products have been deployed in our genotyping services operation
and are also available for customers who use our SNP genotyping
system. Genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal
regions with potential disease associations. Fine mapping
provides dense genotyping and may enable target gene
identification related to a specific disease.

Gene Expression Profiling

We will design our first product for gene
expression profiling to test selected sets of approximately 100
to 2,000 genes on large numbers of samples. We believe that
there is currently a need for a cost-effective and
high-throughput gene expression profiling technology to analyze
the activity of selected sets of genes from many samples
simultaneously.

Scanning Instrumentation

We have developed a confocal laser scanning
instrument, Sherlock, which is used to scan our Sentrix array
matrices and is part of our production scale SNP genotyping
laboratory. This scanning equipment was designed to be used in
all areas of genetic analysis that use our Sentrix arrays.

High-Throughput Synthesis

We have put in place an oligonucleotide
manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of
producing approximately 16 million oligonucleotides per
year. In addition to their use to coat beads, these
oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our
BeadArray products and are used for assay development. Because
our production capacity exceeds our internal needs, we began to
offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in 2001. We
provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in
several scales, with the ability to add many types of
modifications. We offer a range of quality control options and
have implemented a laboratory information management system to
control much of the manufacturing process. In February 2003, we
introduced the first of a series of standard product offerings
in our Oligator product line, a whole-genome oligonucleotide
reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression
microarrays. We believe our proprietary Oligator technology is
more cost effective than competing technologies which has
allowed us to market our oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide
sets under a price leadership strategy.

Partnerships and Collaborations

In November 1999, we entered into a joint
development agreement with Applied Biosystems, a Division of
Applera Corporation, under which the companies would jointly
develop a SNP genotyping system that would combine our
BeadArray

TM

technology with Applied Biosystems’
assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under this agreement, we
were responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and
Applied Biosystems was responsible for developing and
manufacturing the instruments, SNP assay reagents and software
and for marketing the system worldwide. In conjunction with the
agreement, Applied Biosystems purchased 1.25 million shares
of Series C convertible preferred stock at $4.00 per share.
In addition, Applied Biosystems agreed to provide us with
non-refundable research and development support of
$10 million, all of which was provided by December 2001.
Upon commercialization of the system, we were to receive a share
of the operating profits from the sales of all components of
these systems, should such sales occur.



In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. It is our current belief that Applied Biosystems
has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration
product with us. As a result of the delay in developing the
collaboration product, we launched our own production-scale
genotyping system in July 2002. In December 2002, we announced
that we had notified Applied Biosystems that it was in breach of
the joint development agreement. This notification followed a
patent infringement suit filed by Applied Biosystems against us
and a notification from Applied Biosystems alleging that we had
breached the joint development agreement and seeking to compel
arbitration pursuant to the agreement. For further information
regarding this matter, please see ITEM 3, “Legal
Proceedings” and ITEM 7, “Managements’ Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” We do not have any other significant
partnerships or collaborations.

Research and Development

We have made substantial investments in research
and development since our inception. We have assembled a team of
skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
software, manufacturing and other related areas required to
complete the development of our products. Our research and
development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
to optimize our BeadArray and Oligator technologies so that we
can commercialize the initial products and services derived from
these technologies. These efforts include among others:

Our research and development expenses for the
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 (exclusive of charges relating
to stock based compensation of $2.4 million,
$3.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively) were
$26.8 million, $20.7 million and $13.6 million,
respectively. We expect research and development expense to
increase in the future as we continue to expand our research and
product development efforts.



Government Grants

Government grants allow us to fund internal
scientific programs and exploratory research. We retain
ownership of all intellectual property and commercial rights
generated during these projects, subject to a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, paid-up license to practice, for or on behalf
of the United States, inventions made with federal funds. This
license is retained by the U.S. government as provided by
applicable statutes and regulations. We do not believe that the
retained license will have any impact on our ability to market
our products, and we do not need government approval with
respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or
other relationships with third parties. We have seven grants
from the National Institutes of Health, including a
$9 million award in connection with our role in the Human
Haplotyping effort.

Intellectual Property

We have an extensive patent portfolio, including
ownership of, or exclusive licenses to, 23 issued U.S. patents
and 48 pending U.S. patent applications, including one allowed
application that has not yet issued as a patent, some of which
derive from a common parent application. Our issued patents,
which cover various aspects of our BeadArray, oligonucleotide
synthesis and chemical detection technologies, expire between
2011 and 2020. We are seeking to extend this patent protection
on our BeadArray, GoldenGate, Oligator, Sentrix and related
technologies. We have received or filed counterparts for many of
these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
copyright and trademark protection, as well as continuing
technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain our competitive position. Our success will depend
in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our
products and processes, to preserve our copyrights and trade
secrets, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of
third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling
technology or products used with our BeadArray, GoldenGate, and
Oligator, Sentrix and Sherlock technologies.

We are party to various exclusive and
non-exclusive license agreements with third parties, which grant
us rights to use key aspects of our array technology, assay
methods, chemical detection methods, reagent kits and scanning
equipment. For example, we have an exclusive license from Tufts
University to patents filed by Dr. David Walt, a member of
our board of directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory
Board and one of our founders. Our exclusive licenses expire
with the termination of the underlying patents, which will occur
between 2010 and 2017. We also have non-exclusive licenses
related to confocal scanning instrumentation and our GoldenGate
assay. These licenses are critical to our business.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our array matrices, reagent kits,
scanning equipment and oligonucleotides in-house and believe
that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in
sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external
needs. We currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials
used in the manufacture of our products. We intend to continue,
and may extend, the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing
process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best
commercial interests.

During 2001, we moved into a new facility which
allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific
processes, and optimize material flow and personnel movement. In
addition, we have implemented custom laboratory information
management systems for many of our manufacturing and services
operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use. We
adhere to access and safety standards required by federal, state
and local health ordinances, such as standards for the use,
handling and disposal of hazardous substances.

Competition

Although we expect that our BeadArray products
and services will provide significant advantages over currently
available products and services, we expect to encounter intense
competition from other companies that offer products and
services for the SNP genotyping, gene expression and proteomics
markets. These include companies such as Aclara Biosciences,
Affymetrix, Agilent, Amersham Biosciences, Applied



Biosystems, Beckman Coulter, Caliper
Technologies, Luminex, Perlegen Sciences, Sequenom and Third
Wave Technologies. Many of these companies have or will have
substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other
resources and larger, more established marketing, sales,
distribution and service organizations than we do. In addition,
they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets
we need to address. Each of these markets is very competitive
and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of
competition to increase in the future. In order to effectively
compete with these companies, we will need to demonstrate that
our products have superior throughput, cost and accuracy
advantages over the existing products. Rapid technological
development may result in our products or technologies becoming
obsolete. Products offered by us could be made obsolete either
by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or
other technologies. Although we believe that our technology and
products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete
effectively with these companies, we cannot assure you that we
will be successful.

Item
2.

Properties.

Our principal research and development,
manufacturing and administrative facilities occupy approximately
90,000 square feet of three buildings located in San Diego,
California, which we purchased, along with eight acres of
adjacent land, in January 2002. In connection with this purchase
we assumed a $26 million, 10-year mortgage on the property
at a fixed interest rate of 8.36%. We lease a total of 26,000
square feet of this space to two tenants. The land has been
approved for construction of a fourth building. We expect that
these facilities, including the potential fourth building, will
be sufficient for our San Diego based operations for the
foreseeable future.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

In March 2001, a complaint seeking damages of an
unspecified amount was filed against us by a former employee in
the Superior Court of the State of California in connection with
the employee’s termination of employment with Illumina. In
July 2002 a California Superior Court judgment was rendered
against the Company and we recorded a $7.7 million charge
in our financial results for the second quarter of 2002 to cover
total damages and remaining expenses. We believe that the
termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was
unsupported by evidence presented at the trial. A notice of
appeal in this case was filed on October 10, 2002, and the
appeal process is ongoing. We are also recording interest
expense on the $7.7 million during the appeal based on the
statutory rate.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems Group filed
a patent infringement suit against Illumina in the Federal
District Court in Northern California asserting infringement of
several patents related to an Applied Biosystems’ assay
intended for use in our collaboration. To date, Applied
Biosystems has not yet served us with this patent infringement
complaint. In that complaint, Applied Biosystems is seeking a
judgment granting it damages for infringement, treble damages
alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent
injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement. Also in
December 2002, Applied Biosystems sent a notification to us
alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement
between Illumina and Applied Biosystems entered into in November
1999 and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that
agreement. This notification alleges that our production-scale
genotyping system and our consumables are collaboration products
developed under the joint development agreement, that these
products are being sold within the collaboration field described
in that agreement, and that our commercial activities with
respect to our genotyping system are unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent. Among other relief it sought via an arbitration
proceeding, Applied Biosystems sought compensatory damages of
$30 million, disgorgement of all revenues received from
sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping
services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these
products or services. We responded in a letter notification
dated December 4, 2002 to Applied Biosystems that Applied
Biosystems was in breach of the joint development agreement,
having twice delayed the launch of our collaborative product,
and despite our continual compliance with our obligations under
this agreement, and further disputing that the arbitration
proceeding was appropriate.

On December 11, 2002, we filed a suit
alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and other
allegations against Applied Biosystems in San Diego Superior
Court, and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent
the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by
Applied Biosystems. The court granted our temporary restraining
order on December 12, 2002. We then moved for a preliminary
injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding until a
trial in the superior court case, while Applied Biosystems
brought a motion seeking to dismiss this Superior Court action
and to compel arbitration between the parties. In February 2003,
we amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been
fraudulently induced by Applied Biosystems into entering into an
agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the
purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the
1999 joint development agreement. On February 18, 2003, the
San Diego Superior Court granted our motion for preliminary
injunction to prevent the arbitration process and denied Applied



Biosystem’s motion to compel arbitration
without prejudice. Applied Biosystems subsequently moved to
demur to the claim of fraudulent inducement, and that motion in
now pending. No trial date has been set for this case.

We believe the claims alleged by Applied
Biosystems are without merit in both the patent infringement
case and their enjoined demand for arbitration, and that we have
a strong case regarding our breach of contract and other related
allegations against Applied Biosystems. However, we cannot be
sure that we will prevail in these matters. If we are unable to
successfully defend against these allegations, it could result
in a material adverse affect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We are not currently a party to any other
material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be
involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our
operations in the usual course of business.

Overview

Illumina, Inc. was incorporated in April 1998. We
are developing next-generation tools for the large-scale
analysis of genetic variation and function. The information
provided by these analyses will help enable the development of
personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics and proteomics.
Our proprietary BeadArray technology will provide the
throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to
enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical
industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract
medically valuable information from advances in genomics. This
information will correlate genetic variation and gene function
with particular disease states, enhancing drug discovery,
allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically,
and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients.
Our technology may also have applicability across a wide variety
of industries beyond life sciences and pharmaceuticals,
including agriculture, food, chemicals and petrochemicals.
However, we do not currently expect that these markets will have
the revenue potential of the life sciences market. In the first
quarter of 2001, we began commercial sale of custom
oligonucleotides manufactured using our proprietary Oligator
technology. As a result of our favorable manufacturing cost
structure, we have been able to implement a price leadership
strategy in the plate-based segment of this market and have
steadily been able to grow our market share. In the second
quarter of 2001, we initiated our SNP genotyping services
product line and we have entered into 18 service contracts in
2002. As a result of the increasing market acceptance of our
high throughput, low cost BeadArray technology, we have entered
into significant contracts with many of the leading genotyping
organizations including GlaxoSmithKline, and The Sanger Centre,
and have recently received a $9 million award from the
National Institutes of Health to play a major role in the Human
Haplotyping effort.

In November 1999, we entered into a joint
development agreement with Applied Biosystems under which the
companies would jointly develop a SNP genotyping system that
would combine our BeadArray technology with Applied
Biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under
this agreement, we were responsible for developing and
manufacturing the arrays and Applied Biosystems was responsible
for developing and manufacturing the instruments, SNP assay
reagents, and software and for marketing the system worldwide.
In conjunction with the agreement, Applied Biosystems purchased
1.25 million shares of Series C convertible preferred
stock at $4.00 per share. In addition, Applied Biosystems agreed
to provide us with non-refundable research and development
support of $10 million, all of which was provided by
December 2001. Upon



commercialization of the system, we would receive
a share of the operating profits from the sales of all
components of these systems. We have deferred recognition of
revenue from the research funding of $10 million provided
by Applied Biosystems, and would recognize such amounts as
revenue at the rate of 25% of the total profit share we earn
from the sales of collaborative products, should such sales
occur.

In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. It is our current belief that Applied Biosystems
has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration
product with us. As a result of the delay in developing the
collaboration product, we launched our own production-scale
genotyping system in July 2002. In December 2002, Applied
Biosystems filed a patent infringement suit against us in the
Federal District Court in Northern California asserting
infringement of several patents related to Applied
Biosystems’ patented assay. To date, Applied Biosystems has
not served us with the complaint filed in this suit. Applied
Biosystems is seeking a judgment granting it damages for
infringement, treble damages alleging that such infringement is
willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the
alleged infringement. Also in December 2002, Applied Biosystems
sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the
joint development agreement entered into in November 1999 and
seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement. This
notification alleges that our production-scale genotyping system
and our consumables are collaboration products developed under
the joint development agreement, that these products are being
sold within the collaboration field described in that agreement,
and that our commercial activities with respect to its
genotyping system are unlawful, unfair or fraudulent. Among
other items, Applied Biosystems is seeking compensatory damages
of $30 million, disgorgement of all revenues received from
sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping
services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these
products or services.

In December 2002, we filed a suit alleging breach
of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, unfair competition and other allegations against
Applied Biosystems in San Diego Superior Court, and a motion for
a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our
joint development agreement sought by Applied Biosystems. The
court granted the temporary restraining order. We then moved for
a preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration from
proceeding, while Applied Biosystems brought a motion seeking to
compel arbitration between the parties. In February 2003, we
amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been
fraudulently induced by Applied Biosystems into entering into an
agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the
purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the
1999 joint development agreement. On February 18, 2003, the
San Diego Superior Court granted our motion for preliminary
injunction and denied Applied Biosystem’s motion to compel
arbitration without prejudice. No trial date has been set for
this case. We will continue to treat the $10 million
funding from Applied Biosystems as deferred revenue until the
status of the collaboration agreement has been resolved.

We are in the early stages of proceedings to
resolve the status of the collaboration agreement and the legal
actions brought by both parties. We believe the claims alleged
by Applied Biosystems are without merit in both the patent
infringement case and their enjoined demand for arbitration and
that we have a strong case regarding our allegations against
Applied Biosystems. However, we cannot be sure that we will
prevail in these matters. If we are unable to successfully
defend against these allegations, it could result in a material
adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our production-scale genotyping system is based
on the system developed by the Company that has been operational
in our genotyping service product line since 2001. In addition
to our arrays, it includes the Sherlock proprietary confocal
laser scanner, as well as the highly multiplexed GoldenGate SNP
genotyping assay. We do not believe that any of these product
components are covered by intellectual property held by Applied
Biosystems or are otherwise within the scope of the
collaboration agreement with Applied Biosystems. Consequently,
we would retain all the operating profits, if any, generated
through the sales of systems and consumables rather than share
profits under the collaboration agreement. This system is
initially being marketed to a small number of high throughput
genotyping users, however, over time, we will need to develop
lower throughput versions of the system, as well as additional
genetic analysis applications, which will be marketed more
broadly and require substantial increases in our sales and
marketing expenses.



As a result of the 2001 launch of our SNP
genotyping services and custom oligonucleotide product lines, we
generated commercial product and service revenue of
approximately $1.0 million during fiscal 2001, and
approximately $7.4 million during fiscal year 2002. In
2003, we announced agreements for the sale of our first two
high-throughput SNP genotyping systems. We are seeking to expand
our customer base for these products and services. However, we
have no assurance that our sales efforts will be successful in
developing a market for systems such as this.

We have incurred substantial operating losses
since our inception. As of December 29, 2002, our
accumulated deficit was $90.4 million, and total
stockholders’ equity was $71.7 million. These losses
have principally occurred as a result of the substantial
resources required for the research, development and
manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our
products and services, as well as charges of $8.1 million
related to a termination-of-employment lawsuit. We expect to
continue to incur substantial and increasing costs for research,
development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next
several years. We will also need to significantly increase our
selling, general and administrative costs as we begin to build
up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support
the sale of systems, other products and services. As a result,
we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve
profitability.

Results of Operations

Comparison of Years Ended December 29,
    2002 and December 30, 2001

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001 was $10.0 million and
$2.5 million, respectively. Product revenue increased to
$4.1 million in 2002 from $0.9 million in 2001, mostly
due to higher sales of oligonucleotides. We have continued to
grow sales and market share as a result of our product quality
and price leadership strategy in the plate-based oligonucleotide
market segment. SNP genotyping service revenue was
$3.3 million in 2002 compared to $0.1 million in 2001
as a result of the 18 contracts that were signed during
2002. Government grants and other research funding accounted for
approximately 26% and 60% of our total revenue for the year
ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001,
respectively. We expect grant revenue to generally decline as a
proportion of total revenue over the next few years as product
and service revenue become a more important part of our business.

Cost of Product and Service Revenue

Cost of product and service revenue for the years
ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 was
$3.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The
increase was driven by increased sales of products and services.
Gross margins on product and service revenues were 52% in 2002,
versus 44% in 2001, driven by a more favorable cost structure in
oligo manufacturing. Costs related to research revenue is
included in research and development expense.

Research and Development Expenses

Our research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses,
facility costs and laboratory and manufacturing supplies. Total
research and development expenses increased $6.1 million to
$26.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2002,
from $20.7 million for the year ended December 30,
2001. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by higher
headcount, related personnel costs and higher laboratory and
manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our
BeadArray technology, which is the underlying technology on
which Illumina was founded. During the year ended
December 29, 2002, the research expense to support our
BeadArray activities increased $5.4 million over the same
period in 2001. These additional research and development
expenses were related to activities such as exploring and
optimizing assays for various types of genetic analysis
experiments, increasing the multiplexing level of our arrays,
continuing development of our arrays and the scanning
instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and
optimizing our SNP genotyping services system. Research to
support our Oligator technology platform increased
$0.7 million during the year ended December 29, 2002,
as compared to the year ended December 30, 2001. During
2002, we introduced upgrades to our Oligator



technology that significantly increased capacity
and quality while reducing manufacturing cost, allowing us to
adopt a price leadership strategy in the markets we serve. We
expect that our research and development expenses, including
facilities related costs, will increase moderately over the next
12 months as we transition several products from
development to commercialization and then increase more
substantially in future years to support research and technology
development for new products.

General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing,
finance, human resources, business development and general
management, as well as professional fees, such as expenses for
legal and accounting services. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased $3.4 million to
$9.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2002,
from $5.7 million for the year ended December 30,
2001. A portion of this increase is due to higher legal expenses
related to a termination-of-employment lawsuit and the legal
proceedings regarding Applied Biosystems, as well as higher
expenses related to securing patents. The remaining increase was
due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to
expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and SNP
genotyping services operations. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2002 we began our sales and marketing expansion into
Europe and in early 2003, we began our expansion into Japan. We
expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses
will accelerate as we expand our staff, add sales and marketing
infrastructure and incur additional costs to support our growth.
In addition, as a result of our decision to launch our own
genotyping system, we expect that our selling and marketing
expenses will increase at a faster rate than earlier anticipated
since we will now be solely responsible for the marketing and
support of this system.

Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
    Other Non-Cash Compensation Charges

From our inception through July 27, 2000, in
connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of
restricted stock to employees, founders and directors, we have
recorded deferred stock compensation totaling $17.7 million,
representing the difference between the exercise or purchase
price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for
financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were
granted or such restricted stock was sold. We recorded this
amount as a component of stockholders’ equity and amortize
the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of
the restricted stock and options.

We recognize compensation expense over the
vesting period for employees, founders and directors, using an
accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28.
For consultants, deferred compensation is recorded at the fair
value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 and is
periodically re-measured and expensed in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-18.

We recorded amortization of deferred compensation
of $4.4 million and $5.9 million for the year ended
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.
Subsequent to July 27, 2000, no deferred compensation has
been recorded as all options have been granted at fair market
value.

Litigation Judgment

A $7.7 million charge was recorded in June
2002 to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a
termination-of-employment lawsuit. We believe that the
termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was
unsupported by evidence presented at the trial. We plan to
vigorously defend our position on appeal. A notice of appeal in
this case was filed on October 10, 2002, and the appeal process
is ongoing. During the appeal process, the court requires us to
incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates
until the case is resolved. In the year ended December 29,
2002, we recorded $352,000 for interest.

Interest Income

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents
and investments was $3.8 million and $6.2 million for
the years ended December 29, 2002 and December 30,
2001, respectively. Interest income decreased in 2002 due to
lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective
interest rates.



Interest Expense

Interest expense was $2.3 million for the
year ended December 29, 2002 as compared to
$0.7 million for the year ended December 30, 2001.
Interest expense for the year ended December 29, 2002
resulted primarily from a $26.0 million loan related to the
purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of 2002.

Provision for Income Taxes

We incurred net operating losses for the years
ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, and
accordingly, we did not pay any federal or state income taxes.
We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of
the resulting net deferred tax asset, as the future realization
of the tax benefit is uncertain. As of December 29, 2002,
we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state
tax purposes of approximately $55.6 million and $30.9
million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2008.

We also had federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, which
begin to expire in 2018, unless previously utilized.

Our utilization of the net operating losses and
credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations
pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
Code, and similar state provisions, as a result of changes in
our ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in
the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to
utilization.

Comparison of Years Ended December 30,
    2001 and December 31, 2000

Revenue

Revenue for the years ended December 30,
2001 and December 31, 2000 was $2.5 million and
$1.3 million, respectively. Government grants and other
research funding accounted for approximately 60% and 97% of our
total revenue for the years ended December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively. In 2001, we began sales of
custom oligonucleotides and most of the product revenue for this
year was derived from those sales.

Cost of Product and Service Revenue

Cost of product and service revenue for the year
ended December 30, 2001, which was the first year we
commenced such revenue, was $0.6 million. There was no cost
of product and service revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2000.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased
$7.2 million to $20.7 million for the year ended
December 30, 2001, from $13.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. This increase was due primarily to
increased staffing and other personnel costs to support the
continued research and scale-up of our BeadArray and Oligator
technologies. During 2001, our research activities to support
these technologies increased $5.5 million and
$0.5 million, respectively. The remaining $1.2 million
of expense increase was related to manufacturing process
improvement activities mostly related to automating various
parts of the manufacturing process to improve yields, cost,
quality and processing time.

General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $1.5 million to $5.7 million for the year
ended December 30, 2001, from $4.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000. A portion of this increase
was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required
to launch and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and SNP
genotyping services operations. The remaining increase was due
to personnel and other costs associated with our transition to a
public company and to support our growth as well as higher legal
costs.



Amortization of Deferred Compensation and
    Other Non-Cash Compensation Charges

In connection with the grant of stock options and
sale of restricted common stock to employees, founders and
directors through July 27, 2000, we recorded deferred
compensation of approximately $17.7 million. We recorded
amortization of this deferred compensation of $5.0 million
and $5.4 million for the years ended December 30, 2001
and December 31, 2000, respectively. We recorded an
additional $0.3 million of expense related to restricted
common stock sold to consultants, which was expensed as our
rights to repurchase the common stock lapsed and an additional
$0.3 million charge for the acceleration of vesting of
restricted stock during the year ended December 31, 2000.
In February 2000, we modified all our consultant agreements to
include assurances that the contracts would be fulfilled. In
accordance with these modifications, we recorded additional
deferred compensation of $3.0 million as a component of
stockholders’ equity and amortize this amount as a charge
to operations ratably over the vesting periods of the restricted
stock and options. We recorded amortization of this deferred
compensation of approximately $0.9 million and
$0.8 million for the years ended December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively.

Interest Income

Interest income on our cash and cash equivalents
and investments was $6.2 million and $4.7 million for
the years ended December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000, respectively. Interest income increased in 2001 due to
higher average levels of invested funds partially offset by
lower effective interest rates.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $0.7 million for the
year ended December 30, 2001 as compared to
$0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Interest expense for the year ended December 30, 2001
resulted primarily from a construction loan related to our new
facility and from a loan arrangement for purchases of capital
equipment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 29, 2002, we had cash, cash
equivalents and investments (including restricted cash and
investments of $12.5 million) of approximately
$66.3 million. We currently invest our funds in U.S. dollar
based investment-grade corporate and government debt securities
with average maturities of approximately 18 months.

Our operating activities used cash of
$26.4 million in the year ended December 29, 2002, as
compared to $10.9 million in the year ended
December 30, 2001. The increase in cash used for operating
activities was due primarily to an increase in our net loss for
2002 (net of the non-cash litigation judgment, amortization of
non-cash charges and depreciation expense), and the receipt of
$5.0 million in research funding in 2001, which was
recorded as deferred revenue.

Our investing activities used cash of
$1.8 million in the year ended December 29, 2002 as
compared to $101.7 million in the year ended
December 30, 2001. The decline in cash used in investing
activities was due primarily to the reinvestment of our
investment portfolio from cash equivalents to investment
securities in 2001. This was partially offset by an
$11.8 million increase in capital spending in 2002 that
primarily relates to the purchase of a new facility.

Our financing activities provided cash of
$26.1 million in the year ended December 29, 2002 as
compared to $0.7 million in the year ended
December 30, 2001. Cash provided by financing activities in
2002 resulted primarily from $26.0 million in loan proceeds
related to the purchase of our new facility.

In October 1998, we entered into a
$1.0 million capital equipment lease financing arrangement
with a lease financing corporation. As of December 31,
1999, we had utilized all funds available under this lease
agreement. In April 2000, we entered into a $3.0 million
loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance
purchases of capital equipment, $1.7 million of which
remains available at December 29, 2002.



In July 2000, we entered into a 10-year lease to
rent space in two newly constructed buildings that we now
occupy. That lease contained an option to purchase the buildings
together with eight acres of adjacent land that has been
approved for construction of an additional building. At the time
the lease was executed, we provided the developer with a
$1.6 million letter of credit that was increased to
$3.1 million in the third quarter of 2001, and which was
secured by restricted cash. In addition, we provided the
developer $6.2 million of funding in the form of an
interest bearing, secured loan with a term of approximately one
year and a $0.5 million deposit. In December 2000, we paid
$2.3 million to execute the option to purchase the
buildings and related land. During the third quarter of 2001,
the term of the secured loan expired and the principal and
accrued interest thereon was applied to the purchase price for
the project. The purchase closed in January 2002, at which time,
the letter of credit was cancelled and we assumed a
$26.0 million, 10-year mortgage on the property at a fixed
interest rate of 8.36% which calls for principal and interest
payments of approximately $2.5 million per year until the
loan expires in January 2012 at which time a balloon payment of
$21.2 million will be due.

In June 2002, we recorded a $7.7 million
charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to
a termination-of-employment lawsuit. As a result of the
Company’s decision to appeal the ruling, we filed a surety
bond with the court on October 25, 2002 of 1.5 times the
judgment amount, or approximately $11.3 million. Under the
terms of the bond, we are required to maintain a letter of
credit for 90% of the bond amount to secure the bond. Further,
the Company was required to deposit approximately
$12.5 million of marketable securities as collateral for
the letter of credit and accordingly, these funds will be
restricted from use for corporate purposes until the appeal
process is completed, which we expect will occur within 12 to
18 months.

At December 29, 2002, the total of annual
future minimum lease payments was $0.7 million under
capital lease arrangements that span two years. Total future
minimum principal and interest payments under the mortgage we
assumed in January 2002 are $44.0 million, representing
payments of approximately $2.5 million per year for nine
years with a balloon payment of $21.2 million due at the
end of the 10-year term.

We expect that our current cash and cash
equivalents, investments and funding from existing strategic
alliances and grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated
operating needs for at least 18 to 24 months. However, our
future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available
funds will depend on many factors, including scientific progress
in our research and development programs, the magnitude of those
programs, competing technological and market developments, our
ability to successfully commercialize our SNP genotyping
laboratory and extensions to that product and to expand our
oligonucleotide and SNP genotyping services product lines, the
successful resolution of our legal proceedings with Applied
Biosystems and the successful resolution of our appeal in a
termination of employment lawsuit. Therefore, we may require
additional funding within this time frame and the additional
funding, if needed, may not be available on terms that are
acceptable to us, or at all. Further, any additional equity
financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and
may adversely affect their rights.

Critical Accounting Policies

Since our inception, our activities have
primarily consisted of research and development efforts related
to developing our BeadArray and Oligator technologies.
Accordingly, the large majority of our transactions to date have
related to research and development spending. We expense all
such expenditures in the period incurred. Bulk quantities of
laboratory supplies and manufacturing raw materials are
inventoried when acquired but expensed when placed in use for
research activities.

In 2001, we launched our commercial SNP
genotyping services product line and began to offer
oligonucleotides for sale. Revenue for oligonucleotide sales is
recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the
customer. Revenue for genotyping services is recognized
generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered
to the customer. Research revenue consists of amounts earned
under research agreements with collaborators and government
grants, which is recognized in the period during which the
related costs are incurred.



We have one significant collaborative agreement,
under which we received non-refundable research funding support
of $10.0 million from Applied Biosystems through the end of
2001. All amounts received under that agreement were recorded as
deferred revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) 101. We will continue to reflect these
payments as deferred revenue until the legal status of our
collaborative agreement has been resolved.

We invest our excess cash balances in marketable
debt securities, primarily government securities and corporate
bonds and notes, with strong credit ratings. We classify our
investments as “Available-for-Sale” under SFAS 115 and
record such investments at the estimated fair value in the
balance sheet, with gains and losses, if any, reported in
stockholders’ equity. We periodically review our
investments for other than temporary impairment.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 146 (SFAS 146), “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”.
SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes EITF
Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring).” The principal difference between
SFAS 146 and Issue 94-3 relates to the requirements
under SFAS 146 for recognition of a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity. SFAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost as generally
defined in Issue 94-3 was recognized at the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of
SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early
application encouraged. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
146 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2002. The interim
disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports
containing financial statements for interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2002. We have currently chosen to not
adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. If we should
choose to adopt such a method, its implementation pursuant to
SFAS No. 148 could have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Factors Affecting Our Operating
Results

In addition to the items mentioned above, the
following issues could adversely affect our operating results or
our stock price.

We have generated only a small amount of
    revenue from product and service offerings to date. We expect to
    continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain
    profitability.

We have incurred net losses since our inception
and expect to continue to incur net losses. At December 29,
2002, our accumulated deficit was approximately
$90.4 million, and we incurred a net loss of
$40.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 29,
2002. We expect to continue to incur net losses and negative
cash flow for the foreseeable future. The magnitude of our net
losses will depend, in part, on the rate of growth, if any, of
our revenue and on the level of our expenses. We expect to incur
significant expenses for research and development, for
developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and
marketing efforts to commercialize our products. In addition, we
expect to incur greater selling and marketing expenses in the



future as a result of the launch our SNP
genotyping system. As a result, we expect that our operating
expenses will increase significantly as we grow and,
consequently, we will need to generate significant additional
revenue to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve
profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

Our success depends upon the increasing
    availability of genetic information and the continued emergence
    and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications
in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries. The
usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the
availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying
or treating disease. We are initially focusing on markets for
analysis of genetic variation and function, namely SNP
genotyping, gene expression profiling and proteomics. These
markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as we
anticipate, or reach their full potential. Other methods of
analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and
displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers may
not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically
valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation
and function. If useful genetic data is not available or if our
target markets do not emerge in a timely manner, demand for our
products will not develop as we expect, and we may never become
profitable.

We are an early stage company with no
    commercial sales of microarray or scanning instrument products,
    and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially
    successful products and on market acceptance of our new and
    unproven technology.

We may not possess all of the resources,
capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and
commercialize all the products or services that may result from
our technologies. We currently do not sell our microarray or
scanning instrument products although we expect to have such
sales in early 2003. Our technologies are in the early stages of
commercialization or are still in development. You should
evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities
affecting an early stage company developing tools for the life
sciences and pharmaceutical industries. We must conduct a
substantial amount of additional research and development before
some of our products will be ready for sale. In addition, we are
only at the early phase of offering custom oligonucleotides and
SNP genotyping services. Problems frequently encountered in
connection with the development or early commercialization of
products and services using new and unproven technologies might
limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize
these products and services. In addition, we may need to enter
into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to
commercialize some of our products or services.

Historically, life sciences and pharmaceutical
companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a
variety of technologies. Compared to the existing technologies,
our technologies are new and unproven. In order to be
successful, our products must meet the commercial requirements
of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for
the large-scale analysis of genetic variation and function.

Market acceptance will depend on many factors,
including:



We have limited experience in manufacturing
    commercial products and services. If we are unable to develop
    our manufacturing capability or find third-party manufacturers
    to manufacture our products, we may not be able to launch or
    support our products in a timely manner, or at
    all.

We have limited experience manufacturing our
products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve
significant commercial sales. To date, our manufacturing
activities for arrays have been limited to supplying
pre-commercial products for internal use and to support our SNP
genotyping services product line. We have only recently begun
manufacturing oligonucleotides for commercial sale and operating
our internal SNP genotyping service product line. We are still
in the process of optimizing our commercial manufacturing
process for the scanning instrument that will be part of our SNP
genotyping system. We currently possess only one facility
capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale
to our customers and internal use. If a natural disaster were to
significantly damage our facility or if other events were to
cause our operations to fail, these events could prevent us from
developing and manufacturing our products and services.

The nature of our products requires customized
components that currently are available from a limited number of
sources. For example, we currently obtain the fiber optic
bundles included in our products from a single source. If we are
unable to secure a sufficient supply of fiber optic bundles or
other product components, we will be unable to meet demand for
our products. We will need to enter into contractual
relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production
of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely
basis, for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable
terms. Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain
reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable
costs.

Our current sales, marketing and technical
    support organization may limit our ability to sell our
    products.

We currently have limited sales and marketing and
technical support services and have only recently established a
small direct sales force. In order to effectively commercialize
our genotyping system and other products to follow, we will need
to expand our sales, marketing and technical support staff both
domestically and internationally. We may not be successful in
establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or
distribution arrangements to market our products and services.
In addition, the efforts from a limited sales and marketing
force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance
required to support continued growth of our business.

We may encounter difficulties in managing
    our growth. These difficulties could increase our
    losses.

We expect to experience rapid and substantial
growth in order to achieve our operating plans, which will place
a strain on our human and capital resources. If we are unable to
manage this growth effectively, our losses could increase. Our
ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires
us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational,
financial and management controls, reporting systems and
procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of
talented employees. If we are unable to scale up and implement
improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in
an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies
in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to
make available the products required to successfully
commercialize our technology. Failure to attract and retain
sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our
human resources and could impede our growth.

Any inability to adequately protect our
    proprietary technologies could harm our competitive
    position.

Our success will depend in part on our ability to
obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our
intellectual property in the United States and other countries.
If we do not protect our intellectual property adequately,
competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby
erode our competitive advantage. The laws of some foreign
countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States, and many companies have
encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary
rights abroad. These problems can be caused by the absence of
rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights.



The patent positions of companies developing
tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries,
including our patent position, generally are uncertain and
involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to
protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third
parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are
covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively
maintained as trade secrets. We will apply for patents covering
our technologies and products, as we deem appropriate. However,
our applications may be challenged and may not result in issued
patents. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain
may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing
our technologies or from developing competing products. There
also is risk that others may independently develop similar or
alternative technologies or design around our patented
technologies.

In December 2002, Applied Biosystems filed, but
has not yet served us with, a complaint alleging patent
infringement against us asserting that our GoldenGate assay
infringes several patents related to an Applied Biosystems assay
method. Others may challenge or invalidate our patents or claim
that we infringe the rights of third party patents. Also, our
patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage.
We may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or
enforce our patents, or litigate against third party claims,
which would be expensive and, if we lose, may cause us to lose
some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability
to compete in the marketplace.

We also rely upon trade secret protection for our
confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security
measures to protect our proprietary information. These measures,
however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade
secrets or other proprietary information. We seek to protect our
proprietary information by entering into confidentiality
agreements with employees, collaborators and consultants.
Nevertheless, employees, collaborators or consultants may still
disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to
meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade
secrets.

Litigation or Other Proceedings or Third
    Party Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement Could Require
    Us to Spend Time and Money and Could Shut Down Some of Our
    Operations.

Our commercial success depends in part on our
non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third
parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual
property. Applied Biosystems filed, but has not yet served us
with, a patent infringement suit against us and other third
parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary
technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may
obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our
technologies infringes these patents. We could incur substantial
costs and divert the attention of our management and technical
personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. We
may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents
against others. Furthermore, parties making claims against us
may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which
effectively could block our ability to further develop,
commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award
of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful
claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay
damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We
may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost,
or at all. In that event, we could encounter delays in product
introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or
products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of
these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available
products.

We expect intense competition in our target
    markets, which could render our products obsolete or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we sell. This
    would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability. If
    we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products,
    our revenues may not grow as intended.

We compete with life sciences companies that
design, manufacture and market instruments for analysis of
genetic variation and function and other applications using
technologies such as two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary
electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry,
microfluidics, and mechanically deposited, inkjet and
photolithographic arrays. We anticipate that we will face
increased competition in the future as new companies enter the
market with new technologies. The markets for our products are
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, changes in customer needs,



emerging competition and new product
introductions. One or more of our competitors may render our
technology obsolete or uneconomical. Many of our competitors
have greater financial and personnel resources and more
experience in research and development than we have.
Furthermore, the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies,
which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could
develop competing products. If we are unable to develop
enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product
offerings, our business, financial condition and results of
operations will suffer.

We may need additional capital in the
    future. If additional capital is not available on acceptable
    terms, we may have to curtail or cease operations.

Our future capital requirements will be
substantial and will depend on many factors including our
ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and
services, the need for capital expenditures to support and
expand our business, the progress and scope of our collaborative
and independent research and development projects, the filing,
prosecution and enforcement of patent claims and the success of
our legal proceedings with Applied Biosystems and the appeal of
a wrongful termination lawsuit. We anticipate that our existing
capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned
operations for at least 18 to 24 months. However, we
premise this expectation on our current operating plan, which
may change as a result of many factors. Consequently, we may
need additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability
to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product
development efforts. In addition, we may choose to raise
additional capital due to market conditions or strategic
considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for
our current or future operating plans. To the extent that
additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or
convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities
could result in dilution to our stockholders.

We currently have no credit facility or committed
sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with
$1.7 million unused and available as of December 29,
2002. To the extent operating and capital resources are
insufficient to meet future requirements; we will have to raise
additional funds to continue the development and
commercialization of our technologies. These funds may not be
available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are
not available on attractive terms, we may be required to curtail
operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into
financing, supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive
terms.

If we lose our key personnel or are unable
    to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to
    achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and
scientific personnel. The loss of their services could adversely
impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. We will
need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in
molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing,
sales, marketing and technical support. We compete for qualified
management and scientific personnel with other biotechnology
companies, universities and research institutions, particularly
those focusing on genomics. Competition for these individuals,
particularly in the San Diego area, is intense, and the turnover
rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain management and
scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing
collaborations or developing our products or technologies.

Our planned activities will require additional
expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the
products developed through our technologies, including the life
sciences and healthcare industries. Thus, we will need to add
new personnel, including management, and develop the expertise
of existing management. The failure to do so could impair the
growth of our business.

The ability to commercialize some of our
    current or future products may depend on third party
    collaborators over which we have no control.

We have in the past and may in the future enter
into collaborative agreements to assist in the development and
commercialization of our technology. We have limited or no
control over the resources that any partner or collaborator may
devote to our products. Any of our present or future partners or
collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected.
These partners or collaborators may breach or terminate their



agreements with us or otherwise fail to meet
their obligations or perform their collaborative activities
successfully and in a timely manner. Further, any of our
partners or collaborators may elect not to develop products
arising out of our partnerships or collaborations or devote
sufficient resources to the development, manufacture or
commercialization of these products. If any of these events
occur, we may not be able to develop our technologies or
commercialize our products and our ability to generate revenue
will decrease.

We expect that our results of operations
    will fluctuate. This fluctuation could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Our operating results have fluctuated in the past
and are likely to do so in the future. These fluctuations in our
operating results could cause our stock price to fluctuate
significantly or decline. A large portion of our expenses is
relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment
and personnel. In addition, we expect operating expenses to
continue to increase significantly. Accordingly, if revenue does
not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to reduce our
operating losses.

Due to the possibility of fluctuations in our
revenue and expenses, we believe that quarterly comparisons of
our operating results are not a good indication of our future
performance. For example, our genotyping system sales cycle is
lengthy, the time period between our initial contact with a
potential customer and installation is typically several months
and includes site inspection, training and the effective
demonstration of the installed system. Accordingly, revenues
from system sales may occur in some quarters and not others.
Oligonucleotide sales may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending
on oligonucleotide needs for both our genotyping services
product line and internal research. In addition, sales for all
of our products and services may fluctuate quarter to quarter
depending on market conditions. Our operating results may not
meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. In
that case, our stock price probably would decline

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    about Market Risk.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio.
The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely
impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned
on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases
in interest rates. Under our current policies, we do not use
interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to
interest rate changes. We ensure the safety and preservation of
our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market
risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by
investing in investment grade securities. A hypothetical 100
basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire
interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair
value of our interest sensitive financial instruments.

Our equipment financings, amounting to
$0.6 million as of December 29, 2002, are all at fixed
rates and therefore, have no exposure to changes in interest
rates. In January 2002, we assumed a $26.0 million mortgage
in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related
land. The interest rate on this loan is fixed for a 10-year
period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing
market interest rates.

We have operated primarily in the United States;
we began our sales and marketing expansion into Europe in the
third quarter of 2002. Other than employment related expenses
for our European sales personnel, virtually all transactions to
date have been made in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we have not
had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate
fluctuations, nor do we have any foreign currency hedging
instruments in place.

Item 14.

Controls and Procedures.

We have established and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures to ensure that we record, process,
summarize, and report information we are required to disclose in
our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the manner and within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms. We also design our disclosure
controls to ensure that the information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We also maintain
internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with
applicable laws and our established financial policies. We
design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
(2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
recorded and reported in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

We have evaluated the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether they are
effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required
information is timely made in accordance with the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. This evaluation was made under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer within the 90-day
period prior to the filing of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Our management does not expect that our
disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all
error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the



control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control
system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. Notwithstanding, we have designed our internal control
system with a level of controls that we believe will prevent
material errors in our consolidated financial statements.

The chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded, based on their review, that our
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined at Exchange Act
Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c), are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms and that our internal
controls are effective to provide reasonable assurance that our
financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
No significant changes were made to our internal controls or
other factors that could significantly affect these controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of December 29, 2002
and December 30, 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the years ended December 29, 2002,
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Illumina, Inc. at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended
December 29, 2002, December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

1.

Organization and Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies

Organization and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the “Company”) was
incorporated on April 28, 1998. The Company is developing
next-generation tools that will permit the large-scale analysis
of genetic variation and function. The information provided by
these analyses will help to enable the development of
personalized medicine, a key goal of genomics and proteomics.
The Company’s proprietary BeadArray

TM

technology
will provide the throughput, cost effectiveness and flexibility
necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and
pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests
necessary to extract medically valuable information from
advances in genomics. This information will correlate genetic
variation and gene function with particular disease states,
enhancing drug discovery, allowing diseases to be detected
earlier and more specifically and permitting better choices of
drugs for individual patients.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires that management make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenue and expenses incurred during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly
liquid investments with a remaining maturity of less than three
months from the date of purchase.

Investments

The Company applies Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,

to its investments. Under
SFAS No. 115, the Company classifies its investments
as “Available-for-Sale” and records such assets at
estimated fair value in the balance sheet, with unrealized gains
and losses, if any, reported in stockholders’ equity. The
Company invests its excess cash balances in marketable debt
securities, primarily government securities and corporate bonds
and notes, with strong credit ratings. The Company limits the
amount of investment exposure as to institutions, maturity and
investment type. The cost of securities sold is determined based
on the specific identification method. Realized gains, net of
losses, totaled $782,734 and $366,265 for the years ended
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively.

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

At December 29, 2002 and December 30,
2001, investments consist of the following (in thousands):

Investment maturities at December 29, 2002
are as follows:

Restricted Cash and
    Investments

Restricted cash and investments consist of
$100,000 in a money market fund and securities that are used as
collateral against a letter of credit (see note 7).

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

Financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are
carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair
value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Collectibility of Accounts
    Receivable

We evaluate the collectibility of our trade and
financing receivables based on a combination of factors. We
regularly analyze our customer accounts, and, when we become
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
financial obligations to us, we record a specific reserve for
bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we
reasonably believe is collectible. We also record reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on historical experience.
We re-evaluate such reserves on a regular basis and adjust our
reserves as needed.

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard
cost (which approximates actual cost based on a first-in,
first-out method) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets
(generally three to seven years for equipment and five to forty
years for buildings) using the straight-line method.

License Agreements

Intangible assets consist of three license
agreements. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 17,

Accounting for
Intangible Assets,

license agreements are recorded at cost.
The rights related to one of the license agreements are
amortized over its estimated useful life (five years) and the
Company has amortized $8,333 through December 29, 2002. The
rights related to the other two agreements will be amortized
based on sales of related product and the Company has recorded
no amortization expense for these two agreements as of
December 29, 2002.

Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,

if indicators of impairment exist, the Company
assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by
determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be
recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If
impairment is indicated, the Company measures the future
discounted cash flows associated with the use of the asset and
adjusts the value of the asset accordingly. While the
Company’s current and historical operating and cash flow
losses are indicators of impairment, the Company believes the
future cash flows to be received from the long-lived assets will
exceed the assets’ carrying value, and accordingly the
Company has not recognized any impairment losses through
December 29, 2002.

Revenue Recognition

Product revenue consists of sales of
oligonucleotides to third parties and sales of arrays to
collaborators. Service revenue consists of revenue received for
performing SNP genotyping services. Revenue for oligonucleotide
and array sales is recognized generally upon shipment and
transfer of title to the customer. Revenues for genotyping
services are recognized generally at the time the genotyping
analysis data is delivered to the customer. Research revenue
consists of amounts earned under research agreements with
collaborators and government grants, which is recognized in the
period during which the related costs are incurred.

The Company received $10 million of
non-refundable research funding from Applied Biosystems in
connection with a licensing and development contract entered
into in 1999. This amount has been recorded as deferred revenue
in accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) 101. This amount would be recognized as
revenue at a rate of 25% of the defined operating profit earned
from sales of the products covered by the collaboration
agreement, should such sales occur. At present, the Company does
not believe a collaboration product will be commercialized under
the partnership agreement and there are legal proceedings
between the parties as more fully described in Footnote 4.
The $10 million of research funding will continue to be
reflected as deferred revenue until the legal proceedings have
been resolved.

ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

Research and Development

Expenditures relating to research and development
are expensed in the period incurred.

Income Taxes

A deferred income tax asset or liability is
computed for the expected future impact of differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
as well as the expected future tax benefit to be derived from
tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense
is generally the net change during the year in the deferred
income tax asset or liability. Valuation allowances are
established when realizability of deferred tax assets is
uncertain. The effect of tax rate changes is reflected in tax
expense during the period in which such changes are enacted.

Stock-Based Compensation

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

the Company
accounts for common stock options granted, and restricted stock
sold, to employees, founders and directors using the intrinsic
value method and, thus, recognizes no compensation expense for
options granted, or restricted stock sold, with exercise prices
equal to or greater than the fair value of the Company’s
common stock on the date of the grant. The Company has recorded
deferred stock compensation related to certain stock options,
and restricted stock, which were granted with exercise prices
below estimated fair value (see Note 3), which is being
amortized on an accelerated amortization methodology in
accordance with FASB Interpretation Number
(“FIN”) 28.

Pro forma information regarding net loss is
required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if
the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under
the fair value method of that statement. The fair value for
these options was estimated at the dates of grant using the fair
value option pricing model (Black Scholes) with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000:
(a) weighted average risk-free interest rate of 3.0% to
6.5%, (b) expected dividend yield of 0%,
(c) volatility ranging from 70% to 127% and (d) five
year estimated life of the options. The weighted average fair
value of options granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $4.39, $7.51
and $12.17, respectively.

For purposes of adjusted pro forma disclosures,
the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the vesting period. The Company’s adjusted pro forma
information is as follows (in thousands except per share
amounts):

The pro forma effect on net loss presented is not
likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on reported
net income or loss in future years because these amounts reflect
less than five years of vesting.

Deferred compensation for options granted, and
restricted stock sold, to consultants has been determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task
Force 96-18 as the fair value of the consideration received or
the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is
more reliably measured. Deferred charges for options granted,
and restricted stock sold, to consultants are periodically
remeasured as the underlying options vest.

Comprehensive Loss

In accordance with SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

the Company has disclosed
comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Net Loss per Share

Basic and diluted net loss per common share are
presented in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings
per Share,

and SAB 98, for all periods presented. Under
the provisions of SAB 98, common stock and convertible
preferred stock that has been issued or granted for nominal
consideration prior to the anticipated effective date of the
initial public offering must be included in the calculation of
basic and diluted net loss per common share as if these shares
had been outstanding for all periods presented. To date, the
Company has not issued or granted shares for nominal
consideration.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic
and diluted net loss per share has been computed using the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Pro forma
basic and diluted net loss per common share, as presented in the
statements of operations, has been computed as described above,
and also gives effect to the conversion of preferred stock into
common stock (using the “as if converted” method) from
the original date of issuance.

The following table presents the calculation of
net loss per share (in thousands except per share data):

The Company has excluded all convertible
preferred stock, outstanding stock options and warrants, and
shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of diluted
loss per common share because all such securities are
antidilutive for all periods presented. The total number of
shares excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per
share, prior to application of the treasury stock method for
options and warrants, was 5,556,455, 5,352,950 and 4,482,069 for
the years ended December 29, 2002, December 30, 2001

Fiscal
Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or

Effect of New
Accounting Standards

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 146,

Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

.
SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes
EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

. The principal difference between
SFAS 146 and Issue 94-3 relates to the requirements
under SFAS 146 for recognition of a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity. SFAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under Issue 94-3, a liability for an exit cost as generally
defined in Issue 94-3 was recognized at the date of an
entity’s commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of
SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early
application encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption
of SFAS 146 to have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

. SFAS
No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002.
The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial
reports containing financial statements for interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company has
currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. If the Company should choose to adopt such a
method, its implementation pursuant to SFAS No. 148 could
have a material effect on our consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

Stock Options

In June 2000, the Company’s board of
directors and stockholders adopted the 2000 Stock Plan. The 2000
Stock Plan amended and restated the 1998 Incentive Stock Plan
and increased the shares reserved for issuance by
4,000,000 shares. In addition, the 2000 Stock Plan provides
for an automatic annual increase in the shares reserved for
issuance by the lesser of 5% of outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock on the last day of the immediately
preceding fiscal year, 1,500,000 shares or such lesser
amount as determined by the Company’s board of directors.

In 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Incentive
Stock Plan (the “Plan”) and had reserved
5,750,000 shares of common stock for grants under the Plan.
The Plan provided for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory
stock options, stock bonuses and rights to purchase stock to
employees, directors or consultants of the Company. The Plan
provided that incentive stock options to be granted only to
employees at no less than the fair value of the Company’s
common stock, as determined by the board of directors at the
date of the grant. Options generally vest 20% one year from the
date of grant and ratably each month thereafter for a period of
48 months and expire ten years from date of grant. In
December 1999, the Company modified the plan to allow for
acceleration of vesting in the event of an acquisition or merger.

A summary of the Company’s stock option
activity from December 31, 1999 through December 29,
2002 follows:

At December 29, 2002, options to purchase
approximately 979,204 shares were exercisable and
4,924,985 shares remain available for future grant.

Following is a further breakdown of the options
outstanding as of December 29, 2002:

2000 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and
stockholders adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“Purchase Plan”). A total of 1,458,946 shares of
the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only
through payroll deductions, during defined offering periods. The
price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is
equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.
The initial offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition,
the Purchase Plan provides for annual increases of shares
available for issuance under the Purchase Plan beginning with
fiscal 2001. 128,721 shares were issued under the 2000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 2002.

Deferred Stock Compensation

Since the inception of the Company, in connection
with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted
stock to employees, founders and directors through July 25,
2000, the Company has recorded deferred stock compensation
totaling approximately $17.7 million, representing the
difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair
value of the Company’s common stock as estimated by the
Company’s management for financial reporting purposes on
the date such stock options were granted or restricted common
stock was sold. In February 2000, the Company modified the
consulting agreements with all of its outside consultants. Under
the modified consulting agreements, the consultants agreed to
pay a substantial financial penalty if they did not fulfill
their performance obligations under the agreements. The amount
of the penalty was determined for each consultant based on the
intrinsic value of the unvested restricted common stock based on
the original purchase price and the fair value of the common
stock as estimated by the Company’s management for
financial reporting purposes on the date of modification. Each
consultant had already vested in a portion of the original
restricted common stock in accordance with the services already
provided, and the amounts related to the vested common stock was
expensed. The deferred consultant compensation related to the
unvested stock of $3.0 million was recorded in February
2000. Deferred compensation is included as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity and is being amortized to expense over
the vesting period of the options and restricted stock. During
the year ended December 29, 2002, the Company recorded
amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of
approximately $4.4 million.

Shares Reserved for Future
    Issuance

At December 29, 2002, the Company has
reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows
(in thousands):

4.     Collaborative
Agreements

Applera Corporation

In November 1999, the Company entered into a
joint development agreement with Applied Biosystems Group
(“Applied Biosystems”) under which the companies would
jointly develop a SNP genotyping system that would combine the
Company’s BeadArray technology with Applied
Biosystems’ assay chemistry and scanner technology. Under
this agreement, the Company was responsible for developing and
manufacturing the arrays and Applied Biosystems was responsible
for developing and manufacturing the instruments, SNP assay
reagents, and software and marketing for the system worldwide.
In conjunction with the agreement, Applied Biosystems purchased
1,250,000 shares of Series C convertible preferred
stock at $4.00 per share. In addition, Applied Biosystems
agreed to provide the Company with non-refundable research and
development support of $10,000,000, all of which was provided by
December 2001. Upon commercialization of the system, the Company
would share in the operating profits resulting from the sale of
these systems. The Company has deferred recognition of revenue
from the research funding of $10,000,000 provided by Applied
Biosystems, and would recognize such amounts as revenue at the
rate of 25% of the total profit share the Company earns from the
sales of collaborative products, should such sales occur.

In July 2002, Applied Biosystems indicated that
the planned mid-2002 launch of this genotyping system would be
delayed a second time. This delay was related to Applied
Biosystems’ inability to optimize and multiplex the SNP
assay reagents. It is the Company’s current belief that
Applied Biosystems has no intention of continuing to develop a
collaboration product with the Company. As a result of the delay
in developing the collaboration product, the Company launched
its own production scale genotyping system in July 2002. In
December 2002, Applied Biosystems filed a patent infringement
suit against the Company in the Federal District Court in
Northern California asserting infringement of several patents
related to Applied Biosystems’ patented assay. To date,
Applied Biosystems has not served the Company with the complaint
filed in this suit. Applied Biosystems is seeking a judgment
granting it damages for infringement, treble damages alleging
that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction
restraining the Company from the alleged infringement. Also in
December 2002, Applied Biosystems sent a notification to the
Company alleging that the Company had breached the joint
development agreement entered into in November 1999 and seeking
to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement. This
notification alleges that the Company’s production-scale
genotyping system and its consumables are collaboration products
developed under the joint development agreement, that these
products are being sold within the collaboration field described
in that agreement, and that the Company’s commercial
activities with respect to its genotyping system are unlawful,
unfair or fraudulent. Among other items, Applied Biosystems is
seeking compensatory damages of $30,000,000, disgorgement of all
revenues received from sales of its genotyping system or through
its genotyping services product line and a prohibition of future
sales of these products or services.

In December 2002, the Company filed a suit
alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing, unfair competition and other
allegations against Applied Biosystems in San Diego Superior
Court, and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent
the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by
Applied Biosystems. The court granted the temporary restraining
order.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

The Company then moved for a preliminary
injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding, while
Applied Biosystems brought a motion seeking to compel
arbitration between the parties. In February 2003, the Company
amended its complaint to additionally allege that the Company
had been fraudulently induced by Applied Biosystems into
entering into an agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by
misrepresenting the purpose and intended effect of the
arbitration provision of the joint development agreement. On
February 18, 2003, the San Diego Superior Court granted the
Company’s motion for preliminary injunction and denied
Applied Biosystem’s motion to compel arbitration without
prejudice. No trial date has been set for this case. The Company
will continue to treat the $10,000,000 funding from Applied
Biosystems as deferred revenue until the status of the
collaboration agreement has been resolved.

The Company is in the early stages of proceedings
to resolve the status of the collaboration agreement and the
legal actions brought by both parties. The Company believes the
claims alleged by Applied Biosystems are without merit in both
the patent infringement case and their enjoined demand for
arbitration and that the Company has a strong case regarding its
allegations against Applied Biosystems. However, the Company
cannot be sure that it will prevail in these matters. If the
Company is unable to successfully defend against these
allegations, it could result in a material adverse affect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Other Agreements

The Company has various agreements with several
commercial, governmental and academic organizations for which
the Company performs research activities. For example, the
Company will receive $9 million from the National
Institutes of Health to participate in the International HapMap
Project. These organizations fund the research efforts, the
revenue for which is recognized as the services are provided.

5.     Asset and
Technology Purchase

In March 2000, the Company signed an agreement to
acquire certain tangible assets and rights to certain in-process
technologies in exchange for $100,000 and 175,000 shares of
common stock valued at $1,575,000 ($9.00 per share). The
Company recorded the tangible assets at their fair value of
approximately $50,000. As of the date these technologies were
acquired, they had not achieved technological or commercial
feasibility and there is no significant alternative future use
should the Company’s development efforts prove
unsuccessful. Accordingly, the Company recorded an acquired
in-process technology charge of $1,625,000 in March 2000 related
to the purchase of these technologies.

Four projects were acquired in the purchase of
these technologies. Three projects are related to the
development of instrumentation for oligonucleotide synthesis.
These three projects differ in the size and capacity of the
instrumentation. The first of these projects was approximately
50% complete at the date of acquisition and was completed in
approximately nine months at a cost of $1.0 million.
Revenue from this project commenced in February 2001. The
remaining three projects were approximately 20%, 10% and 20%
complete at the date of acquisition and have no projected
completion date at this time.

6.     Commitments
and Long-term Debt

Building Loan

In July 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year
lease to rent space in two newly constructed buildings that are
now occupied by the Company. That lease contained an option to
purchase the buildings together with certain adjacent land that
has been approved for construction of an additional building. At
the time the lease was executed, the Company provided the
developer with a $1.6 million letter of credit that was
increased to $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2001, and
which was secured by restricted cash. In addition the Company
provided the developer $6.2 million of funding in the form
of an interest bearing, secured loan with a

F-17

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

term of approximately one year and a
$0.5 million deposit. In December 2000, the Company paid
$2.3 million to execute the option to purchase the
buildings and related land. During the third quarter of 2001,
the term of the secured loan expired and the principal and
accrued interest thereon was applied to the purchase price for
the project. The purchase closed in January 2002, at which time
the letter of credit was cancelled and the Company assumed a
$26 million, 10-year mortgage on the property at a fixed
interest rate of 8.36%. The Company is required to make monthly
payments of $208,974 representing interest and principal through
February 2012 at which time a balloon payment of
$21.2 million will be due. As of December 31, 2002 the
carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt approximates
fair value.

At December 29, 2002, annual future minimum
payments under the building loan are as follows (in thousands):

The Company leases approximately 19,000 square
feet of space to a tenant under a lease expiring in June 2003.
Rental income for the years ended December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001 was $679,468 and $108,812, respectively.
There was no rental income in the year ended December 31,
2000.

Leases

In April 2000, the Company entered into a
$3,000,000 loan arrangement to be used at its discretion to
finance purchases of capital equipment. The loan is secured by
the capital equipment financed. As of December 29, 2002,
$1,682,318 remains available under this loan arrangement. Cost
and accumulated depreciation of equipment under capital leases
at December 29, 2002 is $1,317,682 and $951,406,
respectively. Depreciation of equipment under capital leases is
included in depreciation expense.

At December 29, 2002, annual future minimum
rental payments under the Company’s capital leases are as
follows (in thousands):

Rent expense for the years ended
December 29, 2002, December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 was $141,361, $1,495,395 and $1,324,317,
respectively.

The balances due under these obligations
approximate fair value.

7.     Litigation
Judgment

In June 2002, the Company recorded a
$7.7 million charge to cover total damages and estimated
expenses related to a termination-of-employment lawsuit. The
Company believes that the termination was lawful in all respects
and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at
the trial. The Company plans to vigorously defend its position
on appeal. A notice of appeal in this case was filed on
October 10, 2002, and the appeal process is ongoing. During
the appeal process, the court requires the Company to incur
interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until
the case is resolved. In the year ended December 29, 2002,
the Company recorded $352,000 for interest.

As a result of the Company’s decision to
appeal the ruling, the Company filed a surety bond with the
court equal to 1.5 times the judgment amount or
approximately $11.3 million. Under the terms of the bond,
the Company is required to maintain a letter of credit for 90%
of the bond amount to secure the bond. Further, the Company was
required to deposit approximately $12.5 million of marketable
securities as collateral for the letter of credit and
accordingly, these funds will be restricted from use for general
corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed, which
we expect will occur within 12 to 18 months. The Company
has classified the restricted investments as current along with
the accrued litigation judgment.

8.     Income
Taxes

At December 29, 2002, the Company has
federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $55,550,000 and $30,890,000, respectively. The
federal and state tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in
2018 and 2008 respectively, unless previously utilized. The
Company also has federal and state research and development tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $2,430,000 and $1,780,000
respectively, which will begin to expire in 2018, unless
previously utilized.

Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the
Internal Revenue Code, annual use of the Company’s net
operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the
event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50%
within a three year period.

Significant components of the Company’s
deferred tax assets as of December 29, 2002 and
December 30, 2001 are shown below (in thousands). A
valuation allowance has been established as of December 29,
2002 and December 30, 2001 to offset the deferred tax
assets as realization of such assets is uncertain.
