PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of
    integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function. We were incorporated in California in April
    1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000. Our principal
    executive offices are located at 9885 Towne Centre Drive,
    San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is

(858) 202-4500.

Using our proprietary technologies, we provide a comprehensive
    line of products and services that currently serve the
    sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression markets, and we
    expect to enter the market for molecular diagnostics. Our
    customers include leading genomic research centers,
    pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical
    research organizations, and biotechnology companies.

We develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to
    perform a range of analyses, including de novo sequencing, whole
    genome re-sequencing, gene expression analysis, and small RNA
    analysis. Our product and service offerings also include
    leading-edge solutions for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
    genotyping, copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation
    studies, gene expression profiling, and low-multiplex analysis
    of DNA, RNA, and protein. We believe we are the only company
    with genome-scale technology for sequencing, genotyping, and
    gene expression — the three cornerstones of modern
    genetic analysis.

Our tools provide researchers around the world with the
    performance, throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility
    necessary to determine and analyze the billions of bits of
    genetic information needed to extract valuable medical
    information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We believe
    this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic
    variation and biological function, which will enhance drug
    discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected
    earlier, and permit better choices of drugs for individual
    patients.

In 2007 we acquired Solexa, Inc. As a result of that
    transaction, we acquired the sequencing technology utilized in
    our HiSeq 2000 and Genome Analyzer instrument platforms. These
    products perform DNA sequencing based on a proprietary
    reversible terminator

sequencing-by-synthesis

(SBS) chemistry.

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into two newly-created business segments, the Life
    Sciences Business Unit and the Diagnostics Business Unit. During
    2009, the Diagnostics Business Unit had limited business
    activity and, accordingly, operating results are reported on an
    aggregate basis as one operating segment. In the future, at each
    reporting period end, we will reassess our reportable operating
    segments, particularly as we enter the market for molecular
    diagnostics.

Industry
    Background

DNA,
    RNA, and Protein

The genetic content that controls an organism’s living
    cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. The human
    body, for instance, is composed of billions of cells, each
    containing DNA, which encodes the basic instructions for
    cellular function. The complete set of an organism’s DNA is
    called its genome. The human genome is organized into 23 pairs
    of chromosomes that are further divided into over 30,000 smaller
    regions called genes. Each gene is comprised of a string of
    nucleotide bases labeled A, C, G, and T, representing adenine,
    cytosine, guanine, and thymine, respectively. Human DNA has
    approximately 3 billion nucleotide bases and their precise
    order is known as the DNA sequence. When a gene is
    “expressed,” a partial copy of its DNA
    sequence — called messenger RNA or mRNA — is
    used as a template to direct the synthesis of a protein.
    Proteins, in turn, direct all cellular function.



Genetic
    Variation and Biological Function

Every person inherits two copies of each gene — one
    from each parent. The two copies of each gene may be identical,
    or they may be different. These differences are referred to as
    genetic variation. Examples of the physical consequences of
    genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color.
    Genetic variation can also have important medical consequences.
    Genetic variation affects disease susceptibility, including
    predisposition to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
    Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, genetic variation may
    cause people to respond differently to the same drug treatment.
    Some people may respond well, others may not respond at all, and
    still others may experience adverse side effects. A common form
    of genetic variation is a SNP. A SNP is a variation in a single
    position of a nucleotide base in a DNA sequence. It is estimated
    that the human genome contains over 30 million SNPs.

While in some cases a single SNP will be responsible for
    medically important effects, it is now believed that
    combinations of SNPs may contribute to the development of most
    common diseases. Since there are millions of SNPs, it is
    important to investigate many representative, well-chosen SNPs
    simultaneously in order to discover medically valuable
    information.

Another contributor to disease is the over- or under-expression
    of genes within an organism’s cells. A very complex network
    of genes interacts to maintain health in complex organisms. The
    challenge for scientists is to delineate the associated
    genes’ expression patterns and their relationship to
    disease. Historically, this problem was addressed by
    investigating effects on a

gene-by-gene

basis. This is time consuming, and difficulties exist when
    several pathways cannot be observed or “controlled” at
    the same time. With the advent of microarray technology,
    thousands of genes can now be tested at the same time.

There are multiple methods of studying genetic variation and
    biological function, including sequencing, SNP genotyping, and
    gene expression profiling, each of which is uniquely addressed
    in our breadth of products and services. Our broad portfolio of
    current products and services supports a range of applications,
    from highest multiplexing (for whole-genome discovery and
    profiling) to mid-and low-multiplexing options (for
    high-throughput targeted screening). Furthermore, our products
    and services support both the upstream discovery process and the
    downstream test development process in order to understand
    genetic variation at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels.

Sequencing

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of
    nucleotide bases (A, C, G, or T) in a DNA sample, which can
    be further divided into de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, and
    tag sequencing. In de novo sequencing, the goal is to determine
    the sequence of a representative sample from a species never
    before sequenced. Understanding the similarities and differences
    in DNA sequence between many species can help our understanding
    of the function of the protein structures encoded in the DNA.

In re-sequencing, the sequence of nucleotide bases is compared
    to a standard or reference sequence from a given species to
    identify changes that reflect genetic variation. Re-sequencing
    studies can be performed on a genome-wide basis, which is
    referred to as whole-genome re-sequencing, or on targeted areas
    of the genome (for example, regions identified by genome-wide
    association studies), which is known as targeted re-sequencing.
    This is an extremely comprehensive form of genetic analysis, in
    which every base is characterized for possible mutations. We
    believe that these underlying discoveries will likely feed the
    development of new array products for broader testing and
    biomarker validation.

In tag sequencing, short sequences, often representative of a
    larger molecule or genomic location, are detected and counted.
    In these applications, the number of times that each tag is seen
    provides quantification of an underlying biological process. As
    an example, in digital gene expression, one or more tag
    sequences may be analyzed for each expressed gene, and the
    number of copies of these tags that are detected in an
    experiment is a measure of how actively that gene is being
    expressed in the tissue sample being analyzed. Similarly, a tag
    sequencing approach known as ChIP sequencing is used to
    determine the locations and extent of protein and DNA
    interactions throughout the genome.



SNP
    Genotyping

SNP genotyping is the process of determining which nucleotide
    base (A, C, G, or T) is present at a particular site in the
    genome within any organism. The most common use of SNP
    genotyping is for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to look
    for an association between DNA sequence variants and a specific
    phenotype of interest. This is commonly done by studying the DNA
    of individuals that are affected by a common disease or that
    exhibit a specific trait against the DNA of control individuals
    who do not have this disease or trait. The use of SNP genotyping
    to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual
    SNP or a collection of SNPs requires the analysis of millions of
    SNP genotypes and the testing of large populations for each
    disease. For example, a single large study could involve
    genotyping more than 1,000,000 SNPs per sample in more than
    1,000 samples, thus requiring one billion assays. Using
    previously available technologies, this scale of SNP genotyping
    was both impractical and prohibitively expensive.

Large-scale SNP genotyping can be used in a variety of ways,
    including studies designed to understand the genetic
    contributions to disease (disease association studies), genomics
    based drug development, clinical trial analysis (responders and
    non-responders, and adverse event profiles), disease
    predisposition testing, and disease diagnosis. SNP genotyping
    can also be used outside of healthcare, for example in the
    development of plants and animals with commercially desirable
    characteristics. These markets will require billions of SNP
    genotyping assays annually.

Gene
    Expression Profiling

Gene expression profiling is the process of determining which
    genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is
    accomplished by measuring mRNA, the intermediary messenger
    between genes and proteins. Variation in gene expression can
    cause disease, or act as an important indicator of disease or
    predisposition to disease. By comparing gene expression patterns
    between cells from different environments, such as normal tissue
    compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a
    drug, specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in
    these processes can be identified. Studies of this type, often
    used in drug discovery, require monitoring thousands, and
    preferably tens of thousands, of mRNAs in large numbers of
    samples. Once a smaller set of genes of interest has been
    identified, researchers can then examine how these genes are
    expressed or suppressed across numerous samples, for example,
    within a clinical trial.

As gene expression patterns are correlated to specific diseases,
    gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important
    diagnostic tool. Diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is
    anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the
    sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more
    cost-effective technologies.

Molecular
    Diagnostics

Molecular diagnostics is the process of examining nucleic acids,
    including DNA and RNA, and protein biomarkers to detect or
    identify infectious diseases, genetic diseases and disorders,
    human cancers, and to help understand

subject-to-subject,

gene-based variation in the efficacy or safety of drug
    substances (pharmacogenics). As knowledge of the genome and its
    function continues to expand, new medical and diagnostic
    applications are being developed. Molecular diagnostic tests can
    be used as diagnostic tools as well as in genetic disease
    susceptibility testing. Molecular diagnostic tests can also be
    used to identify a disease, monitor its progression and response
    to treatment, or predict individual predisposition to a disease
    and individual response to treatment. By identifying small,
    individual genetic differences — or
    variants — that lie at the root of differing drug
    responses, molecular diagnostic tests can be used to select
    appropriate medication and dosage.

Our
    Principal Markets

From our inception, we have believed that the analysis of
    genetic variation and function will play an increasingly
    important role in molecular biology and that by empowering
    genetic analysis, our tools will further disease research, drug
    development, and the development of molecular tests. Our
    customers include leading genomic research centers, academic
    institutions, clinical research organizations, and
    pharmaceutical



and biotechnology companies. In addition, fundamental
    developments in recent years have created significant new
    opportunities for us in the emerging market of molecular
    diagnostics.

Life
    Sciences Research Market

The life sciences research market consists of laboratories
    generally associated with universities, medical research
    centers, government institutions such as the United States
    National Institutes of Health, and other research institutions
    as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
    Researchers at these institutions are using our products and
    services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities, such as:
    next-generation sequencing,

mid-to-high-complexity

genotyping and gene expression (for whole-genome discovery and
    profiling), and low complexity genotyping and gene expression
    (for high-throughput targeted screening). Next-generation
    sequencing is the most rapidly growing of these three areas. It
    is fueled by private and public funding, new global initiatives
    to broadly characterize genetic variation, and the migration of
    legacy genetic applications to sequencing based technologies.

Applied
    Markets

We provide products and services to enable or improve activities
    in particular markets, which we refer to as applied markets. A
    current focus of our products for these markets is in the area
    of agricultural research, including microarrays that contain
    SNPs for custom and focused genotyping of seeds and crops (such
    as maize) and livestock (such as cattle, horses, pigs, and
    sheep). The applied markets may also include opportunities for
    our products and services in the fields of forensic analysis,
    veterinary diagnostics, cytogenics, retail pet genomics, and
    consumer genotyping and sequencing. In July 2009, we launched a
    service program to provide high-quality personal genome
    sequencing for consumers. In connection with our personal
    sequencing service, we collaborate with a number of partners,
    including 23andMe, Inc.; deCODE genetics ehf; Knome, Inc.;
    National Center for Genome Resources; Navigenics, Inc.; and
    Pathway Genomics, to encourage secondary data analysis of a
    personal genome, such as calculation of disease risk, ancestry,
    and information on traits of interest. Although we do not
    perform personal genotyping directly as a service, several
    companies use our technology and products to provide personal
    genotyping services.

Molecular
    Diagnostics Market

The primary growth drivers in the molecular diagnostics market
    are the continued discovery of genetic markers with proven
    clinical utility, the increasing adoption of genetic based
    diagnostic tests, and the expansion of reimbursement programs to
    include a greater number of approved diagnostic tests. We
    believe that molecular diagnostic tests will create a
    fundamental shift in both the practice of medicine and the
    economics of the pharmaceutical industry by creating an
    increased emphasis on preventative and predictive molecular
    medicine. Physicians will be able to use these tests for the
    early detection of disease and to treat patients on a
    personalized basis, allowing them to select the most effective
    therapy with the fewest side effects. We believe our BeadXpress
    instrument platform, using our VeraCode technology, is ideally
    suited to provide a cost-effective, high-throughput, mid- to
    low-multiplex solution to the molecular diagnostic market.
    During the third quarter of 2009, we submitted our BeadXpress
    instrument platform for review by the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA). Assuming FDA approval of this instrument
    platform, we plan to develop clinical diagnostic testing panels
    for use on the BeadXpress instrument platform, including
    possible panels for multi-drug resistant organisms, herpes, and
    respiratory viruses, and we expect to continue research into the
    potential development of cancer diagnostic panels, initially
    focusing on ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. In addition,
    during the fourth quarter of 2009 we made a pre-IDE
    (investigational device exemption) submission with the FDA for a
    cytogenetics test intended to be used as an aid in the postnatal
    diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities known to be associated
    with developmental delay and mental retardation. The pre-IDE
    package included our iScan instrument platform together with
    associated microarrays, reagents, and software. Following
    completion of the IDE process, we intend to seek FDA clearance
    for the iScan instrument platform and related reagents.



Our
    Principal Technologies

Sequencing
    Technology

Our DNA sequencing technology is based on the use of our
    proprietary SBS biochemistry. In SBS, single stranded DNA is
    extended from a priming site, one base at a time, using
    reversible terminator nucleotides. These are DNA bases that can
    be added to a growing second strand, but which initially cannot
    be further extended. This means that at each cycle of the
    chemistry, only one base can be added. Each base that is added
    includes a fluorescent label that is specific to the particular
    base (A, C, G, or T). Thus, following incorporation, the
    fluorescence can be imaged, its color determined, and the base
    itself can be inferred. Once this is done, an additional step
    removes both the fluorescence and the blocking group that had
    prevented further extension of the second strand. This allows
    another base to be added, and the cycle can then be repeated.
    Our technology is capable of generating over 100 billion
    bases of DNA sequence from a single experiment with a single
    sample preparation. The reversible terminator bases that we use
    are novel synthetic molecules that we manufacture. They are not
    well incorporated by naturally occurring polymerases, so we have
    also developed proprietary polymerase enzymes for this purpose.
    Both the nucleotides and enzymes are the subject of significant
    intellectual property owned by us.

In our DNA sequencing systems, we apply the SBS biochemistry on
    microscopic islands of DNA, referred to as DNA clusters. Each
    cluster starts as a single DNA molecule fragment, typically a
    few hundred bases long, attached to the inside surface of a flow
    cell. We then use a proprietary amplification biochemistry to
    create copies of each starting molecule. As the copies are made,
    they are covalently linked to the surface, so they cannot
    diffuse away. After a number of cycles of amplification, each
    cluster might have approximately 1,000 copies of the original
    starting molecule, but still be only about a micron
    (one-millionth of a meter) in diameter. By making so many
    copies, the fluorescent signal from each cluster is
    significantly increased. Because the clusters are so small,
    hundreds of millions of clusters can be independently formed
    inside a single flow cell. This large number of clusters can
    then be sequenced simultaneously by alternate cycles of SBS
    biochemistry and fluorescent imaging. Sequence reads are aligned
    against a reference genome and genetic differences are called
    using specially developed data analysis software.

BeadArray
    Technology

Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a
    substrate in a simple, proprietary manufacturing process to
    produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously,
    enabling large-scale analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function in a unique high-throughput, cost effective,
    and flexible manner. We achieve high-throughput with a high
    density of test sites per array, and we are able to format
    arrays in various configurations in the format of standard
    microscope slides. We seek to maximize cost effectiveness by
    reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples
    and through the low manufacturing costs associated with our
    technologies. Our ability to vary the size, shape, and format of
    the well patterns and to create specific bead pools, or sensors,
    for different applications provides the flexibility to address
    multiple markets and market segments. We believe that these
    features have enabled our BeadArray technology to become a
    leading platform for the high-growth market of SNP genotyping
    and have allowed us to be a key player in the gene expression
    market.

Our proprietary BeadArray technology consists of 2-micron silica
    beads that self-assemble into microwells etched into an array
    substrate. We have deployed our BeadArray technology in two
    different array formats, the Array Matrix and the BeadChip. Our
    first bead based product was the Array Matrix, which
    incorporates fiber optic bundles comprised of approximately
    50,000 individual fibers, with 96 of these bundles placed into
    an aluminum plate to form an Array Matrix. In late 2009, we
    announced that during 2010 we would no longer sell Array Matrix
    products and would instead deploy our BeadArray technology only
    on BeadChips. BeadChips are microscope slide-size silicon wafers
    with varying numbers of sample sites per slide. BeadChips are
    chemically etched to create tens of millions of wells for each
    sample site.

In a separate process, we create sensors by affixing hundreds of
    thousands of copies of a specific type of oligonucleotide
    molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a
    batch. We make different batches of



beads, with the beads in a given batch coated with one
    particular type of molecule. The particular molecules on a bead
    define that bead’s function as a sensor.

To form an array, a pool of coated beads is brought into contact
    with the array surface where they are randomly drawn into the
    wells, one bead per well. The beads in the wells comprise our
    individual arrays. Because the beads assemble randomly into the
    wells, we perform a final procedure called “decoding”
    in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the
    array. We employ several proprietary methods for decoding, which
    is a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the
    beads in the array. One beneficial by-product of the decoding
    process is a functional validation of each bead in the array.
    This quality control test characterizes the performance of each
    bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells. We
    ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently
    represented by including multiple copies of each bead type.
    Multiple bead type copies improve the reliability and accuracy
    of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the
    results of identical beads.

An experiment is performed by preparing a sample, such as DNA,
    and introducing it to the array. The molecules in the sample
    bind to their matching molecules on the coated beads. The
    molecules in either the sample or on the bead are labeled with
    fluorescent dye either before or after the binding, which can be
    detected by shining a laser on the BeadChip. This allows the
    detection of the molecules resulting in a quantitative analysis
    of the sample.

VeraCode
    Technology

Our proprietary VeraCode technology platform leverages the power
    of digital holographic codes to provide a robust detection
    method for multiplex assays requiring high precision, accuracy,
    and speed. VeraCode enables low-cost multiplexing from 1 to
    384-plex in a single well. At the heart of the VeraCode
    technology are cylindrical glass beads measuring 240 microns in
    length by 28 microns in diameter. Each VeraCode bead type is
    inscribed with a unique digital holographic code to designate
    and track the specific analyte or genotype of interest
    throughout the multiplex reaction. When excited by a laser, each
    VeraCode bead emits a unique code image, allowing for quick and
    specific detection by Illumina’s BeadXpress Reader System.
    Depending on desired multiplex levels, assays are created by
    pooling microbeads with code diversities from one to several
    hundred. Unlike traditional microarrays, the VeraCode microbeads
    are used in solution, which takes advantage of solution-phase
    kinetics for more rapid hybridization times, dramatically
    reducing the time to achieve results. This technology enables us
    to serve a number of markets including research, agriculture,
    forensics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular diagnostics.

Our
    Products

Using our proprietary technologies, our products give our
    customers the ability to analyze the genome at any level of
    complexity from whole genome sequencing to low multiplex assays.
    This enables us to serve a number of markets, including
    research, agriculture, forensics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular
    diagnostics. The majority of our product sales consist of
    instruments and consumables based on these various technologies.
    For the fiscal years ended January 3, 2010,
    December 28, 2008, and December 30, 2007, instrument
    sales comprised 34%, 32%, and 33%, respectively, of total
    revenues, and consumable sales represented 59%, 58%, and 53%,
    respectively, of total revenues.

Our
    Services

Sequencing

We have been offering sequencing services since 2007. Our
    services range from small sets of samples requiring as little as
    one run to finish, to large-scale projects, like whole-genome
    sequencing, necessitating multiple instruments running in
    parallel for extended periods of time. The breadth of
    applications offered



includes novel custom products as well as all released products.
    These applications include but are not limited to human whole
    exome and custom targeted re-sequencing, de novo sequencing,
    small RNA discovery and profiling, gene expression using random
    primed RNA sampling technology, ChIP SEQ, and methylome
    interrogation.

Genotyping

We have been offering genotyping services since 2002. Our
    genotyping services offer all of our genotyping products,
    including standard and custom GoldenGate, standard Infinium and
    Infinium HD, as well as iSelect Infinium. Our projects range in
    size from a few hundred samples to over 10,000 samples. Our
    customer base includes academic institutions, and biotech and
    pharmaceutical companies.

Intellectual
    Property

We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio, including,
    as of February 1, 2010, ownership of, or exclusive licenses
    to, 159 issued U.S. patents and 171 pending
    U.S. patent applications, including eight allowed
    applications that have not yet issued as patents. Our issued
    patents include those directed to various aspects of our arrays,
    assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing technology, instruments, and
    chemical detection technologies, and have terms that expire
    between 2010 and 2027. We continue to file new patent
    applications to protect the full range of our technologies. We
    have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these
    patents and applications in foreign countries.

We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, copyright, and
    trademark protection, as well as continuing technological
    innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
    our competitive position. Our success will depend in part on our
    ability to obtain patent protection for our products and
    processes, to preserve our trade secrets, to enforce our
    patents, copyrights and trademarks, to operate without
    infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and to
    acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products.

We are party to various exclusive and non-exclusive license
    agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant
    us rights to use key aspects of our array and sequencing
    technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent
    kits, and scanning equipment. We have exclusive licenses from
    Tufts University to patents that are directed to our BeadArray
    technology. These patents were filed by Dr. David Walt, who
    is a member of our board of directors, the Chairman of our
    Scientific Advisory Board, and one of our founders. Our
    exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying
    patents, which will occur between 2010 and 2020. We have
    additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third
    parties for other components of our products. In most cases, the
    agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying
    patents, may be terminated at our request without further
    obligation, and require that we pay customary royalties while
    the agreement is in effect.

Research
    and Development

We have made substantial investments in research and development
    since our inception. We have assembled a team of skilled
    engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology,
    chemistry, informatics, instrumentation, optical systems,
    software, manufacturing, and other related areas required to
    complete the development of our products. Our research and
    development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required
    to optimize our sequencing, BeadArray, VeraCode, and oligo
    synthesis technologies and to support commercialization of the
    products and services derived from these technologies.

Our research and development expenses for 2009, 2008, and 2007
    were $140.6 million, $100.0 million, and
    $73.9 million, respectively. We expect research and
    development expense to increase during 2010 as we continue to
    expand our research and product development efforts.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our current products address the genetic analysis portion of the
    life sciences market, in particular, experiments involving
    sequencing, SNP genotyping, and gene expression profiling. These
    experiments may be



involved in many areas of biologic research, including basic
    human disease research, pharmaceutical drug discovery and
    development, pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and agricultural
    research. Our potential customers include pharmaceutical,
    biotechnology, agrichemical, diagnostics, and consumer products
    companies, as well as academic or private research centers. The
    genetic analysis market is relatively new and emerging and its
    size and speed of development will ultimately be driven by,
    among other items:

•

the ability of the research community to extract medically
    valuable information from genomics and to apply that knowledge
    to multiple areas of disease-related research and treatment;

•

the availability of sufficiently low cost, high-throughput
    research tools to enable the large amount of experimentation
    required to study genetic variation and biological
    function; and

•

the availability of government and private industry funding to
    perform the research required to extract medically relevant
    information from genomic analysis.

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in
    North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. In each of
    these areas, we have dedicated sales, service, and application
    support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their
    respective customer bases. In addition, in certain markets
    within Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and
    South Africa we sell our products and provide services to
    customers through distributors that specialize in life science
    products. We expect to continue to increase our sales and
    distribution resources during 2010 and beyond as we launch a
    number of new products and expand the number of customers that
    can use our products.

Manufacturing

We manufacture sequencing and array instrument platforms,
    reagent kits, scanning equipment, and oligos. Our manufacturing
    capacity for consumables and instruments has grown during 2009
    to support our increased customer demand. We are also focused on
    continuing to enhance the quality and manufacturing yield of our
    BeadChips and flow cells. To continue to increase throughput and
    improve the quality and manufacturing yield as we increase the
    complexity of our products, we are exploring ways to continue
    increasing the level of automation in the manufacturing process.
    We adhere to access and safety standards required by federal,
    state, and local health ordinances, such as standards for the
    use, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances.

Raw
    Materials

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw
    materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and
    biochemical materials, and other supplies. We have multiple
    commercial sources for many of our components and supplies;
    however, there are some raw materials we obtain from single
    source suppliers. To mitigate potential risks arising from
    single source suppliers, we believe that we can redesign our
    products for alternative components or use alternative reagents.
    In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at
    minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as
    circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.

Competition

Although we expect that our products and services will provide
    significant advantages over products and services currently
    available from other sources, we expect to encounter intense
    competition from other companies that offer products and
    services for the sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression,
    and molecular diagnostics markets. These include companies such
    as Affymetrix, Inc.; Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Beckman
    Coulter, Inc.; Complete Genomics, Inc.; General Electric
    Company; Helicos BioSciences Corporation; Life Technologies
    Corporation; Luminex Corporation; Pacific Biosciences, Inc.;
    Roche Diagnostics Corp.; Sequenom, Inc.; and Qiagen N.V. Some of
    these companies have or will have substantially greater
    financial, technical, research, and other resources and larger,
    more established marketing, sales, distribution, and service
    organizations than we do. In addition, they may have greater
    name recognition than we do in the markets we address and in
    some cases a larger installed base of systems. Each of these
    markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to
    emerge and the intensity of competition to increase. In



order to effectively compete with these companies, we will need
    to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost,
    and accuracy advantages over competing products.

Segment
    and Geographic Information

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into two newly created business segments, Life
    Sciences and Diagnostics. Our Life Sciences Business Unit
    includes all products and services that are primarily related to
    the research market, namely the product lines based on our
    sequencing, BeadArray, and VeraCode technologies, and our
    Diagnostics Business Unit focuses on the emerging opportunity in
    molecular diagnostics. During 2009, we had limited activity
    related to the Diagnostics Business Unit and operating results
    were reported on an aggregate basis to our chief operating
    decision maker, the chief executive officer. Accordingly, we
    operated in one reportable segment during 2009.

We currently sell our products to a number of customers outside
    the United States, including customers in other areas of North
    America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Shipments to
    customers outside the United States totaled $319.1 million,
    or 48% of our total revenue, during 2009, compared to
    $293.2 million, or 51%, and $159.1 million, or 43%, in
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Sales to customers outside of the
    United States were generally denominated in U.S. dollars.
    In 2008, we reorganized our international structure to establish
    more efficient channels among product development, product
    manufacturing, and sales. The reorganization increased our
    foreign subsidiaries’ anticipated dependence on the
    U.S. entity for management decisions, financial support,
    production assets, and inventory thereby making the foreign
    subsidiaries more of a direct and integral component of the
    U.S. entity’s operations. As a result, we reassessed
    the primary economic environment of our foreign subsidiaries and
    determined the subsidiaries are more U.S. dollar based,
    resulting in a U.S. dollar functional currency
    determination. We expect that sales to international customers
    will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue.
    See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information concerning our foreign and
    domestic operations.

Backlog

Our backlog was $227.6 million and $113.0 million at
    January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively.
    Generally, our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as
    of the balance sheet date; however, we may allow customers to
    make product substitutions as we launch new products. The timing
    of shipments depends on several factors including, agreed upon
    shipping schedules, which may span multiple quarters, and
    whether the product is catalog or custom. We reasonably expect
    an estimated 90% of the backlog as of January 3, 2010 to be
    shipped within the fiscal year ending January 2, 2011.
    Although we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment
    and transfer of title to a customer, we may be required to defer
    the recognition of revenue even after shipment depending on the
    specific arrangement with a customer and the applicable
    accounting treatment. A material portion of our backlog at
    January 3, 2010 is associated with a large order we
    received from one customer for which we anticipate using
    operating lease accounting that will require us to recognize
    revenue over a period of three years with the majority of that
    revenue recognized in 2011 and 2012.

Seasonality

Historically, customer purchasing patterns have not shown
    significant seasonal variation, although demand for our products
    is usually lowest in the first quarter of the calendar year and
    highest in the third quarter of the calendar year as a result,
    in part, of U.S. academic customers spending unused budget
    allocations before the end of the U.S. government’s
    fiscal year.

Environmental
    Matters

We are committed to the protection of our employees and the
    environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous
    materials that subject us to a variety of federal, state, and
    local environmental and safety laws and regulations. We believe
    we are in material compliance, in all material respects, with
    current applicable laws and regulations; however, we could be
    held liable for damages and fines should contamination



of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous
    substances occur. In addition, we cannot predict how changes in
    these laws and regulations, or the development of new laws and
    regulations, will affect our business operations or the cost of
    compliance.

Government
    Regulation

Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or
    approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis
    of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass
    products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of
    disease, such as molecular diagnostic products, regulation by
    governmental authorities in the United States and other
    countries will be a significant factor in the development,
    testing, production, and marketing of such products. Products
    that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending
    on their intended use, will be regulated as medical devices by
    the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries and may
    require either receiving clearance following a pre-market
    notification process, also known as a 510(k) clearance, or
    premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA prior to marketing.
    Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive
    and may involve considerable delay.

The shorter 510(k) clearance process, which generally takes from
    three to six months after submission, but can take significantly
    longer, may be utilized if it is demonstrated that the new
    product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar
    product that has already been cleared by the FDA. The longer PMA
    process is much more costly, uncertain, and generally takes from
    nine months to two years after filing. Because we cannot assure
    you that any molecular diagnostic products that we develop will
    be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, or will
    ultimately be approved at all, the regulatory approval process
    for such products may be significantly delayed and may be
    significantly more expensive than anticipated. If we fail to
    obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining,
    regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we
    develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully
    commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.

Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the
    imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any
    time during the development or marketing of our products, which
    may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or
    comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.

In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process
    required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and
    future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled
    as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such
    products are used or could be used, even without our consent,
    for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory
    authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to
    regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Employees

As of January 3, 2010, we had a total of
    1,781 employees. None of our employees are represented by a
    labor union. We consider our employee relations to be positive.
    Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to
    attract and retain employees. In addition, we employ a number of
    temporary and contract employees. We face competition in this
    regard from other companies, research and academic institutions,
    government entities, and other organizations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to various risks, including those
    described below. In addition to the other information included
    in this

Form 10-K,

the following issues could adversely affect our operating
    results or our stock price.

We
    face intense competition, which could render our products
    obsolete, result in significant price reductions, or
    substantially limit the volume of products that we
    sell.

We compete with life sciences companies that design,
    manufacture, and market products for analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function and other applications using a
    wide-range of competing technologies. We anticipate that we will
    continue to face increased competition as existing companies
    develop new or



improved products and as new companies enter the market with new
    technologies. One or more of our competitors may render our
    technology obsolete or uneconomical. Some of our competitors
    have greater financial and personnel resources, broader product
    lines, a more established customer base, and more experience in
    research and development than we do. Furthermore, life sciences
    and pharmaceutical companies, which are our potential customers
    and strategic partners, could also develop competing products.
    We believe that customers in our markets display a significant
    amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular
    product; therefore, it may be difficult to generate sales to
    potential customers who have purchased products from
    competitors. To the extent we are unable to be the first to
    develop or supply new products, our competitive position may
    suffer.

The market for molecular diagnostics products is currently
    limited and highly competitive, with several large companies
    already having significant market share, intellectual property
    portfolios, and regulatory expertise. Established diagnostic
    companies also have an installed base of instruments in several
    markets, including clinical and reference laboratories, which
    could deter acceptance of our products. In addition, some of
    these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies
    that provide them access to genetic information that may be
    incorporated into their diagnostic tests.

Our
    success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of
    markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological
    function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life
    sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries. The
    usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the
    availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying
    or treating disease. We are focusing on markets for analysis of
    genetic variation and biological function, namely sequencing,
    genotyping, and gene expression profiling. These markets are new
    and emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we
    anticipate, or reach their full potential. Other methods of
    analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge
    and displace the methods we are developing. Also, researchers
    may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into
    medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic
    variation and biological function. For instance, demand for our
    microarray products may be adversely affected if researchers
    fail to find meaningful correlations between genetic variation,
    such as SNPs, and disease susceptibility through genome wide
    association studies. In addition, factors affecting research and
    development spending generally, such as changes in the
    regulatory environment affecting life sciences and
    pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs
    that provide funding to companies and research institutions,
    could harm our business. If useful genetic data is not available
    or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner,
    demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we
    expect, and we may not be able to sustain profitability.

If the
    quality of our products does not meet our customers’
    expectations, then our sales and operating earnings, and
    ultimately our reputation, could be negatively
    impacted.

In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately
    address quality issues associated with our products and
    services, including defects in our engineering, design, and
    manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party
    components included in our products. Because our instruments and
    reagents are highly complex, the occurrence of defects may
    increase as we continue to introduce new products and services.
    Although we have established internal procedures to minimize
    risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be
    no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate
    occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. In
    addition, identifying the root cause of quality issues,
    particularly those affecting reagents, may be difficult, which
    increases the time needed to address quality issues as they
    arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur.
    Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and we may
    incur significant costs or lost revenue in connection with, for
    example, shipment holds, product recalls, and warranty or other
    service obligations. In addition, quality issues can impair our
    relationships with new or existing customers and adversely
    affect our brand image, and our reputation as a producer of high
    quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our
    business as well as our financial results.



If we
    do not successfully manage the development and launch of new
    products or services, including product transitions, our
    financial results could be adversely affected.

We face risks associated with launching new products and
    pre-announcing products and services when the products or
    services have not been fully developed or tested. If our
    products and services are not able to deliver the performance or
    results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a
    timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer. If we
    encounter development challenges or discover errors in our
    products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay
    our product launch date. In addition, we may experience
    difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions,
    purchasing decisions, or transition requirements or programs
    (such as trade-in programs) with respect to newly launched
    products (or products in development) relative to our existing
    products, which could adversely affect sales of our existing
    products. The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful
    product development or launch activities or lack of market
    acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition, or results of operations.

If we
    are unable to increase our manufacturing capacity and develop
    and maintain operation of our manufacturing capability, we may
    not be able to launch or support our products in a timely
    manner, or at all.

We continue to increase our capacity to meet the anticipated
    demand for our products. Although we have significantly
    increased our manufacturing capacity and we believe we have
    plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to
    meet our business plan for 2010, there are uncertainties
    inherent in expanding our manufacturing capabilities and we may
    not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely
    manner. For example, manufacturing and product quality issues
    may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing
    facilities and launch new products. Also, we may not manufacture
    the right product mix to meet customer demand, especially as we
    introduce new products. As a result, we may experience
    difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator, and internal
    demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to
    delay new product introductions, and demand for our products
    could decline. Additionally, in the past, we have experienced
    variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control
    issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of
    certain products. Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing
    products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or
    previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that
    could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability
    to launch or sell these products (or to produce them
    economically), prevent us from achieving expected performance
    levels, or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by
    customers.

Additionally, we currently manufacture in a limited number of
    locations. Our manufacturing facilities are located in
    San Diego and Hayward, California; Singapore; and Little
    Chesterford, United Kingdom. These areas are subject to natural
    disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods. If a
    natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities
    significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to
    fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our
    services or develop new products.

Also, many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are
    controlled by our custom-designed Laboratory Information
    Management System (LIMS). Additionally, the decoding process in
    our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage
    infrastructure. If either our LIMS system or our networks or
    storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of
    time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our
    products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving
    our expected shipments in any given period.

Our
    acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
    business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions of businesses or technologies.

As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products,
    services, and technologies, we have made, and may continue to
    make, acquisitions of technologies, products, or businesses.
    Acquisitions involve



numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial
    challenges, including the following, any of which could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results
    of operations:

•

difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies,
    products, and personnel;

•

lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies
    and cost-savings;

•

difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;

•

underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or
    business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;

•

negative near-term impacts on financial results after an
    acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;

•

the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic
    partners of acquired companies;

•

claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired
    companies or other third parties related to the transaction;

•

the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of
    additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial
    portions of our cash;

•

diversion of management’s attention and company resources
    from existing operations of the business;

•

inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;

•

the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological
    advancements, or

worse-than-expected

performance of acquired companies; and

•

assumption of, or exposure to, unknown contingent liabilities or
    liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately
    quantify.

In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses
    requires significant efforts and expense across all operational
    areas, including sales and marketing, research and development,
    manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies. We
    cannot assure you that any of the acquisitions we make will be
    successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure
    to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from
    achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a
    reasonable time frame, or at all.

The
    timing and extent of funding provided by the American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act) could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition, or results of
    operations.

The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide
    stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic
    downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over
    $10 billion in funding was provided to the National
    Institute of Health through September 2010 to support the
    advancement of scientific research. A portion of the stimulus
    funding may support the analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function and have a significant positive impact on
    our business. In the short-term, however, our customers may
    delay or reduce their purchases of our products as they wait to
    learn whether, and to what extent, they will receive stimulus
    funding. If our customers are unable to obtain stimulus money
    they may reduce their research and development budgets resulting
    in a decrease in demand for our products. In addition, it is
    unclear what will happen to demand for our products after the
    stimulus funds from the Recovery Act have been allocated and
    spent. A decline in demand will reduce our revenues, which would
    adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results
    of operations.

Unfavorable
    global economic conditions could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general
    conditions in the global economy and in the global financial
    markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme
    volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A
    severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global
    financial



crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business,
    including, in particular, reductions or delays in planned
    improvements to healthcare systems, research and development
    funding, and purchases of our products and services, or
    cost-containment efforts by governments and private
    organizations that could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, the
    liquidity of our investment portfolio could be impaired such as
    when more than $50 million of auction rate securities that
    we held for investment became illiquid in February 2008 because
    their scheduled auctions failed. Furthermore, as is the case for
    almost any other business, we face the following risks from a
    severe or prolonged economic downturn:

•

severely limited access to financing over an extended period of
    time, which may limit our ability to fund our growth strategy,
    could result in a need to delay capital expenditures,
    acquisitions, or research and development projects;

•

losses from our investment portfolio or to a counterparty’s
    inability to fulfill its payment obligations;

•

inability to refinance existing debt at competitive rates,
    reasonable terms, or sufficient amounts; and

•

increased volatility or adverse movements in foreign currency
    exchange rates.

In addition, certain of our customers may face challenges
    gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result
    in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us.
    If that were to occur, our allowance for doubtful accounts and
    our days sales outstanding could increase. Additionally, these
    economic conditions may cause our smaller suppliers to be unable
    to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized
    components, which would impair our ability to manufacture on
    schedule and at commercially reasonable costs. Suppliers may
    also extend lead times, limit supplies, or increase prices due
    to capacity constraints or other factors.

Our
    continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and
    commercializing new products.

Our target markets are characterized by rapid technological
    change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs,
    existing and emerging competition, strong price competition, and
    frequent new product introductions. Accordingly, our continued
    growth depends on continuously developing and commercializing
    new products and services, including improving our existing
    products and services, in order to address evolving market
    requirements on a timely basis. If we fail to innovate or
    adequately invest in new technologies, our products and services
    will become dated and we could lose our competitive position in
    the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products
    offered by our competitors. We believe that successfully
    introducing new products and technologies in our target markets
    on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage
    because customers make an investment of time in selecting and
    learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch
    once that selection is made.

To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative
    products, or such products are not accepted in the market or
    suffer significant delays in development, we may lose market
    share to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible
    to regain. An inability, for technological or other reasons, to
    successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our
    growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.
    In the past, we have experienced, and are likely to experience
    in the future, delays in the development and introduction of new
    products. We cannot assure you that we will keep pace with the
    rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products
    will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace,
    achieve market acceptance, or compete successfully with
    competing technologies. Some of the factors affecting market
    acceptance of new products and services include:

•

availability, quality, and price relative to competing products
    and services;

•

the functionality of new and existing products and services;

•

the timing of introduction of the new product or service
    relative to competing products and services;

•

scientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of
    the new product or service;

•

citation of the new product or service in published research;



•

regulatory trends and approvals; and

•

general trends in life sciences research and applied markets.

We
    depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components
    and materials used in our products, and if shipments from these
    manufacturers or suppliers are delayed or interrupted, or if the
    quality of the components or materials supplied do not meet our
    requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship
    our products in a timely manner, or at all.

The nature of our products requires customized components and
    materials that currently are available from a limited number of
    sources, and, in the case of some components and materials, from
    only a single source. If deliveries from these vendors are
    delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if we are otherwise
    unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may not be able to
    obtain these components or materials timely or in sufficient
    quantities or qualities, or at all, in order to meet demand for
    our products. We may need to enter into contractual
    relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production
    of some of our products, or develop these capabilities
    internally, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do
    this on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or on
    commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, we may not be able
    to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at
    commercially reasonable costs. In addition, the manufacture or
    shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the
    quality of the components or materials supplied by our vendors
    does not meet our requirements. Any delay or interruption to our
    manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result
    in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

An
    inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our
    operations could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

Our business has grown rapidly, with total revenues increasing
    from $73.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2006
    to $666.3 million for the year ended January 3, 2010
    and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to 1,781
    during the same period. We expect to continue to experience
    rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating
    plans. The rapid expansion of our business and addition of new
    personnel may place a strain on our management and operational
    systems. Our ability to effectively manage our operations and
    growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our
    operational, financial, and management controls, reporting
    systems, and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient
    numbers of talented employees on a global basis. If we are
    unable to scale up and implement improvements to our
    manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or
    timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing
    systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available
    the products required to successfully commercialize our
    technology. Our future operating results will depend on the
    ability of our management to continue to implement and improve
    our research, product development, manufacturing, sales and
    marketing, and customer support programs, enhance our
    operational and financial control systems, expand, train, and
    manage our employee base, integrate acquired businesses, and
    effectively address new issues related to our growth as they
    arise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage
    our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully,
    and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations.

If we
    lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain
    additional personnel, we may be unable to achieve our
    goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific
    personnel, including Jay Flatley, our president and chief
    executive officer. The loss of their services could adversely
    impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. In
    addition, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel
    with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological
    information processing, sales, marketing, and technical support.
    We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel
    with other life science companies, universities, and research
    institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.
    Competition for these individuals, particularly in the
    San Diego and San Francisco area, is intense, and the
    turnover rate can be high. Failure to attract and retain
    management and scientific personnel would prevent us from
    pursuing collaborations or developing our



products or technologies. Additionally, integration of acquired
    companies and businesses can be disruptive, causing key
    employees of the acquired business to leave. Further, we use
    stock options and restricted stock to provide incentives for our
    key personnel to remain with us and to align their interests
    with those of the Company by building long-term stockholder
    value. If our stock price decreases, the value of these equity
    awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s
    incentive to stay.

Doing
    business internationally creates operational and financial risks
    for our business.

Conducting and launching operations on an international scale
    requires close coordination of activities across multiple
    jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management
    resources. If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities
    effectively, including the risks noted below, our business,
    financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely
    affected. We are focused on expanding our international
    operations in key markets. We have sales offices located
    internationally throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,
    as well as manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and
    Singapore. During 2009, the majority of our sales to
    international customers and purchases of raw materials from
    international suppliers were denominated in U.S. dollars.
    Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 48%,
    51%, and 43% of our total revenue for the years ended
    January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008, and
    December 30, 2007, respectively. We intend to continue to
    expand our international presence by selling to customers
    located outside of the United States and we expect the total
    amount of

non-U.S. sales

to continue to grow.

International sales entail a variety of risks, including:

•

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts
    receivable outside of the United States;

•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of
    foreign countries into which we sell our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other
    trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery
    delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety
    of foreign laws.

Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the
    cost of certain items required in our operations. Changes in
    currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at
    which we are able sell products in the same market. Our revenues
    from international customers may be negatively impacted as
    increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international
    customers local currency could make our products more expensive,
    impacting our ability to compete. Our costs of materials from
    international suppliers may increase if in order to continue
    doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of
    the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency.
    Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could
    result in actions by the United States and other countries to
    offset the effects of such fluctuations. The recent global
    financial downturn has led to a high level of volatility in
    foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may
    continue, which could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations.

We are
    subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions
    and the possible loss of the tax deduction on our outstanding
    convertible notes.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments based on
    interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required
    in determining the provision for income taxes. Our effective
    income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors,
    including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in
    tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
    existing tax laws or tax rates,



changes in the level of non-deductible expenses (including
    share-based compensation), changes in our future levels of
    research and development spending, mergers and acquisitions, or
    the result of examinations by various tax authorities.

In addition, we could lose some or all of the tax deduction for
    interest expense associated with our $400 million aggregate
    principal amount of convertible notes due in 2014 if these notes
    are not subject to the special Treasury Regulations governing
    contingent payment debt instruments, the notes are converted, or
    we invest in non-taxable investments.

Any
    inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies
    could harm our competitive position.

Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop
    proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and
    maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the
    United States and other countries. If we do not protect our
    intellectual property adequately, competitors may be able to use
    our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage.
    The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary
    rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and
    many companies have encountered significant challenges in
    establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of
    the United States. These challenges can be caused by the absence
    of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of
    intellectual property rights outside of the United States.

The patent positions of companies developing tools for the life
    sciences, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries, including
    our patent position, generally are uncertain and involve complex
    legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our
    proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only
    to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by
    valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as
    trade secrets. In addition, patent applications in the United
    States may be maintained in secrecy until patents issue, and
    publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent
    literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several
    months. We intend to apply for patents covering our technologies
    and products as we deem appropriate. However, our patent
    applications may be challenged and may not result in issued
    patents or may be invalidated or narrowed in scope after they
    are issued. Questions as to inventorship or ownership may also
    arise. Any finding that our patents or applications are
    unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from
    practicing the related technology, and a finding that others
    have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and
    applications could require us to obtain certain rights to
    practice related technologies, which may not be available on
    favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, as issued patents
    expire, we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop
    competing products, and, as a result, we may lose revenue.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we
    obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from
    practicing our technologies or from developing competing
    products. There is also the risk that others may independently
    develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our
    patented technologies. Also, our patents may fail to provide us
    with any competitive advantage. We may need to initiate lawsuits
    to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third
    party claims, which would be expensive, and, if we lose, may
    cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and
    reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore,
    these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel.

We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how
    protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and
    we have taken security measures to protect this information.
    These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for
    our trade secrets, know-how, or other confidential information.
    Among other things, we seek to protect our trade secrets and
    confidential information by entering into confidentiality
    agreements with employees, collaborators, and consultants. There
    can be no assurance that any confidentiality agreements that we
    have with our employees, collaborators, and consultants will
    provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and
    confidential information or will provide adequate remedies in
    the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
    Accordingly, there also can be no assurance that our trade
    secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently
    developed by competitors.



Litigation,
    other proceedings, or third party claims of intellectual
    property infringement could require us to spend significant time
    and money and could prevent us from selling our products or
    services.

Our success depends, in part, on our non-infringement of the
    patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties
    have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing
    their proprietary technology without authorization. As we enter
    new markets, we expect that competitors will likely claim that
    our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part
    of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those
    markets. In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in
    the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of
    our technologies infringes these patents. We could incur
    substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and
    technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these
    claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in
    defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse
    impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the
    actual import of the ruling itself. Furthermore, parties making
    claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other
    relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop
    further, commercialize, or sell products, and could result in
    the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a
    successful infringement claim against us, we may be required to
    pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties,
    or be prohibited from selling certain products. In addition, we
    may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if
    at all. We could therefore incur substantial costs related to
    royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which
    could negatively affect our gross margins. In addition, we could
    encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to
    develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit
    or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms
    could prevent us from commercializing products, and the
    prohibition of sale of any of our products could adversely
    affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability.

Our
    products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject
    to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and
    maintenance process for such products may be expensive,
    time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in
    outcome.

Our products are not currently subject to FDA clearance or
    approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis
    of disease. However, as we expand our product line to encompass
    products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of
    disease, certain of our products are likely to become subject to
    regulation by the FDA, or comparable agencies of other
    countries, including requirements for regulatory approval of
    such products before they can be marketed. Such regulatory
    approval processes or clearances may be expensive,
    time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or
    comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition, or operating
    results. In addition, changes to the current regulatory
    framework, including the imposition of additional or new
    regulations, could arise at any time during the development or
    marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our
    ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory
    approval of our products, if required.

Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their
    intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and
    comparable agencies of other countries and may require either
    receiving clearance from the FDA following a pre-market
    notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each
    case prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory
    approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.
    If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in
    obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic
    products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or
    successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or
    at all.

In addition, the regulatory approval or clearance process
    required to manufacture, market, and sell our existing and
    future products that are intended for, and marketed and labeled
    as, “Research Use Only,” or RUO, is uncertain if such
    products are used or could be used, even without our consent,
    for the diagnosis of disease. If the FDA or other regulatory
    authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to
    regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial
    condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.



Our
    operating results may vary significantly from period to period,
    and we may not be able to sustain operating
    profitability.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of
    sales of high-value products and services, the effects of new
    product launches and related promotions, the impact of seasonal
    spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our
    customers perform, the timing of our customers’ funding,
    changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences
    industry, and other unpredictable factors that may affect
    customer ordering patterns. Given the difficulty in predicting
    the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services,
    we may experience

quarter-to-quarter

fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a
    sequential decline in quarterly revenue. While we anticipate
    future growth, there is some uncertainty as to the timing of
    revenue recognition on a quarterly basis. This is because a
    substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically
    recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the
    pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not
    linear, with a concentration of orders in the final week of the
    quarter. In light of that, our revenue cut-off and recognition
    procedures, together with our manufacturing and shipping
    operations, may experience increased pressure and demand during
    the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter.

A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed, including
    expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel. In addition,
    we expect operating expenses to continue to increase
    significantly in absolute dollars, and we expect that our
    research and development and selling and marketing expenses will
    increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the
    development and launch of new products. Accordingly, our ability
    to sustain profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of
    growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses,
    and if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able
    to maintain annual or quarterly profitability. Any significant
    delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable
    sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the
    other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future
    revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly
    revenue. In addition, non-cash stock-based compensation expense
    and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also
    likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability.
    Due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our
    revenue and expenses, particularly from quarter to quarter, we
    believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are
    not a good indication of our future performance. If our
    operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of
    stock market analysts and investors, our stock price could
    decline.

From time to time, we receive large orders that have a
    significant effect on our operating results in the period in
    which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such
    orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue
    recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes
    in net sales. As a result, our operating results could vary
    materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such
    orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.

Changes
    in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates,
    and judgments by management related to complex accounting
    matters could significantly affect our financial results or
    financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting
    pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations
    with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our
    business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair
    value determinations, inventories, business combinations and
    intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex
    and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and
    judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or
    changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could
    significantly change our reported or expected financial
    performance or financial condition. In addition, the timing of
    large orders can have a significant effect on our business and
    operating results from quarter to quarter.

Ethical,
    legal, and social concerns related to the use of genetic
    information could reduce demand for our products or
    services.

Genetic testing has raised ethical, legal, and social issues
    regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting
    information. Governmental authorities could, for social or other
    purposes, call for limits on or



regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for
    genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for
    those that have no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead
    individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible.
    These and other ethical, legal, and social concerns about
    genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology
    for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our
    technology, either of which could have an adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition, or results of operations.

    Performance Graph

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder
    returns on our common stock for the last five fiscal years with
    the cumulative total stockholder returns on the NASDAQ Composite
    Index and the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for the same period.
    The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31,
    2004 in our common stock and in each index and that all
    dividends were reinvested. No cash dividends have been declared
    on our common stock. Stockholder returns over the indicated
    period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder
    returns.

Holders

As of February 5, 2010 we had 400 record holders of our
    common stock.

Dividends

We have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention
    to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition,
    the indenture for our convertible senior notes due 2014, which
    are convertible into cash



and, in certain circumstances, shares of our common stock,
    requires us to increase the conversion rate applicable to the
    notes if we pay any cash dividends.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities by the Issuer

In July 2009, our board of directors authorized a
    $75 million stock repurchase program and concurrently
    terminated a $120 million stock repurchase program
    authorized by our board of directors in October 2008, under
    which we had purchased stock totaling $70.8 million in
    2008. In November 2009, upon the completion of the repurchase
    plan authorized in July 2009, our board of directors authorized
    an additional $100 million stock repurchase program, which
    was completed in December 2009. The following table summarizes
    shares repurchased pursuant to these programs during the quarter

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Certain statements set forth below constitute forward-looking
    statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
    Statements” for additional factors relating to such
    statements, and see “Risk Factors” in



Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk
    factors applicable to our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Business
    Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of
    integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and
    biological function. Using our proprietary technologies, we
    provide a comprehensive line of products and services that
    currently serve the sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression
    markets, and we expect to enter the market for molecular
    diagnostics. Our customers include leading genomic research
    centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions,
    clinical research organizations, and biotechnology companies.

We develop and commercialize sequencing technologies used to
    perform a range of analyses, including de novo sequencing, whole
    genome re-sequencing, gene expression analysis, and small RNA
    analysis. Our product and service offerings also include
    leading-edge solutions for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
    genotyping, copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation
    studies, gene expression profiling, and low-multiplex analysis
    of DNA, RNA, and protein. We believe we are the only company
    with genome-scale technology for sequencing, genotyping, and
    gene expression — the three cornerstones of modern
    genetic analysis.

Our tools provide researchers around the world with the
    performance, throughput, cost effectiveness, and flexibility
    necessary to determine and analyze the billions of bits of
    genetic information needed to extract valuable medical
    information from advances in genomics and proteomics. We believe
    this information will enable researchers to correlate genetic
    variation and biological function, which will enhance drug
    discovery and clinical research, allow diseases to be detected
    earlier, and permit better choices of drugs for individual
    patients.

During the first quarter of 2008, we reorganized our operating
    structure into a newly created Life Sciences Business Unit,
    which includes all products and services that are primarily
    related to the research market, namely those based on our
    sequencing, BeadArray and Veracode technologies. We also created
    a Diagnostics Business Unit to focus on the emerging opportunity
    in molecular diagnostics. For the year ended January 3,
    2010, we had limited activity related to the Diagnostics
    Business Unit and operating results were reported on an
    aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker, the chief
    executive officer. Accordingly, we operated in one segment for
    the year ended January 3, 2010. We will begin reporting in
    two segments once revenues, operating profit or loss, or assets
    of the Diagnostics Business Unit exceed 10% of the consolidated
    amounts.

Our analysis presented below is organized to provide the
    information we believe will be useful for understanding the
    relevant trends going forward. However, this discussion should
    be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
    statements and the notes thereto in Item 15 of this report.

Business
    Trends and Outlook

Our financial results have been, and will continue to be,
    impacted by several significant trends, which are described
    below:

Next
    Generation Sequencing

Strong demand for next generation sequencing applications
    continues to drive both sequencing instrument and consumable
    sales. In 2009 we made advances to our sequencing technology,
    including enhanced chemistry, algorithms, and hardware which
    substantially improved accuracy, read length, data density, and
    ease of use. The combination of these advances increased the
    output and decreased the cost of sequencing and expanded the
    number of applications that researchers can perform on our
    sequencing systems. In early 2010 we expect to begin customer
    shipments of our recently announced HiSeq 2000 next generation
    sequencing instrument, which we believe will allow customers to
    sequence whole human genomes for less than $10,000 in reagent
    costs. We anticipate our revenue for 2010 will have higher
    growth in the second half of the year



compared to the first half due to the timing of the
    manufacturing

scale-up

of
    the HiSeq 2000 and other significant product launches scheduled
    for later in the year. We believe that as the cost of next
    generation sequencing continues to decline, the number of
    samples available for sequencing will significantly increase.

Genome
    Wide Association Studies (GWAS)

We experienced a slowdown in the sales of our microarray
    products during 2009 that was largely attributable to
    researchers reducing or suspending the initiation of new studies
    as they waited for rare variant content emerging from the 1000
    Genomes Project, an international research effort launched in
    2008 to establish the most detailed catalog of human genetic
    variation. Despite advances in sequencing technology, we believe
    microarrays remain a cheaper, faster and materially more
    accurate technology for use when genetic content is known. The
    information content of specific microarrays is fixed and
    reproducible; as such, specific microarrays provide repeatable,
    standardized assays for certain subsets of bases within the
    overall genome. During 2010, as part of our previously announced
    GWAS roadmap, we plan to launch arrays that will feature
    millions of more markers per BeadChip and new rare variant
    content from the 1000 Genomes Project. As these arrays become
    available, we believe activity in the microarray market will
    increase relative to 2009.

American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery
    Act)

The Recovery Act was enacted in February 2009 to provide
    stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic
    downturn. As part of the Recovery Act legislation, over
    $10 billion in funding was provided to the National
    Institute of Health (NIH) through September 2010 to support the
    advancement of scientific research. In the second and third
    quarters of 2009 we experienced negative unintended consequences
    of the Recovery Act as customers delayed orders while they
    waited to receive stimulus funds. During the fourth quarter of
    2009, we believe we saw an increase in the distribution of
    Recovery Act funds and received an estimated $16 million in
    orders directly related to Recovery Act grants. We believe a
    significant portion of Recovery Act awards may be distributed in
    2010, which may create a pipeline of opportunity in the upcoming
    year.

Life
    Science Research Funding Across Regional Markets

We have developed a broad sales and distribution network with a
    sales presence in more than 40 countries. Our financial results
    will continue to be impacted by significant regional trends in
    life science research funding as described below:

•

United States.

A significant increase to the
    NIH budget in addition to Recovery Act stimulus funds has made
    for a strong funding environment in the United States that we
    expect to continue into 2010.

•

Asia-Pacific.

Strong funding in China was
    partially offset by a funding decrease in Japan due to a change
    in government that resulted in the suspension of supplemental
    life science research funding during the second and third
    quarters of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we saw an
    increase in activity in the Japanese market as funds began to be
    released, which we expect to continue into 2010.

•

Europe.

Central and southern European markets
    had a strong year driven by the establishment and expansion of
    genome centers. However, there was a decrease in funding in
    northern European countries, primarily due to reduced
    institutional funding in areas like the United Kingdom and the
    financial crisis in Iceland. We saw some positive signs during
    the fourth quarter of 2009 in Northern Europe, and, although we
    expect funding to stabilize, we do not expect a material
    increase in activity in this region in 2010.

Cost
    of Revenue

Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue declined during
    2009 due to cost efficiencies in our manufacturing process and
    an improved mix of sequencing consumables driven by growth in
    the installed base of our sequencing systems. We expect changes
    in our product mix to continue to affect our cost of revenue as
    a percentage of revenue, particularly in the latter half of the
    year. We anticipate cost of revenue as a



percentage of revenue to be lower in the first half of the year
    and then increase as the mix shifts to newer products and the
    effects of our trade-in promotions associated with the launch of
    the HiSeq 2000 are realized. Additionally, we expect price
    competition to continue in our market causing added variability
    in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly
    and annual basis.

Operating
    Expense

We expect to incur additional operating costs to support the
    expected growth in our business. As a result of revenues growing
    faster in the second half of 2010, we expect operating expenses
    as a percentage of revenue to be higher in the first half of the
    year compared with the second half. We believe a substantial
    investment in research and development is essential to remaining
    competitive and expanding into additional markets. Accordingly,
    we expect our research and development expenses to increase in
    absolute dollars as we expand our product base. Selling, general
    and administrative expenses are also expected to increase in
    absolute dollars as we continue to expand our staff and add
    sales and marketing infrastructure.

While these trends are important to understanding and evaluating
    our financial results, the other transactions, events and trends
    discussed in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this
    report may also materially impact our business operations and
    financial results.

Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of
    consumables and instruments.

Consumable revenue increased $57.6 million, or 17%, to
    $391.3 million for the year ended January 3, 2010
    compared to $333.7 million for the year ended
    December 28, 2008. Microarray consumable revenue, which
    constituted more than half of our consumable revenue, declined
    $11.4 million, or 4%, primarily attributable to lower sales
    of whole-genome genotyping arrays partially offset by growth in
    focused content arrays. The decline was driven by customers
    delaying the start of new GWAS in anticipation of new and rare
    variant content from the 1000 Genome Project, order delays
    directly related to stimulus funding under the Recovery Act and
    the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers.
    Sales volume for our Infinium BeadChip product lines, which
    constitute a majority of our microarray consumable sales, was
    relatively flat on a sample basis during 2009 compared to 2008.
    The average selling price per sample, however, declined due to a
    change in product mix attributable to growth in the sales of our
    focused content arrays coupled with lower sales of whole-genome
    genotyping arrays and an increase in the average number of
    samples per BeadChip.

Revenue from sequencing consumables increased
    $68.9 million, or 144%, driven by growth in the installed
    base of our Genome Analyzer systems and the progression of
    customer labs ramping to production scale. The increase was
    partially offset by a loss of sales related to a quality issue
    affecting our paired-end cluster kits that arose in September
    2009 when some of our larger sequencing customers began
    experiencing higher than average error rates on the second read
    of their paired-end analysis. During the fourth quarter, we
    began shipping reformulated paired-end cluster kits at full
    capacity and cleared the related shipping backlog.

Revenue from the sale of instruments increased
    $40.0 million, or 22%, to $225.7 million for the year
    ended January 3, 2010 compared to $185.7 million for
    the year ended December 28, 2008 primarily due to a
    $56.4 million, or 43%, increase in sales of our sequencing
    systems. During 2009 as compared to 2008 both units sold and
    average selling prices increased for our Genome Analyzer
    systems, which constitute a majority of sequencing instrument
    revenue. The increase in units sold was driven by increased
    demand for next generation sequencing and our

sequencing-by-synthesis

technology. The increase in average selling prices was
    attributable to the product transition from the Genome Analyzer
    I to the Genome Analyzer II in the second quarter of 2008
    and technological improvements leading to the launch of the
    Genome Analyzer IIx in the second quarter of 2009. The increase
    in sequencing instrument revenue was partially offset by a
    $16.4 million, or 30%, decrease in the sales of our
    microarray systems, which declined primarily due to customers
    delaying the start of new GWAS in anticipation of new and rare
    variant content from the 1000 Genomes Project, order delays
    directly related to stimulus funding under the Recovery Act and
    the impact of reduced foundation funding at a few key customers.

Total cost of revenue, which excludes the impairment of
    manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible
    assets, remained flat despite higher sales, primarily due to a
    decrease in manufacturing costs and improved efficiencies.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was
    30% for the year ended January 3, 2010, compared to 36% for
    the year ended December 28, 2008. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower costs for our sequencing consumables and
    instrumentation. The cost of sequencing consumables decreased as
    a percentage of related revenue due to improved overhead
    absorption from increased volumes and the benefit of decreased
    costs associated with the reformulation of our sequencing kits
    launched at the end of the third quarter of 2008. The cost of
    sequencing instruments decreased as a percentage of related
    revenue due to production efficiencies and reduced material
    costs coupled with higher average selling prices.

Interest income decreased despite an increase in our average
    cash and investment balance due to an overall decline in
    interest rates during 2009. Interest expense increased due to
    the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior
    notes. Other income, net decreased due to a decrease of
    $1.5 million in gains on net foreign currency transactions,
    which was partially offset by a gain of $0.8 million on the
    conversion of a portion of our debt during the first quarter of
    2009.

The increase in the provision for income taxes was attributable
    to the increase in the consolidated income before income taxes.
    The effective tax rate decreased from 45.8% in 2008 to 36.7% in
    2009 predominately because the amount of nondeductible acquired
    IPR&D recognized for financial reporting purposes was lower
    by $13.3 million. Additionally, the percentage of
    consolidated income before income taxes earned in foreign
    jurisdictions, which primarily have lower statutory tax rates
    than the U.S. statutory tax rate, increased from 36% in
    2008 to 43% in 2009.

Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of
    consumables and instruments.

Revenue from the sale of consumables increased
    $140.2 million, or 72%, to $333.7 million for the year
    ended December 28, 2008 compared to $193.5 million for
    the year ended December 30, 2007. Growth in consumable
    revenue was primarily attributable to strong demand for our
    Infinium and sequencing products, which led to increased sales
    of $104.8 million and $35.4 million, respectively. The
    increase in revenue associated with our Infinium products was
    attributable to the strong demand for our Infinium High-Density
    BeadChips, particularly the Human610-Quad, which we began
    shipping during the first quarter of 2008. Of the overall
    increase in Infinium BeadChip sales, approximately 79% was due
    to new product introductions with higher average selling prices,
    while the remaining 21% can be attributed to increased volume.
    The increase in sequencing consumables was primarily
    attributable to the growth of our installed base of instruments
    and the progression of customer labs ramping to production scale.

Revenue from the sale of instruments increased
    $64.8 million, or 54%, to $185.7 million for the year
    ended December 28, 2008 compared to $120.9 million for
    the year ended December 30, 2007. The increase was
    primarily attributable to a $63.0 million increase in sales
    of our Genome Analyzer driven by both an increase in sales
    volume and average selling prices. Additionally, during the
    second quarter of 2008, we launched the iScan System, our
    next-generation BeadChip scanner to replace the BeadArray
    Reader. Any increase in revenue resulting from shipments of this
    new system was offset by a reduction in sales of our BeadArray
    Reader as we stopped manufacturing this product upon the launch
    of our iScan System.

Total cost of revenue, which excludes the impairment of
    manufacturing equipment and the amortization of intangible
    assets, increased primarily due to higher instrument and
    consumable sales.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of related revenue was
    36% for the year ended December 28, 2008 compared to 37%
    for the year ended December 30, 2007. The decrease was
    primarily due to favorable product mix driven by increased sales
    of our new High-Density Infinium Beadchips, with higher average
    selling prices as compared to the Infinium Beadchips sold in the
    prior year. This was partially offset by increased provisions
    for inventory obsolescence of $7.2 million for the year
    ended December 28, 2008 compared to $1.9 million for
    the year ended December 30, 2007. The increase in the
    inventory reserve was primarily associated with product
    transitions. During the year, we recorded reserves for product
    obsolescence associated with the launch of our new Infinium
    Beadchips and the launch of a new sequencing kit. Instrument
    cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue increased
    slightly over the prior year due to lower average selling prices
    mainly associated with promotional campaigns as we launched our
    next generation Beadarray Reader, the iScan in the first half of
    2008.

    $72.3 million plus net non-cash adjustments of
    $113.5 million and an $11.3 million increase in net
    operating assets. The primary non-cash expenses added back to
    net income included share based compensation of
    $60.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense
    related to property and equipment, intangibles and the debt
    discount on our convertible notes totaling $51.5 million.
    The main drivers in the change in net operating assets included
    increases in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities. These increases were primarily related
    to the growth of our business.

Investing
    Activities

Cash used in investing activities totaled $255.7 million
    for the year ended January 3, 2010. We purchased and sold

available-for-sale

securities totaling $694.5 million and $515.2 million,
    respectively. We incurred $51.8 million in capital
    expenditures primarily associated with the expansion of our
    facilities and infrastructure at our San Diego, Hayward and
    UK locations. Additionally, in January 2009, we executed a
    strategic alliance with Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which
    consisted of a commercialization agreement and an
    $18.0 million equity investment. We also agreed to make an
    additional equity investment upon the achievement of a specific
    technical milestone.

In August 2008, we completed our acquisition of Avantome, Inc.
    As consideration for the acquisition, we paid $25.8 million
    in cash, including transaction costs, at the closing of the
    acquisition, and have subsequently paid $15.0 million as of
    February 1, 2010 based on the achievement of, or amendments
    relating to, certain milestones. We may pay up to an additional
    $20.0 million in contingent cash consideration to
    Avantome’s former shareholders based on the achievement of
    certain remaining milestones.

In January 2008, as part of our Affymetrix settlement, we
    recorded a $36.0 million intangible asset for licensed
    technology obtained in the settlement. See Note 4 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
    regarding intangible assets.

In January of 2007, we completed our acquisition of Solexa, Inc.
    in a

stock-for-stock

merger transaction. The Company issued approximately
    26.2 million shares of its common stock as consideration
    for this merger. The acquisition resulted in net cash acquired
    of $72.1 million.

Financing
    Activities

Cash used in financing activities totaled $98.9 million for
    the year ended January 3, 2010. During the year we
    repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of our common
    stock for $175.1 million, which was partially offset by
    $39.4 million in proceeds received from the exercise of
    stock options and the sale of shares under our Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan and $39.3 million of incremental tax benefits
    related to stock options exercised.



In August 2008, we issued a total of 8.1 million shares at
    a public offering price of $43.75 per share, raising net
    proceeds to the Company of $342.7 million, after deducting
    underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.
    During the year ended December 28, 2008, we also
    repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of our common
    stock for $70.8 million.

In February 2007, we issued $400.0 million principal amount
    of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds
    from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’
    discount and offering expenses, were approximately
    $390.3 million. We used $201.6 million of the net
    proceeds to purchase approximately 11.6 million shares of
    our common stock in privately negotiated transactions
    concurrently with the offering. We used $46.6 million of
    the net proceeds of this offering to pay the net cost of
    convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, which are
    designed to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the
    notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information regarding our convertible
    senior notes.

Liquidity

We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the
    primary source of our liquidity. Our ability to generate cash
    from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we
    need to meet operating, investing and financing needs.
    Historically, we have issued debt and equity securities to
    finance our requirements to the extent that cash provided by
    operating activities was not sufficient to fund our needs. We
    may require additional funding in the future and our failure to
    raise capital on acceptable terms, when needed, could have a
    material adverse effect on our business.

At January 3, 2010, we had approximately
    $693.5 million in cash and short-term investments.
    Short-term investments include marketable securities and auction
    rate securities totaling $494.0 million and
    $54.9 million, respectively. Our marketable securities
    consist of debt securities in government sponsored entities,
    corporate debt securities and U.S treasury notes. We do not hold
    securities backed by mortgages. Our auction rate securities were
    issued primarily by municipalities and universities. The markets
    for auction rate securities effectively ceased when the vast
    majority of auctions failed in February 2008, preventing
    investors from selling their auction rate securities. As of
    January 3, 2010, the securities continued to fail auction
    and remained illiquid. In November 2008, we signed a settlement
    agreement allowing us to sell our auction rate securities at par
    value to UBS AG (UBS) at our discretion during the period of
    June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Because we intend
    to exercise this right when it becomes available, we have
    classified our auction rate securities as short-term on the
    balance sheet. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding our
    auction rate securities.

Our outstanding convertible senior notes were convertible into
    cash and, if applicable, shares of our common stock for the
    period from April 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008
    and became convertible again beginning April 1, 2009
    through December 31, 2009. On December 29, 2008, a
    noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of
    $10.0 million. On February 4, 2009, the settlement
    date, we paid the noteholder the conversion value of the notes
    in cash, up to the principal amount of the notes. The excess of
    the conversion value over the principal amount, totaling
    $2.9 million, was paid in shares of common stock. This
    equity dilution upon conversion of the notes was offset by the
    reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge
    transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the
    notes. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the terms of the
    convertible senior notes.

Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to
    change, include expenditures related to:

•

potential strategic acquisitions and investments;

•

support of our commercialization efforts related to our current
    and future products, including expansion of our direct sales
    force and field support resources both in the United States and
    abroad;

•

the continued advancement of research and development efforts;

•

the acquisition of equipment and other fixed assets for use in
    our current and future manufacturing and research and
    development facilities;



•

improvements in our manufacturing capacity and
    efficiency; and

•

the expansion needs of our facilities, including costs of
    leasing additional facilities.

We expect that our product revenue and the resulting operating
    income, as well as the status of each of our new product
    development programs, will significantly impact our cash
    management decisions.

We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and
    income from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating
    needs in 2010, barring unforeseen circumstances. Operating needs
    include the planned costs to operate our business, including
    amounts required to fund working capital and capital
    expenditures. At the present time, we have no material
    commitments for capital expenditures. Our future capital
    requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend
    on many factors, including:

•

our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop
    our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;

•

scientific progress in our research and development programs and
    the magnitude of those programs;

•

competing technological and market developments; and

•

the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or
    acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement
    our product and service offerings.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We do not participate in any transactions that generate
    relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
    partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
    finance or special purpose entities, which would have been
    established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
    arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
    During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2010, we were not
    involved in any “off balance sheet arrangements”
    within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

Contractual
    Obligations

Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and
    liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude
    orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course
    of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. The
    following table represents our contractual obligations as of
    January 3, 2010, aggregated by type (amounts in thousands):

Debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible
    senior notes and interest payments totaling 0.625% per annum.
    Although these notes mature in 2014, we classify the notes as
    current liabilities because the conditions to convertibility
    were satisfied during the last three fiscal quarters of



2009 and may be satisfied during certain quarters in 2010. See
    Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes.

(3)

The $10.0 million included within contingent consideration
    is the amount owed to the former shareholders of Avantome, Inc.
    for the achievement of a certain date-specific milestones. The
    table excludes $20.0 million in additional contingent cash
    consideration we may be required to pay based on the achievement
    of certain additional milestones that do not have a fixed
    funding date and are subject to certain conditions that may or
    may not occur.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical
    experience, market and other conditions and various other
    assumptions it believes to be reasonable. Although these
    estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of
    current events and actions that may impact us in the future, the
    estimation process is by its nature uncertain given that
    estimates depend on events over which we may not have control.
    If market and other conditions change from those that we
    anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be
    materially affected. In addition, if our assumptions change, we
    may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective
    actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies and
    estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and
    require our most significant judgments. In addition, had we used
    estimates different from any of these, our consolidated
    financial statements could have been materially different from
    those presented. Members of our senior management have discussed
    the development and selection of our critical accounting
    policies and estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with
    the audit committee of our board of directors. Our accounting
    policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and
    services. Product revenue primarily consists of sales of arrays,
    reagents, flow cells and instrumentation. Service and other
    revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping
    and sequencing services, extended warranty sales and amounts
    earned under research agreements with government grants, which
    are recognized in the period during which the related costs are
    incurred. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of
    revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety
    of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and
    the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of
    the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves
    significant judgments and estimates and actual results may
    differ from our estimates.

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
    the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable
    and collectibility is reasonably assured. In instances where
    final acceptance of the product or system is required, revenue
    is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met. All
    revenue is recorded net of any discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured. Revenue for genotyping and sequencing
    services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the
    time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is delivered to
    the customer or agreed-to milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable,
    we ensure there are no refund rights. If payment terms are based
    on future performance, we defer revenue recognition until the
    price becomes fixed or determinable. We assess collectibility
    based on a number of factors, including past transaction history
    with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If
    we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably
    assured, revenue recognition is deferred until the time
    collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon
    receipt of payment.



Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. We also sell separately priced maintenance (extended
    warranty) contracts, which are generally for one year, starting
    upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for
    extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
    the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If we were to experience an increase in
    warranty claims or if costs of servicing its products under
    warranty were greater than its estimates, gross margins could be
    adversely affected.

We regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from
    multiple deliverables including any mix of products

and/or

services. These products

and/or

services are generally delivered within a short time frame,
    approximately three to six months, of the contract execution
    date. Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple
    deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting
    determined to exist in the contract. A delivered item is
    considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item
    has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. Items are
    considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold
    separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the
    item on a stand-alone basis.

For transactions entered into in 2009, consideration is
    allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables
    based on their relative selling price. The relative selling
    price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party
    evidence of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither
    VSOE nor third-party evidence exists, we use best estimate of
    the selling price for the deliverable. See

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information related to our
    change in authoritative accounting guidance for revenue
    recognition.

For transactions entered into prior to 2009, consideration was
    generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its
    relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement. The
    fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the
    product, if the item was regularly sold on a stand-alone basis.
    In those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for the undelivered items but not for the
    delivered items, the residual method was used to allocate the
    arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount
    of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items
    equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
    fair value of the undelivered items. When we were unable to
    establish stand-alone value for delivered items or when fair
    value of undelivered items had not been established, revenue was
    deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been
    performed, or until fair value could objectively be determined
    for any remaining undelivered elements.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, we must regularly
    sell the product

and/or

service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced
    within a relatively narrow range. VSOE of selling price is
    usually the midpoint of that range. If there is not a sufficient
    number of standalone sales and VSOE of selling price cannot be
    determined, then we consider whether third party evidence can be
    used to establish selling price. Due to the lack of similar
    products and services sold by other companies within the
    industry, we have rarely established selling price using
    third-party evidence. If neither VSOE nor third party evidence
    of selling price exists, we determine its best estimate of
    selling price using average selling prices over a rolling
    12 month period as well as market conditions. If the
    product or service has no history of sales, we rely upon prices
    set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts.

We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we
    determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer
    acceptance.

Investments

We determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based
    on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or
    most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use



of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three
    levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
    observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are
    observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices
    for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
    are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
    corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
    full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

In using this fair value hierarchy, management may be required
    to make assumptions of pricing by market participants and
    assumptions about risk, specifically when using unobservable
    inputs to determine fair value. These assumptions are judgmental
    in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
    losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make
    required payments. We evaluate the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. We
    regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time
    receivables are outstanding, review historical loss rates and
    assess current economic trends that may impact the level of
    credit losses in the future. Our allowance for doubtful accounts
    has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses.
    However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the
    financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that
    our reserves will continue to be adequate.

Inventory
    Valuation

We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess,
    obsolete or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net
    realizable value. We must make assumptions about future demand,
    market conditions and the release of new products that will
    supersede old ones. We regularly review inventory for excess and
    obsolete products and components, taking into account product
    life cycle and development plans, product expiration and quality
    issues, historical experience and our current inventory levels.
    If actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated,
    additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are subject to legal proceedings primarily related to
    intellectual property matters. We routinely assess the
    likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as
    well as ranges of probable losses, to the extent losses are
    reasonably estimable. If losses are probable and reasonably
    estimable, we will record a liability and an expense for the
    estimated loss. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is
    provided if the likelihood of occurrence is probable and the
    exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial
    statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of
    litigation matters, management considers many factors. These
    factors include, but are not limited to, past history,
    scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of
    each matter. We may change our estimates if our assessment of
    the various factors changes, which may result in the recording
    of an accrual or a change in a previously recorded accrual.
    Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating
    related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties
    that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates
    and accruals.

Business
    Combinations and Intangible Asset Valuation

Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the
    purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of
    purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. We
    engage third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining
    the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
    These



valuations require us to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

The Company’s intangible assets are comprised primarily of
    licensed technology from the Affymetrix settlement entered into
    on January 9, 2008 and acquired core technology and
    customer relationships from the Solexa acquisition. Management
    uses a discounted cash flow method to value our intangible
    assets. This method requires significant management judgment to
    forecast future operating results and establish residual growth
    rates and discount factors. The estimates we use to value and
    amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and
    estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on
    available historical information and industry estimates and
    averages. If the subsequent actual results and updated
    projections of the underlying business activity change compared
    with the assumptions and projections used to develop these
    values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we
    have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and
    these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization
    expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change,
    depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or
    slowed.

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets —
    Impairment Assessments

We estimate the fair value of intangible assets and other
    long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an
    event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying
    value of the asset may not be recovered through undiscounted
    future operating cash flows. We test for potential impairment of
    goodwill annually in our second fiscal quarter or whenever
    indicators of impairment arise.

In order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible
    assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful
    lives, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from
    those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted
    cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future
    cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period
    of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of
    achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.
    Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and
    timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving
    those cash flows. We had a total of $213.4 million in
    goodwill, $117.2 million in net property and equipment and
    $43.8 million in net intangible assets on our balance sheet
    at January 3, 2010.

In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we use a
    weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as
    the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded
    companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market
    approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of
    assumptions, including market factors specific to the business,
    the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be
    generated by the business over an extended period of time,
    long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return
    that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and
    the time value of money. Although the assumptions we use in our
    discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions
    we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts,
    significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and
    timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving
    those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make
    judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies
    engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors
    such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on
    investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market
    multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these
    companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own
    businesses.

Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining
    useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be
    affected by a variety of factors, including external factors
    such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such
    as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
    For example, if our future operating results do not meet current
    forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market
    capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a
    reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units,
    we may be required to record future impairment charges for
    purchased intangible assets and goodwill. Impairment charges
    could materially decrease our future net income and result in
    lower asset values on our balance sheet.



Convertible
    Senior Notes

During the first quarter of 2009, we adopted new authoritative
    guidance that significantly impacts the accounting for our
    convertible senior notes by requiring us to account separately
    for the liability and equity components of the notes. The
    liability component is measured so the effective interest
    expense associated with the notes reflects the issuer’s
    borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt
    instruments without the conversion feature. The difference
    between the cash proceeds associated with the notes and this
    estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and
    amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes.

Determining the fair value of the liability component requires
    the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. These estimates
    and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a
    significant impact on the determination of the liability
    component and, in effect, the associated interest expense.
    According to the guidance, the carrying amount of the liability
    component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar
    liability that does not have an associated equity component. If
    no similar liabilities exist, estimates of fair value are
    primarily determined using assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the liability component, including market
    interest rates, credit standing, yield curves and volatilities.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We are required to measure and recognize compensation expense
    for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and
    directors based on estimated fair value. We estimate the fair
    value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our
    employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes-Merton
    (BSM) option-pricing model. The fair value of our restricted
    stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on
    the date of grant.

The determination of fair value of stock-based awards using the
    BSM model requires the use of certain estimates and highly
    judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements
    of Operations. These include estimates of the expected
    volatility of our stock price, expected option life, expected
    dividends and the risk-free interest rate. We determine the
    volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical
    and implied volatility of our common stock. The historical
    volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is
    generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our
    stock options, adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations
    not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant factors.
    Implied volatility is calculated from the implied market
    volatility of exchange-traded call options on our common stock.
    The expected option life of an award is based on historical
    forfeiture experience, exercise activity and on the terms and
    conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. We
    determined expected dividend yield to be 0% given we have never
    declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we
    currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends. The
    risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury
    securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of
    the share-based awards. If any of the assumptions used in the
    BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense
    may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current
    period.

Income
    Taxes

Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect
    our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.
    Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of
    existing tax laws or regulations in the U.S. and the
    numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income
    tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes.
    Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and estimates of the
    company’s future taxable income could impact the deferred
    tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated
    financial statements and would require an adjustment to the
    provision for income taxes.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the
    likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A
    valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more
    likely than not the future realization of all or some of a
    deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating our
    ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction
    which they arise we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book
    income for the past three years, scheduled



reversals of deferred tax liabilities, our history of earnings
    and reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income
    over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and
    prudent tax planning strategies. Based on the available evidence
    as of January 3, 2010, we were not able to conclude it is
    more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax
    assets will be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation
    allowance of $2.8 million and $12.1 million against
    certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.

We recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial
    statements only if that position is more likely than not of
    being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on
    the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities regularly
    examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business
    and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company’s
    return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the
    uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments
    that are materially different from our current estimate of the
    tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and
    penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes
    in the period in which they are determined.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

Information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements is
    included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our investment portfolio. The fair market
    value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by
    fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating
    rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest
    rates. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate
    derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate
    changes. We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our
    invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk
    and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by investing in
    investment grade securities. We have historically maintained a
    relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio,
    and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move
    in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve
    would not materially affect the fair value of our interest
    sensitive financial instruments. For example, if a
    100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to
    occur in 2010, our interest income would change by approximately
    $6.9 million in relation to amounts we would expect to
    earn, based on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
    investments as of January 3, 2010.

Market
    Price Sensitive Instruments

In order to reduce potential equity dilution, in connection with
    the issuance (and potential conversion) of our convertible
    notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions,
    entitling us to purchase up to 18,322,320 shares of our
    common stock at a strike price of $21.83 per share, subject to
    adjustment. In addition, we sold to the hedge transaction
    counterparties warrants exercisable on a net-share basis, for up
    to 18,322,320 shares of our common stock at a strike price
    of $31.435 per share, subject to adjustment. The anti-dilutive
    effect of the note hedge transactions, if any, could be
    partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our
    common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the
    exercise dates of the warrants, which occur during 2014,
    assuming the warrants are exercised.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

Many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their
    business in currencies other than the entity’s
    U.S. dollar functional currency. These transactions give
    rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. The
    value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to
    changes in currency exchange rates from the time the
    transactions are originated until settlement in cash. Our
    foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the
    Euro, Yen, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and
    Singapore dollar. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses
    on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are
    included in the determination of net income (loss). We
    recognized a



net currency exchange gain on business transactions, net of
    hedging transactions, of $0.4 million and $1.9 million
    for the years ended January 3, 2010 and December 28,
    2008, respectively, which are included in other income
    (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.

During 2009, we began using forward exchange contracts to manage
    a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign
    subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. We
    only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign
    currency exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We
    primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign
    currency exposures, and they generally have terms of one month
    or less. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of
    financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate
    exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also
    included in the determination of net income (loss), as they have
    not been designated for hedge accounting. These contracts, which
    settle monthly, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these
    specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled, so
    that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses
    or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary
    assets and liabilities. At January 3, 2010, we had an
    immaterial amount of foreign currency forward contracts
    outstanding to hedge foreign currency risk.

Controls
    and Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) our transactions are properly authorized;
    (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
    improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly
    recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. We also maintain internal
    controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable
    laws and our established financial policies.

We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of our management, including our
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of
    the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
    Securities Exchange Act), as of January 3, 2010. Based upon
    that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that, as of January 3, 2010,
    our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
    that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in
    the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
    Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and
    (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
    functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure
    controls and procedures, our management recognized that any
    controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
    operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
    desired control objectives, and our management have concluded
    that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
    reasonable assurance level. Because of inherent limitations in
    all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
    absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
    company have been detected.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with
    the participation of our management, including our chief
    executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in
    our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
    during the fourth quarter of 2009 and that has materially
    affected, or is



reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting. The evaluation did not identify any
    such change.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting based on the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of January 3, 2010. The
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 3, 2010 has been audited by Ernst &
    Young LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as stated
    in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of January 3, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Illumina,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of January 3, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of
    January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended January 3, 2010 of Illumina, Inc. and our report
    dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
    thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Illumina, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Illumina, Inc. as of January 3, 2010 and December 28,
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended January 3, 2010. Our audits also
    included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Illumina, Inc., at January 3, 2010
    and December 28, 2008, and the consolidated results of its
    operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended January 3, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Staff Position No. APB

14-1,

Accounting For Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

(Codified in FASB ASC Topic 470,

Debt
    Conversions and Other Options)

effective as of
    December 29, 2008 and retroactively adjusted all periods
    presented in the consolidated financial statements for this
    change. Also described in Note 1 is the Company’s 2009
    change in its method of accounting for revenue recognition with
    the adoption of amendments to the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board Accounting Standards Codification resulting from
    Accounting Standards Update No.

2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

, and Accounting
    Standards Update

No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
    Elements

, both adopted effective December 29, 2008.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of January 3, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
    report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization
    and Business

Illumina, Inc. (the Company) is a leading developer,
    manufacturer and marketer of integrated systems for the analysis
    of genetic variation and biological function. Using the
    Company’s proprietary technologies, Illumina provides a
    comprehensive line of products and services that currently serve

    Company expects to enter the market for molecular diagnostics.
    The Company’s customers include leading genomic research
    centers, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions,
    clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies.

Acquisitions

On August 1, 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of
    Avantome, Inc., a development-stage company creating a low cost,
    long-read sequencing technology. At the time of the acquisition,
    the Company paid $25.8 million in cash, including
    transaction costs, and recorded a charge of $24.7 million
    for purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D).
    As part of the acquisition agreement, Illumina agreed to pay
    Avantome’s former shareholders up to an additional
    $35.0 million in contingent cash consideration based on the
    achievement of certain milestones. For the year ended
    January 3, 2010, the Company recorded IPR&D of
    $11.3 million and compensation expense of $3.7 million
    associated with these milestones. For the year ended
    December 28, 2008, compensation expense of
    $1.5 million was recorded associated with these milestones.
    Compensation expense associated with the Avantome acquisition is
    included in research and development in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

On January 26, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition
    of Solexa, Inc., in a

stock-for-stock

merger transaction. The Company issued 26.2 million shares
    of its common stock as consideration for this merger. Based on
    the estimated fair values at the acquisition date, the Company
    allocated $303.4 million to IPR&D, $62.2 million
    to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
    $24.4 million to intangible assets. The remaining excess of
    the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of
    $213.4 million was allocated to goodwill.

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
    prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of the
    Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the
    Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or
    14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31,
    June 30, and September 30. The year ended
    January 3, 2010 was 53 weeks; the years ended
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 were
    52 weeks.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    current year presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2009,
    the Company determined that pre-acquisition net operating loss
    carryforwards of Solexa that were included in goodwill could be
    utilized by the Company. Therefore, the Company has updated the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures to
    reclassify $15.3 million from goodwill to

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

long-term deferred tax assets to correctly reflect the tax
    effect of Solexa’s pre-acquisition net operating losses
    that can be utilized by the Company.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Segment
    Information

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company reorganized its
    operating structure into a newly created Life Sciences Business
    Unit, which includes all products and services that are
    primarily related to the research market, namely the sequencing,
    BeadArray, and VeraCode product lines. The Company also created
    a Diagnostics Business Unit to focus on the emerging opportunity
    in molecular diagnostics. For the year ended January 3,
    2010, the Company had limited activity related to the
    Diagnostics Business Unit and operating results were reported on
    an aggregate basis to the chief operating decision maker of the
    Company, the chief executive officer. Accordingly, the Company
    operated in one segment for the year ended January 3, 2010.
    The Company will begin reporting in two segments once revenues,
    operating profit or loss, or assets of the Diagnostics Business
    Unit exceed 10% of the consolidated amounts.

Cash
    Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly liquid
    investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the
    date of purchase.

Short-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury and
    U.S. government agency securities, municipal notes,
    corporate notes and bonds and commercial paper. Management
    classifies short-term investments as

available-for-sale

or trading at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
    classification as of each balance sheet date. All short-term
    investments are recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized
    gains and losses for

available-for-sale

and trading securities are included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity,
    and other income, net, respectively. The Company evaluates its
    investments to assess whether those with unrealized loss
    positions are other than temporarily impaired. Impairments are
    considered to be other than temporary if it is likely that the
    Company will have to sell the securities before the recovery of
    their cost basis and it is the Company’s intent to do so.
    Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
    other than temporary are determined based on the specific
    identification method and are reported in other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Included in short-term investments are the Company’s
    auction rate securities and a put option related to the
    Company’s settlement agreement with UBS that gives the
    Company the right to sell its auction rate securities to
    UBS AG (UBS) at par value during the period of
    June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012 (the Settlement).
    These securities had previously been classified as long-term
    investments; however, they were reclassified to short-term
    investments in fiscal 2009 as the Company intends to exercise
    its right to sell the securities back to UBS during the
    Settlement period. The auction rate securities are classified as
    trading securities and both the put option and the auction rate
    securities are recorded at estimated fair value, with unrealized
    gains and losses, if any, recognized in other income (expense),
    net on the consolidated statements of operations. See
    Note 3 for further detailed discussion.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash
    equivalents, foreign cash accounts, accounts receivable, prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued
    expenses and other current liabilities approximate the related
    fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
    instruments. The estimated fair value of the convertible senior
    notes is determined by using available market information as of
    the latest trading date prior to the Company’s fiscal
    year-end provided by a third party financial institution. The
    par value and fair value of the Company’s convertible notes
    was $390.0 million and $553.2 million, respectively,
    at January 3, 2010 and $400.0 million and
    $473.0 million, respectively, at December 28, 2008.

Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net invoice value
    and are not interest bearing. The Company considers receivables
    past due based on the contractual payment terms. The Company
    reviews its exposure to amounts receivable and reserves specific
    amounts if collectibility is no longer reasonably assured. The
    Company also reserves a percentage of its trade receivable
    balance based on collection history and current economic trends
    that might impact the level of future credit losses. The Company
    re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and adjusts its
    reserves as needed.

Concentrations
    of Risk

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and
    rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting
    customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or
    services with new capabilities and other factors could
    negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

The Company is also subject to risks related to its financial
    instruments including its cash and cash equivalents, investments
    and accounts receivable. Most of the Company’s cash and
    cash equivalents as of January 3, 2010 were deposited with
    financial institutions in the United States. The Company’s
    investment policy restricts the amount of credit exposure to any
    one issuer to 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase and to
    any one industry sector, as defined by Bloomberg
    classifications, to 25% of the portfolio at the time of
    purchase. There is no limit to the percentage of the portfolio
    that may be maintained in securities issued by the U.S
    government and money market funds. The Company has historically
    not experienced significant credit losses from investments and
    accounts receivable. The Company performs a regular review of
    customer activity and associated credit risks.

The Company’s products require customized components that
    currently are available from a limited number of sources. The
    Company obtains certain key components included in its products
    from single vendors.

Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised 48%,
    51% and 43% of the Company’s revenue for the years ended
    January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, respectively. Customers outside the
    United States represented 46% and 61% of the Company’s net
    accounts receivable balance as of January 3, 2010 and
    December 28, 2008, respectively. Sales to territories
    outside of the United States are generally denominated in
    U.S. dollars. International sales entail a variety of
    risks, including currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment
    cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection.
    The Company is also subject to general geopolitical risks, such
    as political, social and economic instability and changes in
    diplomatic and trade relations. The risks of international sales
    are mitigated in part by the extent to which sales are
    geographically distributed.

Aggregated accounts receivable from one customer comprised more
    than 10% of gross customer receivable at January 3, 2010.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first in,
    first out basis) or market. Inventory includes raw materials and
    finished goods that may be used in the research and development
    process and such items are expensed as consumed or expired.
    Provisions for slow moving, excess and obsolete inventories are
    provided based on product life cycle and development plans,
    product expiration and quality issues, historical experience and
    inventory levels.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review of
    impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of
    the assets (generally three to seven years) using the
    straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
    computed over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
    useful life of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are
    charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold, or
    otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
    depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
    is included in operating expense.

Goodwill,
    Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net
    assets acquired. Intangible assets include acquired technology,
    customer relationships, other license agreements and licensed
    technology (capitalized as part of the Affymetrix litigation).
    The cost of identified intangible assets is amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to ten years
    unless the expected benefit pattern is declining, in which case
    an accelerated method is used.

The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if the
    carrying values of the long-lived assets are impaired. Goodwill
    and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives
    are reviewed for impairment at least annually during the second
    fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating
    the potential for impairment. The Company performed its annual
    impairment test of goodwill in May of 2009, utilizing a test
    that begins with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting
    unit or intangible asset, noting no impairment and has
    determined there have been no impairment indicators for goodwill
    through January 3, 2010. A review of intangible assets that
    have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets is
    performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for
    impairment. If indicators of impairment exist, the Company
    assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by
    determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds
    its estimated fair value. If impairment is indicated, the
    Company compares the carrying amount to the estimated fair value
    of the asset and adjusts the value of the asset accordingly.
    Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include
    a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and
    market capitalization compared to its net book value,
    significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to
    generate positive cash flows and significant changes in the
    Company’s strategic business objectives and utilization of
    the asset.

Reserve
    for Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    genotyping, gene expression and sequencing systems.
    Additionally, the Company provides a warranty on its consumable
    sales through the expiry date, which generally ranges from six
    to twelve months after the manufacture date. At the time revenue
    is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for estimated
    warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as
    anticipated product performance. This expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of product revenue. Estimated warranty
    expenses associated with extended maintenance contracts for
    systems are recorded as a cost of service and other revenue
    ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. See
    Note 6 for further detailed discussion.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale
    of products and services. Product revenue primarily consists of
    sales of arrays, reagents, flow cells and instrumentation.
    Service and other revenue consists of revenue received for
    performing genotyping and sequencing services, extended warranty
    sales and amounts earned under research agreements with
    government grants, which are recognized in the period during
    which the related costs are incurred.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or
    determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In
    instances where final acceptance of the product or system is
    required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria
    have been met. All revenue is recorded net of any discounts.

Revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment
    and transfer of title to the customer, provided no significant
    obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured. Revenue for genotyping and sequencing
    services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the
    time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made
    available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable,
    the Company ensures there are no refund rights. If payment terms
    are based on future performance, the Company defers revenue
    recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable. The
    Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors,
    including past transaction history with the customer and the
    creditworthiness of the customer. If the Company determines that
    collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue
    recognition is deferred until the time collection becomes
    reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.

Sales of instrumentation generally include a standard one-year
    warranty. The Company also sells separately priced maintenance
    (extended warranty) contracts, which are generally for one year,
    upon the expiration of the initial warranty. Revenue for
    extended warranty sales is recognized ratably over the term of
    the extended warranty period. Reserves are provided for
    estimated product warranty expenses at the time the associated
    revenue is recognized. If the Company were to experience an
    increase in warranty claims or if costs of servicing its
    products under warranty were greater than its estimates, gross
    margins could be adversely affected.

The Company regularly enters into contracts where revenue is
    derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products

and/or

services. These products

and/or

services are generally delivered within a short time frame,
    approximately three to six months, of the contract execution
    date. Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple
    deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting
    determined to exist in the contract. A delivered item is
    considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item
    has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. Items are
    considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold
    separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the
    item on a stand-alone basis.

For transactions entered into during 2009, consideration is
    allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables
    based on their relative selling price. The relative selling
    price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific
    objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party
    evidence of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither
    VSOE nor third-party evidence exists, the Company uses its best
    estimate of the selling price for the deliverable. See

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

in Note 1 for further
    information related to the Company’s change in
    authoritative accounting guidance for revenue recognition.

For transactions entered into prior to 2009, consideration was
    generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its
    relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair
    value existed for all units of accounting in an arrangement. The
    fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the
    product, if the item was regularly sold on a stand-alone basis.
    In those instances when objective and reliable

F-11


ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not
    for the delivered items, the residual method was used to
    allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual
    method, the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the
    delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less
    the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items. When the
    Company was unable to establish stand-alone value for delivered
    items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been
    established, revenue was deferred until all elements were
    delivered and services had been performed, or until fair value
    could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered
    elements.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, the Company must
    regularly sell the product

and/or

service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced
    within a relatively narrow range. VSOE of selling price is
    usually the midpoint of that range. If there is not a sufficient
    number of standalone sales and VSOE of selling price cannot be
    determined, then the Company considers whether third party
    evidence can be used to establish selling price. Due to the lack
    of similar products and services sold by other companies within
    the industry, the Company has rarely established selling price
    using third-party evidence. If neither VSOE nor third party
    evidence of selling price exists, the Company determines its
    best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over
    a rolling 12 month period as well as market conditions. If
    the product or service has no history of sales, the Company
    relies upon prices set by the Company’s pricing committee
    adjusted for applicable discounts.

The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when
    it determines there are no uncertainties regarding customer
    acceptance. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between
    delivered and undelivered elements can impact the timing of
    revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue
    recognized on any arrangement.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair value of its assets and
    liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received
    for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in
    the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
    the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses a fair value
    hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two
    are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure
    fair value:

•

Level 1 —

Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 —

Inputs, other than Level 1,
    that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
    in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 —

Unobservable inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The following table presents the Company’s fair value
    hierarchy for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis
    as of January 3, 2010 (in thousands):

Shipping
    and Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product
    revenue and totaled $4.8 million, $3.7 million and
    $2.2 million for the years ended January 3, 2010,
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
    internal and grant-sponsored research and development. Research
    and development expenses include salaries, contractor fees,
    facilities costs, utilities and allocations of benefits.
    Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed
    in the period incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as
    incurred.

Advertising costs were
    $4.2 million, $3.4 million and $2.8 million for
    the years ended January 3, 2010, December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, respectively.

Leases

Leases are reviewed and classified as capital or operating at
    their inception. For leases that contain rent escalations, the
    Company records the total rent payable on a straight-line basis
    over the term of the lease, which includes the construction
    build-out period but excludes lease extension periods. The
    difference between rent payments and straight-line rent expense
    is recorded in other long-term liabilities. Landlord allowances
    are also recorded in other long-term liabilities, which are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a
    reduction to rent expense.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the
    expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years
    in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. The
    effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in
    the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the
    likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A
    valuation allowance is established when the Company believes it
    is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of
    a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating the
    ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction
    which they arise the Company considers all available positive
    and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative
    pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled
    reversals of deferred tax liabilities, history of earnings and
    reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over
    the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and
    prudent tax planning strategies.

The Company recognizes excess tax benefits associated with
    share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when
    realized. When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company.

F-13


ILLUMINA,

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the
    financial statements only if that position is more likely than
    not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities,
    based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and
    penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected
    in income tax expense.

Functional
    Currency

Prior to the third quarter of 2008, the Company identified the
    local currency as the functional currency in each of its foreign
    subsidiaries, with all translation adjustments recorded as part
    of other comprehensive income. Beginning in the third quarter of
    2008, the Company reorganized its international structure to
    execute a more efficient relationship between product
    development, product manufacturing and sales. This
    reorganization increased the foreign subsidiaries’
    dependence on the U.S. entity for management decisions,
    financial support, production assets and inventory, thereby
    making the foreign subsidiaries a direct and integral component
    of the U.S. entity’s operations. As a result, the
    Company reassessed the primary economic environment of its
    foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a U.S. dollar functional
    currency determination. Beginning in the third quarter of 2008,
    the Company remeasures its foreign subsidiaries’ assets and
    liabilities and revenue and expense accounts related to monetary
    assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the
    net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
    Gains resulting from remeasurement were $0.4 million and
    $1.9 million for the years ended January 3, 2010 and
    December 28, 2008, respectively. There were no gains or
    losses resulting from remeasurement in the year ended
    December 30, 2007.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risks in the
    normal course of business. To manage a portion of the accounting
    exposure resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to
    hedge monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
    currencies other than the functional currency of its
    subsidiaries. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at
    fair value and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and
    are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the value
    of the derivative are recognized in other income (expense), net,
    in the consolidated statements of operations for the current
    period, along with an offsetting gain or loss on the underlying
    assets or liabilities.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock
    purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). This
    model incorporates various assumptions including expected
    volatility, expected option life, expected dividends, and the
    risk-free interest rates. The Company determines volatility by
    equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of the
    Company’s common stock. The historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock over the most recent period is
    generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
    Company’s stock options, adjusted for the impact of unusual
    fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur and other relevant
    factors. The implied volatility is calculated from the implied
    market volatility of exchange-traded call options on the
    Company’s common stock. The expected life of an award is
    based on historical forfeiture experience, exercise activity,
    and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to
    employees.

NOTES TO

Basic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing net
    income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per
    share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period
    increased to include dilutive potential common shares using the
    treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares consist
    of stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized
    compensation expense that are less than the average market price
    of the Company’s common stock, restricted stock units with
    unrecognized compensation expense, convertible debt when the
    average market price of the Company’s common stock is above
    the conversion price of $21.83 and warrants with exercise prices
    that are less than the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock. Under the treasury stock method,
    the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and
    warrants, the amount of compensation expense for future services
    that the Company has not yet recognized for stock options and
    restricted stock units and the amount of tax benefits that will
    be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards become
    deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. In loss
    periods, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share
    are identical since the effect of dilutive potential common
    shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

Adopted
    Accounting Pronouncements

Convertible
    Debt Instruments

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments
    that may be settled in cash upon conversion. The Company adopted
    the guidance effective December 29, 2008, impacting the
    accounting for the Company’s convertible senior notes by
    requiring the Company to account separately for the liability
    and equity components of the convertible debt. The liability
    component is measured at its estimated fair value such that the
    effective interest expense associated with the convertible debt
    reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate at the date of
    issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion
    feature. The difference between the cash proceeds associated
    with the convertible debt and this estimated fair value is
    recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense
    over the life of the convertible debt using the effective
    interest rate method. Upon application of this guidance, the
    only change to diluted earnings per share resulted from the
    effects of increased interest expense and the associated tax
    effects. The guidance requires retrospective application to the
    terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented.
    See Note 7 for information on the impact of our adoption of
    the guidance and the assumptions we used to estimate the fair
    value of the liability component.

Derivatives

In June 2008, the FASB ratified authoritative guidance
    addressing the accounting for certain instruments (or embedded
    features) determined to be indexed to an entity’s own
    stock. This guidance provides that an entity should use a
    two-step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial
    instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock,
    including evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise
    and settlement provisions. The Company adopted this guidance
    effective December 29, 2008, requiring the Company to
    perform additional analyses on both its freestanding equity
    derivatives and embedded equity derivative features. However,
    the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

In April 2009, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance
    on the fair value of financial instruments, which provides:

•

further provisions on estimating fair value when the markets
    become inactive and quoted prices reflect distressed
    transactions;

•

extended disclosure requirements for interim financial
    statements regarding the fair value of financial
    instruments; and

•

new criteria for recording impairment charges on investments in
    debt instruments.

F-17


ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis in the
    interim period ended June 28, 2009 without material impact
    on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Refer
    to Note 3 for further detailed discussion on the fair value
    of financial instruments.

Accounting
    for Subsequent Events

In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to
    general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events
    that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
    statements are issued or are available to be issued. The Company
    adopted this guidance in the interim period ended June 28,
    2009 without material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

FASB
    Codification

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the
    FASB Codification to become the source of authoritative,
    nongovernmental GAAP. The Codification did not change GAAP but
    reorganizes the literature. The Company adopted this guidance in
    the interim period ended September 27, 2009 without
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

In September 2009, the FASB ratified authoritative accounting
    guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with
    multiple deliverables. The guidance affects the determination of
    separate units of accounting in arrangements with multiple
    deliverables and the allocation of transaction consideration to
    each of the identified units of accounting. Previously, a
    delivered item was considered a separate unit of accounting when
    it had value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and there
    was objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
    undelivered items. The new guidance eliminates the requirement
    for objective and reliable evidence of fair value to exist for
    the undelivered items in order for a delivered item to be
    treated as a separate unit of accounting. The guidance also
    requires arrangement consideration to be allocated at the
    inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the
    relative-selling-price method and eliminates the use of the
    residual method of allocation. Under the relative-selling-price
    method, the selling price for each deliverable is determined
    using VSOE of selling price or third-party evidence of selling
    price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor third-party
    evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable, the guidance
    requires an entity to determine the best estimate of the selling
    price.

The Company adopted the guidance on a prospective basis in the
    interim period ended September 27, 2009. Prospective
    application required the Company to apply the guidance to all
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since
    the beginning of fiscal 2009. This prospective application had
    no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements for the interim periods ended March 29, 2009 and
    June 28, 2009. During the third and fourth quarter of 2009,
    the Company recorded additional revenue of $2.3 million and
    $5.7 million respectively, which would have been deferred
    under previous accounting guidance. In future interim and fiscal
    year periods, the adoption of this guidance may have a material
    impact on the Company’s financial results to the extent the
    Company enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables and
    does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price for
    material undelivered elements. Refer to the

Summary of
    Significant Accounting Principles

in Note 1 for further
    information on the Company’s revenue recognition policies.

In September 2009, the FASB also ratified authoritative
    accounting guidance requiring the sales of all tangible products
    containing both software and non-software components that
    function together to deliver the product’s essential
    functionality to be excluded from the scope of the software
    revenue guidance. The Company adopted the guidance on a
    prospective basis during the three months ended
    September 27, 2009 effective for all periods in 2009. Prior
    to the adoption of this guidance, the Company assessed all
    software items included in the Company’s product offerings
    to be incidental to the product itself and, therefore,

F-18


ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

excluded all sales from the scope of the related software
    revenue guidance. As a result, the adoption of this guidance had
    no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Definition
    of a Business

During 2009, the FASB revised guidance related to business
    combinations, which changed the definition of a business.
    Previously, a business was defined as having three elements:
    (i) inputs, (ii) processes applied to those inputs,
    and (iii) outputs. The new guidance broadens the definition
    and no longer requires the third element to be present for a set
    of activities and assets to be considered a business. The
    Company has adopted this guidance for the interim period ending
    January 3, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have
    a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value of Liabilities

In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related
    to measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an
    active market is not available. This guidance is effective for
    reporting periods beginning after August 28, 2009. The
    Company has adopted this guidance in the interim period ending
    January 3, 2010. The adoption of this guidance did not have
    a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Variable
    Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that amends
    the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity and requires a quarterly reassessment
    of the treatment of such entities. The guidance also requires
    additional disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement in
    a variable interest entity. The Company will adopt this guidance
    in the first interim period of fiscal 2010 and is currently
    evaluating the impact of the pending adoption on the
    consolidated financial statements.

Trading
    Securities

At January 3, 2010, the Company’s trading securities
    consisted of $54.9 million (at cost) in auction rate
    securities issued primarily by municipalities and universities.
    The auction rate securities are held in a brokerage account with
    UBS Financial Services, Inc., a subsidiary of UBS. These
    securities are debt instruments with a long-term maturity and
    with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through
    auctions.

The markets for auction rate securities effectively ceased when
    the vast majority of auctions failed in February 2008,
    preventing investors from selling these securities. As of
    January 3, 2010, the securities continued to fail auction
    and remained illiquid. Changes in the fair value of the
    Company’s auction rate securities from December 28,
    2008 through January 3, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):

Unrealized gains and losses associated with the Company’s
    auction rate securities are classified as other income
    (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations for
    the year ended January 3, 2010.

In determining the fair value of the Company’s auction rate
    securities, the Company considered trades in the secondary
    market. However, due to the auction failures of the auction rate
    securities in the marketplace and the lack of trading in the
    secondary market of these instruments, there was insufficient
    observable auction rate security market information available to
    directly determine the fair value of the Company’s
    investments. As a result, the value of these securities and
    resulting unrealized gain was determined using Level 3
    hierarchical inputs. These inputs include management’s
    assumptions of pricing by market participants, including
    assumptions about risk. The Company used the concepts of fair
    value based on estimated discounted future cash flows of
    interest income over a projected 17 year period, which is
    reflective of the weighted average life of the student loans in
    the underlying trust. In preparing this model, the Company used
    historical data of the rates upon which a majority of the
    auction rate securities’ contractual rates were based, such
    as the LIBOR and average trailing twelve-month

90-day

treasury interest rate spreads, to estimate future interest
    rates. The Company also considered the discount factors, taking
    into account the credit ratings of the auction rate securities,
    using a range of discount rates from 5.9% to 7.2%. The Company
    obtained information from multiple sources, including UBS, to
    determine a reasonable range of assumptions to use in valuing
    the auction rate securities. The Company’s model was
    corroborated by a separate comparable cash flow analysis
    prepared by UBS. To understand the sensitivity of the
    Company’s valuation, the liquidity factor and estimated

F-22


ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

remaining life was varied. Variations in those results were
    evaluated and it was determined the factors and valuation method
    chosen were reasonable and representative of the Company’s
    auction rate security portfolio.

As a result of the auction rate failures, various regulatory
    agencies initiated investigations into the sales and marketing
    practices of several banks and broker-dealers, including UBS,
    which sold auction rate securities, alleging violations of
    federal and state laws. Along with several other broker-dealers,
    UBS subsequently reached a settlement with the federal and state
    regulators that required them to repurchase auction rate
    securities from certain investors at par at some future date. In
    November 2008, the Company signed a settlement agreement
    granting the Company an option to sell its auction rate
    securities at par value to UBS during the period of
    June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012 (the Settlement).
    In accepting the Settlement, the Company released UBS from any
    claims relating to the marketing and sale of auction rate
    securities. Although the Company expects to sell its auction
    rate securities under the Settlement, if the Settlement is not
    exercised before July 2, 2012, it will expire and UBS will
    have no further rights or obligation to buy the Company’s
    auction rate securities. In lieu of the acceptance of the
    Settlement, the auction rate securities will continue to accrue
    interest as determined by the auction process or the terms
    outlined in the prospectus of the auction rate securities if the
    auction process fails. In addition to offering to repurchase the
    Company’s auction rate securities, as part of the
    Settlement, UBS has agreed to provide the Company with a
    “no net cost” loan up to 75% of the par value of the
    auction rate securities until June 30, 2010. According to
    the terms of the Settlement, the interest rate on the loan will
    approximate the weighted average interest or dividend rate
    payable to the Company by the issuer of any auction rate
    securities pledged as collateral.

UBS’s obligations under the Settlement are not secured by
    its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to
    support its performance obligations under the Settlement. UBS
    has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient
    financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the
    Settlement.

To account for the Settlement, the Company recorded a separate
    freestanding asset (put option) of $8.7 million and
    recognized a corresponding gain in earnings during the fourth
    quarter of 2008. Changes in the fair value of the Company’s
    put option from December 28, 2008 through January 3,
    2010 are as follows (in thousands):

(1)

Unrealized gains and losses associated with the Company’s
    put option are classified as other income (expense), net in the
    consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    January 3, 2010.

Since the put option does not meet the definition of a
    derivative instrument, the Company elected to measure it at fair
    value in accordance with authoritative guidance related to the
    fair value option for financial assets and financial
    liabilities. The Company valued the put option using a
    discounted cash flow approach including estimates of interest
    rates, timing and amount of cash flow, with consideration given
    to UBS’s financial ability to repurchase the auction rate
    securities beginning June 30, 2010. These assumptions are
    volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of
    these assumptions and market conditions change.

The Company will continue to recognize gains and losses in
    earnings approximating the changes in the fair value of the
    auction rate securities at each balance sheet date. These gains
    and losses are expected to be approximately offset by changes in
    the fair value of the put option.

The fair value of the auction rate securities and the put option
    total $54.9 million and $55.9 million at
    January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively.
    At January 3, 2010, the auction rate securities were
    classified as short-term investments as the Company intends to
    exercise the right to sell the securities back to UBS within the
    next year. At December 28, 2008, the Company classified
    these securities as long-term assets

Intangible
    Assets

The Company’s intangible assets are comprised primarily of
    licensed technology from the Affymetrix settlement entered into
    on January 9, 2008 and acquired core technology and
    customer relationships from the acquisition of Solexa. As a
    result of the Affymetrix settlement, the Company agreed, without
    admitting liability, to make a one-time payment to Affymetrix of
    $90.0 million. In return, Affymetrix agreed to dismiss with
    prejudice all lawsuits it had brought against the Company, and
    the Company agreed to dismiss with prejudice its counterclaims
    in the relevant lawsuits. Affymetrix also agreed not to sue the
    Company or its affiliates or customers for making, using or
    selling any of the Company’s current products, evolutions
    of those products or services related to those products. In
    addition, Affymetrix agreed that, for four years, it will not
    sue the Company for making, using or selling the Company’s
    products or services that are based on future technology
    developments. The covenant not to sue covers all fields other
    than photolithography, the process by which Affymetrix
    manufactures its arrays and a field in which the Company does
    not operate.

Of the total $90.0 million payment made on January 25,
    2008, $36.0 million was recorded as licensed technology and
    classified as an intangible asset. The remaining
    $54.0 million was charged to expense during the fourth
    quarter of 2007. This allocation was determined based on the
    fair value of past and estimated future revenue streams related
    to the products covered by the patents previously under dispute.
    The value of the licensed technology is the benefit derived,
    calculated using estimated discounted cash flows and future
    revenue projections, from the perpetual covenant not to sue for
    damages related to the sale of the Company’s current
    products. The effective life of the licensed technology extends
    through 2015, the final expiry date of all patents considered in
    valuing the intangible asset. The related amortization is based
    on the higher of the percentage of usage or the straight-line
    method. The percentage of usage was determined using actual and
    projected revenues generated from products covered by the
    patents previously under dispute.

Acquired core technology and customer relationships are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their effective useful
    lives of ten and three years, respectively. The amortization of
    the Company’s intangible assets is excluded from cost of
    product revenue and is separately classified as amortization of
    intangible assets on the Company’s consolidated statements
    of operations.

Impairment
    of Manufacturing Equipment

During fiscal 2008, the Company implemented next-generation
    imaging and decoding systems to be used in manufacturing. These
    systems were developed to increase existing capacity and allow
    the Company to transition to the Infinium High-Density (HD)
    product line. As a result of this transition, the demand for
    products manufactured on the previous infrastructure was reduced
    and certain systems were no longer being utilized. A non-cash
    impairment charge of $4.1 million was recorded in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2008 for the excess machinery. This
    charge is included as a separate line item in the Company’s
    consolidated statement of operations. There was no change to
    useful lives and related depreciation expense of the remaining
    assets as the Company believes these estimates are currently
    reflective of the period the assets will be used in operations.

Warranties

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty on
    genotyping, gene expression and sequencing systems.
    Additionally, the Company provides a warranty on its consumable
    sales through the expiry date, which generally ranges from six
    to twelve months after the manufacture date. At the time revenue
    is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for estimated
    warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as
    anticipated product performance. This expense is recorded as a
    component of cost of product revenue. Estimated warranty
    expenses associated with extended maintenance contracts for
    systems are recorded as a cost of service and other revenue
    ratably over the term of the maintenance contract.

Convertible
    Senior Notes

On February 16, 2007, the Company issued
    $400.0 million principal amount of 0.625% convertible
    senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds from the offering, after
    deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering
    expenses, were approximately $390.3 million. The Company
    will pay 0.625% interest per annum on the principal amount of
    the notes, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February
    15 and August 15 of each year. The Company made interest
    payments of $1.2 million on February 15, 2009 and
    August 15, 2009. The notes mature on February 15, 2014.

The notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable,
    shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.01 par value
    per share, based on a conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of
    45.8058 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which
    represents a conversion price of approximately $21.83 per
    share), only in the following circumstances and to the following
    extent: (1) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per
    note for each day of such measurement period was less than 97%
    of the product of the last reported sale price of the
    Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such
    day; (2) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported
    sale price of the Company’s common stock for 20 or more
    trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending
    on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar
    quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in
    effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding
    calendar quarter; (3) upon the occurrence of specified
    events; and (4) at any time on or after November 15,
    2013 through the third scheduled trading day immediately
    preceding the maturity date. The requirements of the second
    condition above were satisfied during the first, second and
    third quarters of 2009. Accordingly, the notes were convertible
    during the period from, and including, April 1, 2009
    through, and including, December 31, 2009. Additionally,
    these same requirements were satisfied during the third quarter
    of 2008, and, as a result, the notes were convertible during the
    period from, and including, October 1, 2008 through, and
    including, December 31, 2008. On December 29, 2008, a
    noteholder converted notes in an aggregate principal amount of
    $10.0 million. On February 4, 2009, the settlement
    date, we paid the noteholder the conversion value of the notes
    in cash, up to the principal amount of the notes. The excess of
    the conversion value over the principal amount, totaling
    $2.9 million, was paid in shares of common stock. This
    equity dilution upon conversion of the notes was offset by the
    reacquisition of the shares under the convertible note hedge
    transactions entered into in connection with the offering of the
    notes.

The hedge transaction entered with the initial purchasers

and/or

their
    affiliates (the hedge counterparties) entitles the Company to
    purchase up to 18,322,320 shares of the Company’s
    common stock at a strike price of approximately $21.83 per
    share, subject to adjustment. In addition, the Company sold to
    these hedge counterparties warrants exercisable, on a cashless
    basis, for up to 18,322,320 shares of the Company’s
    common stock at a strike price of $31.435 per share, subject to
    adjustment. The cost of the hedge transaction that was not
    covered by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants was
    approximately $46.6 million and was reflected as a
    reduction of additional paid-in capital. The hedge transaction
    is expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon
    conversion of the notes to the extent the Company exercises the
    hedge to purchase shares from the hedge counterparties to
    deliver to converting noteholders. However, the warrants could
    have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share
    to the extent that the price of the Company’s common stock
    exceeds the strike price of the warrants.

These adjustments include only non-cash interest expense. Cash
    interest expense for the year ended December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007 totaled $2.6 million and
    $1.4 million, respectively.

The new guidance requires the carrying amount of the liability
    component to be estimated by measuring the fair value of a
    similar liability that does not have an associated conversion
    feature. As the Company was unable to find any other comparable
    companies in industry and size with outstanding non-convertible
    public debt, the Company determined that senior, unsecured
    corporate bonds represent a similar liability to the convertible
    senior notes without the conversion option. To measure the fair
    value of the similar liability at February 16, 2007, the
    Company estimated an interest rate using assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the liability component,
    including market interest rates, credit standing, yield curves
    and volatilities, all of which are defined as Level 2
    Observable Inputs. The estimated interest rate of 8.27% was
    applied to the convertible senior notes and coupon interest
    using a present value technique to arrive at the fair value of
    the liability component. The difference between the cash
    proceeds associated with the convertible debt and this estimated
    fair value of the liability component is recorded as an equity
    component. We classified a portion of the equity component as
    temporary equity measured as the excess of a) the amount of
    cash that would be required to be paid upon conversion over
    b) the current carrying amount of the liability-classified
    component. This amount is reflected within conversion option
    subject to cash settlement in the consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 28, 2008, the principal amount of the
    convertible senior notes was $400.0 million and the
    unamortized discount was $123.1 million resulting in a net
    carrying amount of the liability component of
    $276.9 million. As of January 3, 2010, the principal
    amount of the liability component was $390.0 million due to
    the conversion of $10.0 million of the notes during the
    first quarter of 2009. Upon conversion, the Company recorded a
    gain of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2009,
    calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the
    converted notes and their estimated fair value as of the
    settlement date. To measure the fair value of the converted
    notes as of the settlement date, the Company calculated an
    interest rate of 11.3% using Level 2 Observable Inputs.
    This rate was applied to the converted notes and coupon interest
    rate using the same present value technique used in the issuance
    date valuation. The unamortized discount on the remaining
    convertible senior notes as of January 3, 2010 was
    $99.8 million, resulting in a net carrying amount of
    $290.2 million. The remaining period over which the
    discount on the liability component will be amortized is
    4.12 years.

On July 22, 2008, the Company announced a

two-for-one

stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend with a record
    date of September 10, 2008 and a distribution date of
    September 22, 2008. Share and per share amounts have been
    restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented.

On August 12, 2008, a total of 8,050,000 shares were
    sold to the public at a public offering price of $43.75 per
    share, raising net proceeds to the Company of

    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2000, the board of directors and stockholders
    adopted the 2000 ESPP. A total of 15,467,426 shares of the
    Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance
    under the ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase
    common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions,
    during defined offering periods.

The price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to
    85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or
    last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The initial
    offering period commenced in July 2000. In addition, beginning
    with fiscal 2001, the ESPP provides for annual increases of
    shares available for issuance by the lesser of 3% of the number
    of outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the
    last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year,
    3,000,000 shares or such lesser amount as determined by the
    Company’s board of directors. Shares totaling 359,713,
    276,198 and 266,962 were issued under the ESPP during fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 3, 2010,
    there were 13,434,449 shares available for issuance under
    the ESPP.

Restricted
    Stock Units

In 2007 the Company began granting restricted stock units
    pursuant to its 2005 Stock and Incentive Plan as part of its
    periodic employee equity compensation review program. Restricted
    stock units are share awards that, upon vesting, will deliver to
    the holder shares of the Company’s common stock. Restricted
    stock units granted during 2007 vest over four years as follows:
    15% vest on the first and second anniversaries of the grant
    date, 30% vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and
    40% vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Effective
    January 2008, the Company changed the vesting schedule for
    grants of new restricted stock units. Currently, restricted
    stock units vest 15% on the first anniversary of the grant date,
    20% on the second anniversary of the grant date, 30% on the
    third anniversary of the grant date and 35% on the fourth
    anniversary of the grant date. The Company satisfies restricted
    stock units vesting through the issuance of new shares.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity
    and related information from January 1, 2007 through
    January 3, 2010 is as follows:

    January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008, respectively.
    No restricted stock units were outstanding as of

    on that date was $81.1 million.

Warrants

In conjunction with its acquisition of Solexa, Inc. on
    January 26, 2007, the Company assumed 4,489,686 warrants
    issued by Solexa prior to the acquisition. During the year ended
    January 3, 2010, there were 954,376 warrants exercised,
    resulting in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately
    $7.6 million. As of January 3, 2010, 252,164 of the

Treasury
    Stock

In October 2008, the board of directors authorized a
    $120.0 million stock repurchase program. In fiscal 2008,
    the Company repurchased 3.1 million shares for
    $70.8 million under the program.

In July 2009, the board of directors authorized a
    $75.0 million stock repurchase program and concurrently
    terminated the $120.0 million stock repurchase program
    authorized in October 2008. In November 2009, upon the
    completion of the repurchase program authorized in
    July 2009, our board of directors authorized an additional
    $100.0 million stock repurchase program. In fiscal 2009,
    the Company repurchased a total of 6.1 million shares for
    $175.1 million under both programs in open-market
    transactions or through privately negotiated transactions in
    compliance with

Rule 10b-18

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Stockholder
    Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, the board of directors of the Company
    declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the
    Company. The dividend was payable on May 14, 2001 (the
    Record Date) to the stockholders of record on that date. Each
    Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
    Company one unit consisting of one-thousandth of a share of its
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a price of
    $100 per unit. The Rights will be exercisable if a person or
    group hereafter acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
    the outstanding common stock of the Company or announces an
    offer for 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. If a
    person or group acquires 15% or more of the outstanding common
    stock of the Company, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase, at the exercise price of the Right, a number of shares
    of common stock having a market value of

F-32


ILLUMINA,

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

two times the exercise price of the Right. If the Company is
    acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction
    after a person acquires 15% or more of the Company’s common
    stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
    Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of common
    shares of the acquiring company which at the time of such
    transaction have a market value of two times the exercise price
    of the Right. The board of directors will be entitled to redeem
    the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right at any time before any
    such person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
    outstanding common stock. The Rights expire on May 14, 2011
    unless such date is extended or the Rights are earlier redeemed
    or exchanged by the Company.

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than
    not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax
    assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a
    valuation allowance is performed on a

jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction

basis, and includes a review of all available positive and
    negative evidence. Based on the available evidence as of
    January 3, 2010, the Company was not able to conclude it is
    more likely than not certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax
    assets will be realized. Therefore, the Company

F-34


ILLUMINA,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded a valuation allowance of $2.8 million and
    $12.1 million against certain U.S. and foreign net
    deferred tax assets, respectively.

As of January 3, 2010, the Company had net operating loss
    carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of
    $25.4 million and $132.1 million, respectively, which
    begin to expire in 2012 and 2013, respectively, unless
    previously utilized. In addition, the Company also had
    U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit
    carryforwards of $16.0 million and $16.2 million,
    respectively, which begin to expire in 2018 and 2019,
    respectively, unless previously utilized.

As of January 3, 2010, the valuation allowance includes
    $12.3 million of pre-acquisition foreign deferred tax
    assets of Solexa. In accordance with the adoption of Topic 805
    to the extent any of these assets are recognized in the future
    the adjustment will be recorded as a reduction to the provision
    for income taxes.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and
    credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any
    significant future changes in its ownership structure. These
    annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating
    losses and credits prior to utilization. The deferred tax assets
    as of January 3, 2010 are net of any previous limitations
    due to Section 382 and 383.

Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
    recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.
    When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to
    share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows
    the

with-and-without

approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax
    deductions. Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to
    share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until
    after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the
    Company. During 2009, the Company realized $39.3 million of
    such excess tax benefits, and accordingly recorded a
    corresponding credit to additional paid in capital. As of
    January 3, 2010, the Company has $17.1 million of
    unrealized excess tax benefits associated with share-based
    compensation. These tax benefits will be accounted for as a
    credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized,
    rather than a reduction of the provision for income taxes.

The Company’s manufacturing operations in Singapore operate
    under various tax holidays and incentives that begin to expire
    in 2018. For the year ended January 3, 2010, these tax
    holidays and incentives resulted in an approximate
    $2.3 million decrease to the provision for income taxes and
    an increase to net income per diluted share of $0.02.

Residual U.S. income taxes have not been provided on
    $38.6 million of undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries as of January 3, 2010, since the earnings are
    considered to be indefinitely invested in the operations of such
    subsidiaries.

    Company’s uncertain tax positions (in thousands):

During 2009 the Company determined that $14.4 million of
    previously reported uncertain tax positions, which related to
    pre-acquistion net operating loss carryforwards of Solexa, were
    not uncertain as of the Solexa acquisition in January 2007.
    Accordingly, the uncertain tax position balances that were
    previously reported have been reduced by $14.4 million to
    correctly present the uncertain tax position balances.

ILLUMINA,

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of January 3, 2010, $9.6 million of the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions would reduce the
    Company’s annual effective tax rate, if recognized.

The Company does not expect its uncertain tax positions to
    change significantly over the next 12 months. Any interest
    and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be
    reflected in income tax expense. As of January 3, 2010, no
    interest or penalties have been accrued related to the
    Company’s uncertain tax positions. Tax years 1995 to 2009
    remain subject to future examination by the major tax
    jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Retirement
    Plan

The Company has a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all
    of its employees. Company contributions to the plan are
    discretionary. During the years ended January 3, 2010,
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, the Company
    made matching contributions of $3.3 million,
    $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plan

For the Company’s executives and members of the board of
    directors, the Company adopted the Illumina, Inc. Deferred
    Compensation Plan (the Plan) that became effective
    January 1, 2008. Eligible participants can contribute up to
    80% of their base salary and 100% of all other forms of
    compensation into the Plan, including bonus, commission and
    director fees. The Company has agreed to credit the
    participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the
    performance of certain independent investment funds. On a
    discretionary basis, the Company may also make employer
    contributions to participant accounts in any amount determined
    by the Company. The vesting schedules of employer contributions
    are at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.
    However, all employer contributions shall become 100% vested
    upon the occurrence of the participant’s disability, death
    or retirement or a change in control of the Company. The
    benefits under this plan are unsecured. Participants are
    generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at
    the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of
    their employment with the Company for any reason or at a later
    date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. As of
    January 3, 2010, no employer contributions were made to the
    Plan.

In January 2008, the Company also established a rabbi trust for
    the benefit of its directors and executives under the Plan. In
    accordance with authoritative guidance related to consolidation
    of variable interest entities and accounting for deferred
    compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a
    rabbi trust and invested, the Company has included the assets of
    the rabbi trust in its consolidated balance sheet since the
    trust’s inception. As of January 3, 2010, the assets
    of the trust and liabilities of the Company were
    $4.0 million. The assets and liabilities are classified as
    other assets and accrued liabilities, respectively, on the
    Company’s balance sheet as of January 3, 2010. Changes
    in the values of the assets held by the rabbi trust accrue to
    the Company.
