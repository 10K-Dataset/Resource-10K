PART I

ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview

We are the global leader in sequencing-and array-based solutions for genetic analysis.  Our solutions serve customers in a wide range of markets, enabling the broad adoption of genomics solutions in research and clinical settings.  We were incorporated in California in April 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in July 2000.  Our principal executive offices are located at 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, California 92122.  Our telephone number is (858) 202-4500.

Our customers include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, hospitals, and reference laboratories as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, commercial molecular diagnostic, and consumer genomics companies.

Our portfolio of integrated systems, consumables, and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis.  This portfolio addresses a range of genomic complexity, price points, and throughput, enabling customers to select the best solution for their research or clinical challenge.  Our leading-edge sequencing instruments can efficiently perform a broad range of nucleic-acid (DNA, RNA) analyses across a wide range of sample sizes.

To provide our customers with more comprehensive sample-to-answer solutions, we acquired several companies: NextBio, a leader in clinical and genomic informatics, in November 2013, Advanced Liquid Logic Inc., a leader in digital microfluidics and liquid handling solutions, in July 2013, and Epicentre Technologies Corporation, a leading provider of nucleic-acid sample preparation reagents and specialty enzymes for sequencing and array applications, in January 2011.

Over the last few years, we have made key acquisitions to enable our goal of becoming a leader in the clinical market.  These include Myraqa, Inc. in July 2014, Verinata Health, Inc. in February 2013, and BlueGnome Ltd. in September 2012.  Our acquisition of Myraqa bolstered our regulatory and quality capabilities and enhanced our leadership team in molecular and companion diagnostics.  The acquisition of Verinata strengthened our reproductive health portfolio by adding the Verinata verifi prenatal test, a comprehensive noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) for high-risk pregnancies.  Our acquisition of BlueGnome, a leading provider of genetic solutions for screening chromosomal abnormalities and genetic variations associated with developmental delay and infertility, expanded our ability to offer integrated solutions in reproductive health and cancer.

Genetics Primer

The instruction set for all living cells is encoded in deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.  The complete set of DNA for any organism is referred to as its genome.  DNA contains small regions called genes, which comprise a string of nucleotide bases labeled A, C, G, and T, representing adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, respectively.  These nucleotide bases occur in a precise order known as the DNA sequence.  When a gene is “expressed,” a partial copy of its DNA sequence called messenger RNA (mRNA) is used as a template to direct the synthesis of a particular protein.  Proteins, in turn, direct all cellular function.  The illustration below is a simplified gene expression schematic.



Variations among organisms are due, in large part, to differences in their DNA sequences.  Changes can result from insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations, or duplications of nucleotide bases.  These changes may result in certain genes becoming over-expressed (excessive protein production), under-expressed (reduced protein production), or silenced altogether, sometimes triggering changes in cellular function.  These changes can be the result of heredity, but most often they occur at random.  The most common form of variation in humans is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is a base change in a single position in a DNA sequence.  Another type of variation, copy number variations (CNVs), occur when there are fewer or more copies of certain genes, segments of a gene, or stretches of DNA.

In humans, genetic variation accounts for many of the physical differences we see (e.g., height, hair, eye color, etc.).  Genetic variations also can have medical consequences affecting disease susceptibility, including predisposition to complex genetic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.  They can affect individual response to certain drug treatments, causing patients to experience adverse side effects, or to respond well or not at all.

Scientists are studying these variations and their consequences in humans, as well as in a broad range of animals, plants, and microorganisms.

Such research takes place in government, university, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and agrigenomics laboratories around the world, where scientists expand our knowledge of the biological functions essential for life.  Beginning at the genetic level, Illumina tools are used to elucidate the correlation between gene sequence and biological processes.  Life-science research includes the study of the cells, tissues, organs, systems, and other components of living organisms.  This research supports the development of new treatments to improve human health.  Examples include more tailored clinical treatments, often referred to as precision medicine, as well as advances in agriculture and animal husbandry to meet growing needs for food and energy.  Researchers who investigate human, viral, and bacterial genetic variation to understand the mechanisms of disease are enabling the development of more effective diagnostics and therapeutics.  They also provide greater insight into genetic variation in plants (e.g., food and biofuel crops) and animals (e.g., livestock and domestic), enabling improvements in crop yields and animal breeding programs.

By empowering genetic analysis and facilitating a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function, our tools advance disease research, drug development, and the creation of molecular diagnostic tests.  We believe that this will trigger a fundamental shift in the practice of medicine and health care.  The increased emphasis on preventive and predictive molecular medicine will usher in the era of precision health care.

Our Principal Markets

Our business units are aligned to target the markets and customers outlined below.

Life Sciences

Historically, our core business has been in the life sciences research market, which includes laboratories associated with universities, medical research centers, and government institutions, along with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.  Researchers at these institutions use our products and services in a broad spectrum of scientific activities for basic analysis and research, including

de novo

sequencing, genetic variation analysis, gene expression analysis, epigenetics, genome wide association studies, and targeted screening.  Increasingly, these techniques are migrating to next-generation sequencing (NGS) due to the improved performance, reduced complexity, and declining costs of NGS technologies.  Both private and public funding drive this research, along with global initiatives to characterize genetic variation and the migration of legacy genetic applications to sequencing-based technologies.

We also provide products and services for other life sciences applied markets such as agrigenomics.  Government and corporate researchers use our sequencing and array-based tools to accelerate and enhance agricultural research.  Identifying desirable traits in plants and animals leads to healthier and more productive crops and livestock.

Reproductive and Genetic Health

Illumina technologies and products provide reproductive-health solutions, including preimplantation genetic screening (PGS), preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and neonatal and genetic health testing.  Our PGS solutions are used with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to determine, before implantation, whether an embryo has an abnormal number of chromosomes, which is a major cause of IVF failure and miscarriages.  Our PGD solutions identify, before implantation, which embryos are free from gene variants associated with genetic diseases.  Our NIPT solutions provide noninvasive tests for early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing cell-free DNA in maternal blood.



Oncology

Cancer is a disease of the genome, and the goal of cancer genomics is to identify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one.  Understanding these genomic changes allow for a more accurate diagnosis, a better understanding of the prognosis, and the ability to target therapies to individuals.  Researchers and clinicians in the research, translational, and clinical oncology markets use Illumina sequencing and array-based solutions to identify the molecular changes in a tumor during all stages of tumor progression.  Our solutions help transform discoveries into new treatments or therapies and create tests to predict patient response.

To advance genomic-based precision health care, we are working with leading pharmaceutical companies to develop a universal NGS-based oncology test system for clinical trials of targeted cancer therapies.  The goal is to develop and commercialize a multi-gene panel for “companion therapeutic” selection.  We are also working with key thought leaders to set standards for NGS-based assays in routine clinical oncology practice and to define regulatory frameworks for this new testing paradigm.

Enterprise Informatics

Enterprise informatics solutions increase the utility of genomic data by allowing customers to aggregate, analyze, archive, and share genomic data.  Integrating our instruments with data-analysis software solutions allows customers to go from their biological sample, through the raw genomic data, to meaningful results.  Our BaseSpace platform, which can be hosted onsite or in the cloud, integrates directly with our sequencing instruments.  It facilitates data sharing, provides data storage solutions, and streamlines sequencing-data analysis through a growing number of data-analysis applications from Illumina and the bioinformatics community.

In 2013, we acquired NextBio, which provides a platform for aggregating and analyzing large quantities of genomic and phenotypic data.  Translational research uses this approach to optimize drug therapies and identify trends in overall patient outcomes.  We believe that large-scale genomic databases containing genomic and phenotypic information will enhance the value of human genome sequencing and accelerate the pace of discovery.

New and Emerging Opportunities

Our markets change rapidly in response to genomic innovations.  New applications and opportunities develop and evolve quickly.  We assess these against our corporate strategies and consider whether there is a compelling unmet need together with a strong opportunity to transform the market.  Some of the markets that provide immediate and near-term opportunities to expand the use of next-generation sequencing include:

•

Transplant diagnostics, where sequencing is used to evaluate donor and patient compatibility;

•

Forensic genomics, where sequencing is used to investigate criminal cases; and

•

Consumer genomics, where genotyping is used primarily to reveal ancestry and genealogical linkage information.

Our Principal Products and Technologies

Our unique technology platforms support the scale of experimentation necessary for population-scale studies, genome-wide discovery, target selection, and validation studies (see Figure 1 below).  Customers use our products to analyze the genome at all levels of complexity, from whole-genome sequencing to targeted panels.  A large and dynamic Illumina user community has published more than 10,000 customer-authored scientific papers using our technologies.  Through rapid innovation, we are changing the economics of genetic research, enabling projects that were previously considered impossible, and supporting clinical advances towards precision medicine.

Most of our product sales consist of instruments and consumables (which include reagents, flow cells, and microarrays) based on our proprietary technologies.  For the fiscal years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

December 30, 2012

, instrument sales comprised

30%

Figure 1: Illumina Platform Overview:

Sequencing

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the order of nucleotide bases (A, C, G, or T) in a DNA sample.  Our portfolio of sequencing platforms represents a family of systems that we believe set the standard for productivity, cost-effectiveness, and accuracy among NGS technologies.  Customers use our platforms to perform whole-genome,

de novo

, and exome sequencing, and targeted resequencing of specific gene regions and genes.

Whole-genome sequencing determines the complete DNA sequence of an organism.  In

de novo

sequencing, the goal is to sequence and analyze a sample without using information from prior sequencing of that species.  In targeted resequencing, a portion of the sequence of an organism is compared to a standard or reference sequence from previously sequenced samples to identify genetic variation.  Understanding the similarities and differences in DNA sequence between and within species helps us understand the function of the structures encoded in the DNA.

Our DNA sequencing technology is based on our proprietary reversible terminator-based sequencing chemistry, referred to as sequencing by synthesis (SBS) biochemistry.  SBS tracks the addition of labeled nucleotides as the DNA chain is copied in a massively parallel fashion.  Our SBS sequencing technology provides researchers with a broad range of applications and the ability to sequence even large mammalian genomes in days rather than weeks or years.

Our sequencing platforms can generate between 500 megabases (Mb) and 1.8 terabases (Tb) (equivalent to 16 human genomes) of genomic data, depending on the instrument and application.  There are different price points per gigabase (Gb) for each instrument, and for different applications, which range from small-genome, amplicon, and targeted gene-panel sequencing to population-scale whole human genome sequencing.  Since we launched our first sequencing system in 2007, our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by more than a factor of 10,000.  In addition, the sequencing time per Gb has dropped by a factor of nearly 2,000.

Arrays

Arrays are used for a broad range of DNA and RNA analysis applications, including SNP genotyping, CNV analysis, gene expression analysis, and methylation analysis, and allows for the detection of up to 5,000,000 known genetic markers on a single array.

Our BeadArray technology combines microscopic beads and a substrate in a proprietary manufacturing process to produce arrays that can perform many assays simultaneously.   This facilitates large-scale analysis of genetic variation and biological function in a uniquely high-throughput, cost-effective, and flexible manner.  Using our BeadArray technology, we achieve high-throughput analysis via a high density of test sites per array and the ability to format arrays in various configurations.  We maximize cost effectiveness by reducing expensive consumables, valuable sample input requirements, and manufacturing costs. Varying the size, shape, and format of the well patterns and creating specific beadpools for different



applications lets us address multiple markets and market segments.  Our HiScan and iScan array scanner systems, and our NextSeq 550 system, which we announced in January 2015, image the arrays.

Consumables

We have developed various library preparation and sequencing kits to simplify workflows and accelerate analysis.  Our sequencing applications include whole-genome sequencing kits, which sequence entire genomes of any size and complexity, and targeted resequencing kits, which can sequence exomes, specific genes, or other genomic regions of interest.  Our sequencing kits maximize the ability of our customers to characterize the target genome accurately.  Through our acquisition of Epicentre Technologies Corporation in 2011, we acquired the proprietary Nextera technology for next-generation sequencing library preparation.  This technology has enabled us to reduce sample input requirements, simplify genetic analysis workflows, and significantly reduce the time from sample preparation to answer.

Customers use Illumina array-based genotyping consumables for a wide range of analyses, including diverse species, disease-related mutations, and genetic characteristics associated with cancer.  Customers can select from a range of human, animal, and agriculturally relevant genome panels or create their own custom arrays to investigate up to 5,000,000 genetic markers targeting any species.

Our Services

In addition to selling products, we provide genotyping, NIPT, and whole-genome sequencing services.  Human whole-genome sequencing services are provided through our CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory.  We began offering genotyping services to academic institutions, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical customers in 2002, and added sequencing services in 2007.  Using our FastTrack services, customers can perform whole-genome sequencing projects (including phasing and long-read sequencing services) and microarray projects (including large-scale genotyping studies and whole-genome association studies).  We also provide NIPT services through our partner laboratories that direct samples to us on a test send-out basis.

Intellectual Property

We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio.  As of February 1, 2015, we own or have exclusive licenses to 473 issued U.S. patents and 421 pending U.S. patent applications, including 19 allowed applications that have not yet issued as patents.  Our issued patents cover various aspects of our arrays, assays, oligo synthesis, sequencing technology, instruments, digital microfluidics, and chemical-detection technologies, and have terms that expire between 2015 and 2035.  We continue to file new patent applications to protect the full range of our technologies.  We have filed or have been granted counterparts for many of these patents and applications in foreign countries.

We protect trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.  Our success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and processes, preserving trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, operating without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and acquiring licenses for technology or products.

We are party to various exclusive and nonexclusive license agreements and other arrangements with third parties that grant us rights to use key aspects of our sequencing and array technologies, assay methods, chemical detection methods, reagent kits, and scanning equipment.  Our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents, which will occur between 2015 and 2030.  We have additional nonexclusive license agreements with various third parties for other components of our products.  In most cases, the agreements remain in effect over the term of the underlying patents, may be terminated at our request without further obligation, and require that we pay customary royalties.

Research and Development

Illumina has historically made substantial investments in research and development.  Our research and development efforts prioritize continuous innovation coupled with product evolution.

Research and development expenses for fiscal


,


, and


were

$388.1 million

,

$276.7 million

, and

$231.0 million

, respectively.  We expect research and development expense to increase during


to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and product-development efforts.



Marketing and Distribution

We market and distribute our products directly to customers in North America, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.  In each of these areas, dedicated sales, service, and application-support personnel are expanding and supporting their respective customer bases.  In addition, we sell through life-science distributors in certain markets within Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa.  We expect to continue increasing our sales and distribution resources during


and beyond as we launch new products and expand our potential customer base.

Manufacturing

Illumina manufactures sequencing and array platforms, reagent kits, and scanning equipment.  In 2014, we continued to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand.  To address increasing product complexity and volume, we are automating manufacturing processes to accelerate throughput and improve quality and yield.  Illumina is committed to providing medical devices and related services that consistently meet customer and applicable regulatory requirements.  We adhere to access and safety standards required by federal, state, and local health ordinances, such as standards for the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous substances.  Our key manufacturing and distribution facilities operate under a quality management system certified to ISO 13485.

Raw Materials

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials, electronic and mechanical components, chemical and biochemical materials, and other supplies.  Multiple commercial sources provide many of our components and supplies, but there are some raw materials and components that we obtain from single-source suppliers.  To manage potential risks arising from single source suppliers, we believe that we could redesign our products using alternative components or for use with alternative reagents, if necessary.  In addition, while we attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.  If the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to disasters, quality, regulatory, or other reasons, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products.

Competition

Although we believe that our products and services provide significant advantages over products and services currently available from other sources, we expect continued intense competition.  Our competitors offer products and services for sequencing, SNP genotyping, gene expression, and molecular diagnostics markets.  They include companies such as Affymetrix, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., BGI, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., QIAGEN N.V., Roche Holding AG., and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., among others.  Some of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial, technical, research, and other resources than we do, along with larger, more established marketing, sales, distribution, and service organizations.  In addition, they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we address, and in some cases a larger installed base of systems.  We expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase.  To compete effectively, we must scale our organization and infrastructure appropriately and demonstrate that our products have superior throughput, cost, and accuracy.

Segment and Geographic Information

In accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance for segment reporting, we have determined that we have one reportable segment for purposes of recording and reporting our financial results.

We currently sell our products to a number of customers outside the United States, including customers in other areas of North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.  Shipments to customers outside the United States totaled

$910.7 million

, or

49%

of our total revenue, during fiscal


, compared to

$706.5 million

, or

50%

, and

$580.1 million

, or

51%

, in fiscal


and


, respectively.  The U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional currency of the Company’s international operations due to the primary activities of our foreign subsidiaries.  We expect that sales to international customers will continue to be an important and growing source of revenue.  See note “13. Segment Information, Geographic Data, and Significant Customers” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information concerning our foreign and domestic operations.



Backlog

Our backlog was approximately

$540 million

and

$330 million

as of

December 28, 2014

, and

December 29, 2013

, respectively.  Approximately $130 million of our backlog as of

December 28, 2014

, was associated with the Genomics England sequencing services project, the delivery of which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.  Generally, our backlog consists of orders believed to be firm as of the balance-sheet date.  However, we may allow customers to make product substitutions as we launch new products.  The timing of shipments depends on several factors, including agreed upon shipping schedules, which may span multiple quarters, and whether the product is catalog or custom.  We expect most of the backlog as of

December 28, 2014

, to be shipped within the fiscal year ending

January 3, 2016

, with the exception of the Genomics England backlog.  Although we generally recognize revenue upon the transfer of title to a customer, some customer agreements or applicable accounting treatments might require us to defer the recognition of revenue beyond title transfer.

Environmental Matters

We are committed to the protection of our employees and the environment.  Our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal, state, and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.  We believe that we are in material compliance with current applicable laws and regulations.  However, we could be held liable for damages and fines should contamination of the environment or individual exposures to hazardous substances occur.  In addition, we cannot predict how changes in these laws and regulations, or the development of new laws and regulations, will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.

Government Regulation

As we expand product lines to address the diagnosis of disease, regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will become an increasingly significant factor in development, testing, production, and marketing.  Products that we develop in the molecular diagnostic markets, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries.  In the United States, certain of our products may require FDA clearance following a pre-market notification process, also known as a 510(k) clearance, or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA before marketing.  The shorter 510(k) clearance process, which we used for the FDA-cleared assays that are run on our FDA-regulated MiSeqDx instrument, generally takes from three to six months after submission, but it can take significantly longer.  The longer PMA process is much more costly and uncertain.  It generally takes from 9 to 18 months after a complete filing, but it can take significantly longer and typically requires conducting clinical studies, which are not always needed for a 510(k) clearance.  All of the products that are currently regulated by the FDA as medical devices are also subject to the FDA Quality System Regulation (QSR).  Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals, including the FDA quality system inspections that are required for PMA approval, can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.

We cannot be certain which of our planned molecular diagnostic products will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process and, in fact, some of our products may need to go through the PMA process.  The regulatory approval process for such products may be significantly delayed, may be significantly more expensive than anticipated, and may conclude without such products being approved by the FDA.  Without timely regulatory approval, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products.

Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products.  This may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products.  In addition, the FDA may introduce new requirements that may change the regulatory requirements for either or both Illumina or Illumina customers.

If our products labeled as “Research Use Only,” or RUO, are used, or could be used, for the diagnosis of disease, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling, and supporting such products could be uncertain.  This is true even if such use by our customers occurs without our consent.  If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Illumina products sold as medical devices in Europe will be regulated under the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive (98/79/EC).  This regulation includes requirements for both presentation and review of performance data and quality-system requirements.

Certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) of 1988.  These products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests,” or



LDTs.  For a number of years, the FDA has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate LDTs as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory.  However, as discussed in more detail under “Risk Factors,” the FDA is reexamining this regulatory approach and changes to the agency’s handling of LDTs could impact our business in ways that cannot be predicted at this time.  Certification of CLIA laboratories includes standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, and quality control procedures. CLIA also mandates that, for high complexity labs such as ours, to operate as a lab, we must have an accreditation by an organization recognized by CLIA such as the College of Pathologists (CAP), which we have obtained and must maintain.  If we were to lose our CAP accreditation, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, state laboratory licensing and inspection requirements may also apply to our products, which, in some cases, are more stringent than CLIA requirements.

Employees

As of

December 28, 2014

, we had

more than 3,700

employees.  We consider our employee relations to be positive.  Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees.  In addition, we employ a number of temporary and contract employees.  We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities, and other organizations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors.

Our business is subject to various risks, including those described below.  In addition to the other information included in this Form 10-K, the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price.

If we do not successfully manage the development, manufacturing, and launch of new products or

services, including product transitions, our financial results could be adversely

affected.

We face risks associated with launching new products and pre-announcing products and services when the products or services have not been fully developed or tested.  If our products and services are not able to deliver the performance or results expected by our target markets or are not delivered on a timely basis, our reputation and credibility may suffer.  If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle, we may delay the product launch date.  The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

In addition, we may experience difficulty in managing or forecasting customer reactions, purchasing decisions, or transition requirements or programs with respect to newly launched products (or products in development), which could adversely affect sales of our existing products.  For instance, in January 2015 we announced significant expansions to our sequencing instrument platforms, the HiSeq X Five system and the HiSeq 3000/4000 systems.  When we introduce new or enhanced products, we face numerous risks relating to product transitions, including the inability to accurately forecast demand (including with respect to our existing products), manage excess and obsolete inventories, address new or higher product cost structures, and manage different sales and support requirements due to the type or complexity of the new or enhanced products.  Announcements of currently planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing our products until new products become available.  Our failure to effectively manage product transitions or introductions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We face intense competition, which could render our products obsolete, result in significant price reductions, or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell.

We compete with life sciences companies that design, manufacture, and market products for analysis of genetic variation and biological function and other applications using a wide-range of competing technologies.  We anticipate that we will continue to face increased competition as existing companies develop new or improved products and as new companies enter the market with new technologies.  One or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources, broader product lines, a more established customer base, and more experience in research and development than we do.  Furthermore, life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, which are our potential customers and strategic partners, could also develop competing products.  We believe that customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their initial supplier of a particular product; therefore, it may be difficult to generate sales to potential customers who have purchased products from competitors.  To the extent we are unable to be the first to develop or supply new products, our competitive position may suffer.



The market for molecular diagnostics products is currently limited and highly competitive, with several large companies already having significant market share, intellectual property portfolios, and regulatory expertise.  Established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets, including clinical and reference laboratories, which could deter acceptance of our products.  In addition, some of these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies that provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests.

Our success depends upon the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function.

We design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences, diagnostic, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries.  The usefulness of our technologies depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease.  We are focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and biological function, namely sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression profiling.  These markets are new and emerging, and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate, or reach their full potential.  Other methods of analysis of genetic variation and biological function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing.  Also, researchers may not be able to successfully analyze raw genetic data or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information. In addition, factors affecting research and development spending generally, such as changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions, could harm our business.  If useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner, demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect.

Our continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and commercializing new

products.

Our target markets are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer needs, existing and emerging competition, strong price competition, and frequent new product introductions.  Accordingly, our continued growth depends on developing and commercializing new products and services, including improving our existing products and services, in order to address evolving market requirements on a timely basis.  If we fail to innovate or adequately invest in new technologies, our products and services will become dated, and we could lose our competitive position in the markets that we serve as customers purchase new products offered by our competitors.  We believe that successfully introducing new products and technologies in our target markets on a timely basis provides a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product and may be reluctant to switch once that selection is made.

To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products, or such products are not accepted in the market or suffer significant delays in development, we may lose market share to our competitors, which will be difficult or impossible to regain.  An inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis could reduce our growth rate or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.  In the past, we have experienced, and are likely to experience in the future, delays in the development and introduction of new products.  There can be no assurance that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in our markets or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace, achieve market acceptance, or compete successfully with competing technologies.  Some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products and services include:

•

availability, quality, and price relative to competing products and services;

•

the functionality and performance of new and existing products and services;

•

the timing of introduction of new products or services relative to competing products and services;

•

scientists’ and customers’ opinions of the utility of new products or services;

•

citation of new products or services in published research;

•

regulatory trends and approvals; and

•

general trends in life sciences research and applied markets.

We may also have to write off excess or obsolete inventory if sales of our products are not consistent with our expectations or the market requirements for our products change due to technical innovations in the marketplace.



If defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, our products may be subject to recalls, customers may not purchase our products, our reputation may suffer, and ultimately our

sales and operating earnings could be negatively

impacted.

Our products incorporate complex, precision-manufactured mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components, and fluidics, as well as computer software, any of which may contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced.  In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products.  In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment.  Identifying the root cause of quality issues, particularly those affecting reagents and third-party components, may be difficult, which increases the time needed to address quality issues as they arise and increases the risk that similar problems could recur.  Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex genomic analysis, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects.  If we do not meet applicable regulatory or quality standards, our products may be subject to recall, and, under certain circumstances, we may be required to notify applicable regulatory authorities about a recall.  If our products are subject to recall or shipment holds, our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Litigation, other proceedings, or third party claims of intellectual property

infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent

us from selling our products or services.

Our success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties.  Third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization.  As we enter new markets or introduce new products, we expect that competitors will likely claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful competition.  In addition, third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents.  We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims.  Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have an adverse impact on our stock price, which may be disproportionate to the actual impact of the ruling itself.  Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which effectively could block our ability to develop further, commercialize, or sell products or services, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us.  In the event of a successful infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products or services.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all.  We could therefore incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins and earnings per share.  In addition, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products.  Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products or services could adversely affect our ability to grow or maintain profitability.

We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for some of our products, or components and materials

used in our products, and if shipments from these manufacturers or suppliers are

delayed or interrupted, or if the quality of the products, components, or materials supplied do

not meet our requirements, we may not be able to launch, manufacture, or ship our

products in a timely manner, or at all.

The complex nature of our products requires customized, precision-manufactured components and materials that currently are available from a limited number of sources, and, in the case of some components and materials, from only a single source.  If deliveries from these vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason, or if we are otherwise unable to secure a sufficient supply, we may not be able to obtain these components or materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities or qualities, or at all, in order to meet demand for our products.  We may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial-scale production of some of our products, or develop these capabilities internally, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do this on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier.  The time and effort required to qualify a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources, or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results.  Accordingly, we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable, high-volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs or at all.  In addition, the manufacture or shipment of our products may be delayed or interrupted if the quality of the products, components, or materials supplied by our vendors does not meet our requirements.  Current or future social and environmental regulations or critical issues, such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the need to eliminate environmentally sensitive materials from our products, could restrict the supply



of components and materials used in production or increase our costs.  Any delay or interruption to our manufacturing process or in shipping our products could result in lost revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.

As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.  As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen, including interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality.  Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders, and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.  In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins.  As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Reduction or delay in research and development budgets and government funding may adversely affect our revenue.

The timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government and academic research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, and there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the United States and Europe, in particular, focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting uncertain economic growth.  Funding for life science research has increased more slowly during the past several years compared to previous years and has declined in some countries.  Government funding of research and development is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.  Other programs, such as defense, entitlement programs, or general efforts to reduce budget deficits could be viewed by governments as a higher priority.  These budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to government agencies that fund research and development activities, such as the U.S. National Institute of Health, or NIH.  Past proposals to reduce budget deficits have included reduced NIH and other research and development allocations.  Any shift away from the funding of life sciences research and development or delays surrounding the approval of government budget proposals may cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our acquisitions expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, and we

may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or

technologies.

As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products, services, and technologies, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions of technologies, products, or businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations:

•

difficulties in integrating new operations, technologies, products, and personnel;

•

lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings;

•

difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations;

•

underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;

•

negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;

•

the potential loss of key employees, customers, and strategic partners of acquired companies;

•

claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;

•

the issuance of dilutive securities, assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;

•

diversion of management’s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business;



•

inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies;

•

the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies; and

•

assumption of, or exposure to, unknown contingent liabilities or liabilities that are difficult to identify or accurately quantify.

In addition, the successful integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal, and information technologies.  There can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we make will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable.  Our failure to successfully address the above risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits from any acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.

If we are unable to increase our manufacturing or service capacity and develop and maintain

operation of our manufacturing or service capability, we may not be able to launch or support

our products or services in a timely manner, or at all.

We continue to rapidly increase our manufacturing and service capacity to meet the anticipated demand for our products.  Although we have significantly increased our manufacturing and service capacity and we believe we have plans in place sufficient to ensure we have adequate capacity to meet our current business plans, there are uncertainties inherent in expanding our manufacturing and service capabilities, and we may not be able to sufficiently increase our capacity in a timely manner.  For example, manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facilities and launch new products.  Also, we may not manufacture the right product mix to meet customer demand, especially as we introduce new products.  As a result, we may experience difficulties in meeting customer, collaborator, and internal demand, in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions, and demand for our products could decline.  Additionally, in the past, we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions and quality control issues that have temporarily reduced or suspended production of certain products.  Due to the intricate nature of manufacturing complex instruments, consumables, and products that contain DNA, we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields, impact our ability to launch or sell these products (or to produce them economically), prevent us from achieving expected performance levels, or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers.

An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials due to a catastrophic disaster or infrastructure could adversely affect our business.

We currently manufacture in a limited number of locations.  Our manufacturing facilities are located in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area in California; Madison, Wisconsin; and Singapore.  These areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or floods.  If a natural disaster were to damage one of our facilities significantly or if other events were to cause our operations to fail, we may be unable to manufacture our products, provide our services, or develop new products.  In addition, if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped, due to disasters, quality, regulatory, or other reasons, it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products.

Many of our manufacturing processes are automated and are controlled by our custom-designed laboratory information management system (LIMS).  Additionally, the decoding process in our array manufacturing requires significant network and storage infrastructure.  If either our LIMS system or our networks or storage infrastructure were to fail for an extended period of time, it may adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis and could prevent us from achieving our expected shipments in any given period.

We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers; sell our products and services; fulfill orders; bill, collect, and make payments; ship products; provide services and support to customers; fulfill contractual obligations; and otherwise conduct business.  Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.  .  Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.  Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.



If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional

personnel, we may be unable to achieve our goals.

We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including Jay Flatley, our Chief Executive Officer.  The loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.  In addition, the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology, chemistry, biological information processing, sales, marketing, and technical support.  We compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies, universities, and research institutions, particularly those focusing on genomics.  Competition for these individuals, particularly in the San Diego and San Francisco areas, is intense, and the turnover rate can be high.  Failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies.  Additionally, integration of acquired companies and businesses can be disruptive, causing key employees of the acquired business to leave.  Further, we use share-based compensation, including restricted stock units and performance stock units to attract key personnel, incentivize them to remain with us, and align their interests with those of the Company by building long-term stockholder value.  If our stock price decreases, the value of these equity awards decreases and therefore reduces a key employee’s incentive to stay.

Any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technologies could harm our

competitive position.

The proprietary positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences, genomics, forensics, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries, including our proprietary position, generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions.  Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the United States and other countries.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant challenges in establishing and enforcing their proprietary rights outside of the United States.  These challenges can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for the establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights outside of the United States.

We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.  Any finding that our patents or applications are unenforceable could harm our ability to prevent others from practicing the related technology, and a finding that others have inventorship or ownership rights to our patents and applications could require us to obtain certain rights to practice related technologies, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.  Furthermore, as issued patents expire, we may lose some competitive advantage as others develop competing products, and, as a result, we may lose revenue.

In addition, our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and may therefore fail to provide us with any competitive advantage.  We may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, or litigate against third party claims, which would be expensive, and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.  Furthermore, these lawsuits may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel.  There is also the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies.  In that regard, certain patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents issue, and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months.

We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and we have taken security measures to protect this information.  These measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other confidential information.

Security breaches, including with respect to cyber-security, and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks.  The secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy.  Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions.  As a leader in the field of genetic analysis, we may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, including our data centers; sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products, and services; misappropriate our or our customers' and partners' proprietary information, which may include personally identifiable information; or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services.  Any such breach could



compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and damage to our reputation.

Our products, if used for the diagnosis of disease, could be subject to government

regulation, and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may

be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain both in timing and in outcome.

Our products are not subject to FDA clearance or approval if they are not intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease.  However, as we expand our product line to encompass products that are intended to be used for the diagnosis of disease, such as our FDA-regulated MiSeqDx, certain of our products will become subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable international agencies, including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed.  Such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.  In addition, changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required.

Molecular diagnostic products, in particular, depending on their intended use, may be regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the FDA following the 510(k) pre-market notification process or premarket approval from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing.  Obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay.  If we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals for molecular diagnostic products that we develop, we may not be able to launch or successfully commercialize such products in a timely manner, or at all.

In addition, if our products labeled as “Research Use Only,” or RUO, are used, or could be used, for the diagnosis of disease, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling, and supporting such products could be uncertain, even if such use by our customers is without our consent.  If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our RUO products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

If the FDA requires in the future that any of our LDT products be subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

Certain of our diagnostic products are currently available through laboratories that are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) of 1988.  These products are commonly called “laboratory developed tests,” or LDTs.  For a number of years, the FDA has exercised its regulatory enforcement discretion to not regulate LDTs as medical devices if created and used within a single laboratory.  However, the FDA has been reconsidering its enforcement discretion policy and has commented that regulation of LDTs may be warranted because of the growth in the volume and complexity of testing services utilizing LDTs.  In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents suggesting an approach for registration and listing of laboratories and assays along with a framework for regulation of LDTs by the FDA based on risk to patients rather than whether the LDTs were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory.  The draft framework guidance includes pre-market review for higher-risk LDTs, including many used to guide treatment decisions, as well as companion diagnostics that have entered the market as LDTs.  We cannot predict the nature or extent of the FDA's final guidance or regulation of LDTs, in general, or with respect to our LDTs, in particular.  If the FDA requires in the future that LDT products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

If product or service liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities.

Our products and services are used for sensitive applications, and we face an inherent risk of exposure to product or service liability claims if our products or services are alleged to have caused harm, resulted in false negatives or false positives, or do not perform in accordance with specifications.  We cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product or service liability lawsuit brought against us.  Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product or service liability claims may result in:

•

decreased demand for our products;



•

injury to our reputation;

•

increased product liability insurance costs;

•

costs of related litigation; and

•

substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.

Although we carry product and service liability insurance, if we become the subject of a successful product or service liability lawsuit, our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

As we develop, market, or sell diagnostic tests, we may encounter delays in receipt, or limits in the amount, of reimbursement approvals and public health funding, which will impact our ability to grow revenues in the healthcare market.

Physicians and patients may not order diagnostic tests that we develop, market, or sell, such as our verifi prenatal test, unless third-party payors, such as managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and governmental payors outside of the United States, pay a substantial portion of the test price.  Third-party payors are often reluctant to reimburse healthcare providers for the use of medical tests that involve new technologies or provide novel diagnostic information.  In addition, third-party payors are increasingly limiting reimbursement coverage for medical diagnostic products and, in many instances, are exerting pressure on diagnostic product suppliers to reduce their prices.  Reimbursement by a payor may depend on a number of factors, including a payor's determination that tests using our technologies are:

•

not experimental  or investigational,

•

medically necessary,

•

appropriate for the specific patient,

•

cost-effective,

•

supported by peer-reviewed publications, and

•

included in clinical practice guidelines.

Since each third-party payor often makes reimbursement decisions on an individual patient basis, obtaining such approvals is a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical data supporting the clinical benefits of each of our products.  As a result, there can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be obtained.  This process can delay the broad market introduction of new products, and could have a negative effect on our results of operations.  As a result, third-party reimbursement may not be consistent or financially adequate to cover the cost of diagnostic products that we develop, market, or sell.  This could limit our ability to sell our products or cause us to reduce prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations.

Even if our tests are being reimbursed, third party payors may withdraw their coverage policies, cancel their contracts with our customers at any time, review and adjust the rate of reimbursement, require co-payments from patients, or stop paying for our tests, which would reduce our revenues.  In addition, insurers, including managed care organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of healthcare services.  These measures have resulted in reduced payment rates and decreased utilization for the clinical laboratory industry.  Reductions in the reimbursement rate of payors may occur in the future.  Reductions in the prices at which our tests are reimbursed could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

Doing business internationally creates operational and financial risks for our

business.

Conducting and launching operations on an international scale requires close coordination of activities across multiple jurisdictions and time zones and consumes significant management resources.  If we fail to coordinate and manage these activities effectively, including the risks noted below, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.  We have sales offices located internationally throughout Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Brazil, as well as manufacturing facilities in Singapore.  Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised

49%

,

50%

, and

51%

of our total revenue for fiscal years


,


, and


, respectively.



During


, a significant portion of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies while the majority of our purchases of raw materials were denominated in U.S. dollars.  Changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations.  Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we are able sell products in the same market.  Our revenues from international customers may be negatively impacted as increases in the U.S. dollar relative to our international customers local currency could make our products more expensive, impacting our ability to compete.  Our costs of materials from international suppliers may increase if in order to continue doing business with us they raise their prices as the value of the U.S. dollar decreases relative to their local currency.  Foreign policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the United States and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations.  Recent global financial conditions have led to a high level of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and that level of volatility may continue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing risks, international operations entail the following risks:

•

longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the United States;

•

longer sales cycles due to the volume of transactions taking place through public tenders;

•

challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we sell our products;

•

difficulties in obtaining export licenses or in overcoming other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays; and

•

significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws.

We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgments based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations are required in determining the provision for income taxes.  Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in existing tax laws or tax rates, changes in the level of non-deductible expenses (including share-based compensation), changes in our future levels of research and development spending, mergers and acquisitions, or the result of examinations by various tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the Company on its tax returns, we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties.  If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

An inability to manage our growth or the expansion of our operations could adversely

affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our business has grown rapidly, with total revenues increasing from

$73.5 million

for the year ended January 1, 2006 to

$1.86 billion

for the year ended

December 28, 2014

, and with the number of employees increasing from 375 to

more than 3,700

during the same period.  We expect to continue to experience substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans.  The continued global expansion of our business and addition of new personnel may place a strain on our management and operational systems.  Our ability to effectively manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational, financial, and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees on a global basis.  If we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner, or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls, then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology.  Our future operating results will depend on the ability of our management to continue to implement and improve our research, product development, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and customer support programs, enhance our operational and financial control systems, expand, train, and manage our employee base, integrate acquired businesses, and effectively address new issues related to our growth as they arise.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our recent or any future expansion or acquisition successfully, and any inability to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.



Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, and we may not be

able to sustain operating profitability.

Our revenue is subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products and services, the effects of new product launches and related promotions, the timing and availability of our customers’ funding, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of research projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry, and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns.  Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products and services, we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.  While we anticipate future growth, there is some uncertainty as to the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis.  This is because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is typically recognized in the last month of a quarter and because the pattern for revenue generation during that month is normally not linear, with a concentration of orders in the final weeks of the quarter.  In light of that, our revenue cut-off and recognition procedures, together with our manufacturing and shipping operations, may experience increased pressure and demand during the time period shortly before the end of a fiscal quarter.

A large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed, including expenses for facilities, equipment, and personnel.  In addition, we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly in absolute dollars, and we expect that our research and development and selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the development and launch of new products.  Accordingly, our ability to sustain profitability will depend in part on the rate of growth, if any, of our revenue and on the level of our expenses, and if revenue does not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to maintain annual or quarterly profitability.  Any significant delays in the commercial launch of our products, unfavorable sales trends in our existing product lines, or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our future revenue growth or cause a sequential decline in quarterly revenue.  In addition, non-cash share-based compensation expense and expenses related to prior and future acquisitions are also likely to continue to adversely affect our future profitability.  Due to the possibility of significant fluctuations in our revenue and expenses, particularly from quarter to quarter, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.  If our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.

From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue.  The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales.  As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments

by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our

financial results or financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments.  Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.

Ethical, legal, and social concerns related to the use of genetic information could

reduce demand for our products or services.

Our products may be used to provide genetic information about humans, agricultural crops, other food sources, and other living organisms.  The information obtained from our products could be used in a variety of applications, which may have underlying ethical, legal, and social concerns regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information, including preimplantation genetic screening of embryos, prenatal genetic testing, genetic engineering or modification of agricultural products, or testing genetic predisposition for certain medical conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure.  Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure.  Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible.  These and other ethical, legal, and social concerns about genetic testing may limit market acceptance of our technology for certain applications or reduce the potential markets for our technology, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.



Our strategic investments may result in losses.

We periodically make strategic investments in various public and private companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business.  The market values of these strategic investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control.  Other-than-temporary declines in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies would require us to record losses related to our investment.  This could result in future charges to our earnings.  It is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long-term benefits associated with these strategic investments.

Conversion of our outstanding convertible notes may result in losses.

As of

December 28, 2014

, we had

$320.0 million

aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2016,

$632.5 million

aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2019, and

$517.5 million

aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2021 outstanding.  The notes are convertible into cash, and if applicable, shares of our common stock under certain circumstances, including trading price conditions related to our common stock.  If the trading price of our common stock remains significantly above the conversion price of

$83.55

with respect to convertible notes due 2016, we believe that some noteholders will elect to convert the applicable notes.  Upon conversion, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the notes to be extinguished and their corresponding net carrying value.  The fair value of the notes to be extinguished depends on our current incremental borrowing rate.  The net carrying value of our notes has an implicit interest rate of 4.5% with respect to convertible notes due 2016, 2.9% with respect to convertible notes due 2019, and 3.5% with respect to convertible notes due 2021.  If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is lower than the implied interest rate of the notes, we will record a loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted.

Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that may make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock.

Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make it more difficult to successfully complete a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us.  Our Certificate of Incorporation has provisions that give our Board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval.  The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.  The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock.  In addition, the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control.

In addition, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), including Section 203 of the DGCL, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of Illumina.  Section 203 of the DGCL provides, with certain exceptions, for waiting periods applicable to business combinations with stockholders owning at least 15% and less than 85% of the voting stock (exclusive of stock held by directors, officers, and employee plans) of a company.

The above factors may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of Illumina, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings.

We are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, employment, and contractual matters.  In connection with these matters, we assesses, on a regular basis, the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters.  A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.  We regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures.  The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.  Each matter presents its own unique circumstances, and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome, or range of outcomes, in any individual proceeding.  Because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence, amount, and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim, we are currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome, and, with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  In the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims, any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable, and potentially in future periods.

This MD&A discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for additional factors relating to such statements.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods.

Business Overview and Outlook

We are a global leader in sequencing and array-based solutions, which serve customers in a wide range of markets, enabling the broad adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings.  Our portfolio of integrated systems, consumables, and analysis tools is designed to accelerate and simplify genetic analysis.  This portfolio addresses a range of genomic complexity, price points, and throughput, so that customers can select the best solution for their scientific challenge.  Our leading-edge sequencing and array instruments can perform a broad range of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) analyses efficiently across a wide range of sample sizes.

Financial highlights for


include the following:

•

Net revenue

increased

by

31%

in


compared to


.  Our sales increased across our portfolio of sequencing products, including consumables, instruments, and services.  We expect our revenue to continue to increase in 2015.

•

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue (gross margin) increased to

69.7%

in


from

64.2%

in


.  We settled our litigation with Syntrix in 2014, which resulted in a reversal of cost of sales of $10.4 million during the year, which positively impacted our gross margin.  See detailed discussions on this matter in note “10. Legal Proceedings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  In addition, higher margins on sequencing instrument sales during the period and efficiencies in manufacturing contributed to the increase in gross margin.  Gross margin in 2013 was negatively affected by a $25.2 million impairment charge associated with the discontinuation of the Eco and NuPCR product lines.  We believe our gross margin in future periods will depend on several factors, including: market conditions that may impact our pricing power; sales mix changes among consumables, instruments, and services; product mix changes between established products and new products in new markets; our cost structure for manufacturing operations; royalties; and our ability to create innovative and high premium products that meet or stimulate customer demand.



•

Income from operations

increased

by

$380.6 million

in


compared to


.  Operating expenses in 2014 included a

$82.1 million

legal contingency gain associated with the Syntrix patent litigation matter, as compared to a $115.4 million legal contingency charge in 2013 associated with the matter.  Operating expenses in 2014 also included a $48.8 million research and development charge recorded upon our litigation settlement and pooling of patents with Sequenom, Inc.  These changes as well as higher gross profit in 2014 led to the increase in income from operations despite the increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, which we expect will continue to grow.

•

Our effective tax rate was

21.3%

in


and


.  The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% in


and


was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as earnings in Singapore and the United Kingdom, and the benefit from research and development credits and foreign tax credits.  Our future effective tax rate may vary from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor “We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions” in Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.  We anticipate that our effective tax rate will trend lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in the future due to the portion of our earnings that will be subject to lower statutory tax rates.

•

We ended


with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling

$1.3 billion

This overview and outlook provides a high-level discussion of our operating results and significant known trends that affect our business.  We believe that an understanding of these trends is important to understanding our financial results for the periods reported herein as well as our future financial performance.  This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Results of Operations

To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth audited consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

December 30, 2012

stated as a percentage of total revenue.

Our fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.  Each of fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 52 weeks.

Revenue



Product revenue consists primarily of revenue from sales of consumables and instruments.  Services and other revenue consists primarily of sequencing and genotyping service revenue as well as instrument service contract revenue.  Revenues from businesses acquired in 2013 are predominantly recorded in service and other revenue.


Compared to


Consumables revenue

increased

$160.7 million

, or

18%

, to

$1,041.0 million

in


compared to

$880.3 million

in the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to sales of sequencing consumables, driven by the growth in the installed base, including HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq platforms introduced in January 2014.  Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in array consumables.

Instrument revenue

increased

$190.7 million

, or

51%

, to

$562.2 million

in


compared to

$371.5 million

in the prior year, driven primarily by shipments of sequencing instruments, in particular HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq platforms introduced in January 2014.

Service and other revenue

increased

$85.3 million

, or

55%

, to

$241.8 million

in


compared to

$156.5 million

in the prior year, driven primarily by sequencing services and extended service contracts for our instruments as our installed base continues to grow.  Revenues from businesses acquired in 2013 are predominantly recorded in service revenue.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013, the increase in service and other revenue was 35%.


Compared to


Consumables revenue

increased

$151.0 million

, or

21%

, to

$880.3 million

in


compared to

$729.3 million

in the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of sequencing consumables, driven by the growth in the installed base for both HiSeq and MiSeq systems, as well as higher consumable sales per HiSeq instrument in the installed base.

Instrument revenue

increased

$57.2 million

, or

18%

, to

$371.5 million

in


compared to

$314.3 million

in the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in HiSeq shipments.

The increase in service and other revenue in


compared to prior year was driven by an increase in sequencing service volume and instrument service contract revenue as a result of our growing installed base.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions completed in 2013, the increase in service and other revenue was 49%.

Gross Margin


Compared to


Gross profit

increased

$385.8 million

, or

42%

, to

$1,297.7 million

in


compared to

$911.9 million

in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue.  Excluding gross profit from acquisitions completed in 2013, which was predominately included in gross profit from service sales, the increase in gross profit was 37%.  Also contributing to the increase in gross profit was our litigation settlement with Syntrix in 2014, which resulted in reversal of cost of sales of $10.4 million.  See detailed discussions on this matter in note “10. Legal Proceedings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  In addition, higher margins on sequencing instrument sales and efficiencies in manufacturing contributed to the increase in gross margin.  In 2013, gross margin was negatively affected by a $25.2 million impairment charge associated with the discontinuation of the Eco and NuPCR product lines.


Compared to


Gross profit

increased

$138.4 million

, or

18%

, to

$911.9 million

compared to

$773.5 million

in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenue.  Excluding gross profit from acquisitions completed in 2013, which was predominately included in gross profit from services sales, the increase in gross profit was 19%.  Gross margin decreased in 2013 in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to impairments associated with the discontinuation of the Eco and NuPCR product lines, an increase in



amortization of acquired intangible assets due to recent acquisitions, and an increase in legal contingencies, which had an aggregate impact to gross margins of 3.9%. Acquisitions also contributed to the decrease in gross margin. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impacts from higher instrument margins, higher mix of sequencing consumables, and operational efficiencies.

Operating Expense


Compared to


Research and development expense

increased

by

$111.3 million

, or

40%

, in


from


. The increase is partially attributable to our litigation settlement and patent pooling agreement with Sequenom in 2014, as $48.8 million was recorded to research and development expense for the upfront payment.  See detailed discussion on this matter in note “10. Legal Proceedings” to our financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  In addition, headcount increases and other expenses related to our new product launches contributed to the increase in research and development expenses, reflecting our continued investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products.

Selling, general and administrative expense

increased

by

$85.2 million

, or

22%

in


from


.  The increase is primarily driven by increases in headcount, consulting services, and infrastructure investment to support the growth of our Company.

Acquisitions completed in 2013 also contributed to the increases in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense in 2014 compared to 2013.

Legal contingencies in


reflected predominantly the

$82.1 million

gain from our litigation settlement with Syntrix, offset by other legal contingency charges. The

$115.4 million

in legal contingencies in 2013 were primarily charges recorded for the Syntrix litigation matter.  See detailed discussion on this matter in note “10. Legal Proceedings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We completed the relocation of our headquarters in 2012.  During


and 2013, we incurred

$5.6 million

and

$2.6 million

, respectively, in additional headquarter relocation expense, consisting primarily of changes in estimated lease exit liability recorded upon vacating our former headquarters, and accretion expense related to such facility exit obligation.

Acquisition related (gain) expense, net, in


and 2013 consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration and transaction related costs.

In 2013, we recorded

$13.6 million

of expenses incurred in relation to an unsolicited tender offer in Q1 2012.  The expenses consisted primarily of advisory and legal fees.  The advisory service arrangement was completed in 2013.


Compared to


Research and development expense increased by

$45.7 million

, or

20%

, in


from


, primarily due to increased headcount and consulting services as we continued to increase our investment in the development of new products as well as enhancements to existing products.  In 2012, we recorded a $21.4 million impairment charge for an in-process research and development asset.  The lack of such charge in 2013 partially offset the increase in overall research and development expense.



Selling, general and administrative expense increased by

$95.0 million

, or

33%

, in


from


.  The increase is primarily driven by increased headcount and consulting services to support the growth of our Company and our focus on global business process improvements, as well as increased amortization of intangible assets.

Acquisitions completed in 2013 and 2012 also contributed to the increases in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense.

During 2013, we recorded $115.4 million in legal contingency charges within operating expenses primarily related to the Syntrix litigation matter.  See detailed discussion on this matter in note “10. Legal Proceedings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We completed the relocation of our headquarters in 2012.  During 2013, we recorded additional cease-use losses due to a delay in the sublease of portions of our prior headquarters and accretion of interest expense related to the facility exit obligation recorded upon vacating our former headquarters.  Headquarter relocation expense recorded in 2012 consisted of cease-use loss recorded upon vacating our prior headquarters, accretion expense related to the facility exit obligation, double rent expense during the transition to our new facility, and moving expenses.

Acquisition related (gain) expense, net

, in 2013 consisted primarily of gains from changes in fair value of contingent consideration of $18.8 million.  Such gains were partially offset by transaction and other acquisition related costs of $7.2 million.  Acquisition related (gain) expense, net in 2012 consisted of changes in fair value of contingent consideration of $2.0 million.

During 2013, we recorded $13.6 million of expenses incurred in relation to an unsolicited tender offer in Q1 2012.  The expenses consisted primarily of advisory and legal fees.  The advisory related expenses decreased from the prior year as the advisory service arrangements were completed.

As a result of a restructuring effort announced in 2011, we recorded restructuring charges of $3.5 million during 2012, comprised primarily of severance pay and other employee separation costs.

Other (Expense) Income, Net


Compared to


Interest income primarily consisted of returns from our investment portfolio.  Interest income

decreased

slightly in


compared to


as a result of lower yields, partially offset by the impact from a larger investment portfolio.  Interest expense in


remained relatively consistent to


and consisted primarily of accretion on our convertible senior notes.

Cost-method investment related gain, net

in


consisted of a gain associated with additional proceeds received for a cost-method investment sold in a prior year.  In 2013, we recognized $61.4 million in gains from sales of cost-method investments, of which $55.2 million related to the sale of our minority ownership interest in Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.

Other expense, net

, in


and


primarily consisted of loss on extinguishment of debt and net foreign exchange gains and losses.  In conjunction with the issuance of the 2019 and 2021 Notes, we used $1,244.7 million in cash to repurchase $600.0 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2016 Notes in privately negotiated transactions.  As a result, we recorded $31.4 million in loss on extinguishment of debt calculated as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liability component of the debt.




Compared to


Interest income decreased in 2013 from 2012 as a result of a decrease in our investment portfolio balance as well as lower yields during the period.  Furthermore, interest income in 2012 included a $6.0 million recovery of a note receivable.  Interest expense in 2013 remained relatively consistent as compared to 2012 and consisted primarily of accretion of discount on our convertible senior notes.

In 2013, we recognized $61.4 million in gains from sales of cost-method investments, of which $55.2 million related to the sale of our minority ownership interest in Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.  Cost-method investment related gain in 2012 consisted of a gain of $48.6 million on the sale of our minority ownership interest in deCODE Genetics, partially offset by an impairment loss of $2.7 million on another cost-method investment that was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Other expense, net

in 2013 and 2012 primarily consisted of net foreign exchange losses and losses on the extinguishment of debt recorded on conversions of our 2014 Notes.

Provision for Income Taxes


Compared to


Our effective tax rate was

21.3%

in


and 2013, respectively.  The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as earnings in Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, the variance in 2014 was also attributable to the benefit from research and development credits and foreign tax credits, and the variance in 2013 was also attributable to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in January 2013. These items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the U.S.


Compared to


Our effective tax rate was

21.3%

in


, as compared to

32.1%

in 2012.  The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% in 2013 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, such as earnings in Singapore and the United Kingdom; and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for 2012 which was enacted in January 2013.  These items offset the impact of recording a valuation allowance which was primarily related to the estimated limitation on utilizing foreign tax credits in the U.S.  In 2012 the variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory rates.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law on January 2, 2013, included the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013.  Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 30, 2012 did not include the impact of the federal research credit generated in 2012 since the law was enacted subsequent to our 2012 reporting period.  Instead, the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit generated in 2012 reduced our provision for income taxes for 2013 by approximately $2.9 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At

December 28, 2014

, we had approximately

$636.2 million

in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately

$430 million

were held by our foreign subsidiaries.  Cash and cash equivalents decreased by

$75.5 million

from last year, due to the



factors described in the “Cash Flow Summary” below.  Our primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, has been cash flows from operations.  Our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating, investing, and financing needs.  It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries.

Historically, we have liquidated our short-term investments and/or issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities.  As of

December 28, 2014

, we have

$702.2 million

in short-term investments.  Short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries as of

December 28, 2014

, were approximately

$260 million

.  Our short-term investments include marketable securities consisting of U.S government-sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.

In June 2014, we issued convertible senior notes due 2019 and 2021 (2019 and 2021 Notes) with an aggregate principal amount of $1,150.0 million.  The proceeds from such issuance and cash on hand totaling

$1,244.7 million

were used to repurchase $600.0 million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2016 (2016 Notes).  As of

December 28, 2014

,

$320.0 million

in principal amount of the 2016 Notes remained outstanding, with a maturity date of March 15, 2016.  The 2016 Notes became convertible on April 1, 2014 and continue to be convertible through March 31, 2015.  It is our intent and policy to settle conversions of the 2016 Notes through combination settlement, which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the principal amount and delivery of the excess of conversion value over the principal amount in shares of common stock.  The 2019 and 2021 Notes were not convertible as of

December 28, 2014

.

We anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with cash provided by operating activities are sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next 12 months.  Operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures.  Our primary short-term needs for capital, which are subject to change, include:

•

potential early repayment of debt obligations as a result of conversions;

•

support of commercialization efforts related to our current and future products, including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources both in the United States and abroad;

•

acquisitions of equipment and other fixed assets for use in our current and future manufacturing and research and development facilities;

•

repurchases of our outstanding common stock;

•

the continued advancement of research and development efforts;

•

potential strategic acquisitions and investments;

•

the expansion needs of our facilities, including costs of leasing additional facilities; and

•

investment in our global business processes, and the associated Enterprise Resource Planning platform.

As of

December 28, 2014

, we had

$44.1 million

in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with prior acquisitions to be settled in future periods.

During 2014, we used

$237.2 million

to repurchase our outstanding shares under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.  As of

December 28, 2014

, there remains

$130.4 million

under the authorized programs.

We expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income, as well as the status of each of our new product development programs, will significantly impact our cash management decisions.

Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including:

•

our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets;

•

scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs;

•

competing technological and market developments; and

•

the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  During the fiscal year ended

December 28, 2014

, we were not involved in any “off-balance sheet arrangements” within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Contractual Obligations

Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding.  The following table represents our contractual obligations as of

December 28, 2014

, aggregated by type (amounts in thousands):

_______________________________________

(1)

The table excludes

$123.0 million

of contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions and

$52.1 million

of uncertain tax positions.  These items were excluded because it remained uncertain as of

December 28, 2014

with respect to the timing and amounts of the settlement of such contingent payments or uncertain positions, if any.  See notes “3. Acquisitions” and “11. Income Taxes”, respectively, in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussions of these items.

(2)

Debt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2016, 2019, and 2021, as well as interest payments to be made under the notes.  Although these notes mature in 2016, 2019, and 2021, respectively, they may be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met.  Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as



indicated in the table.  See note “6. Convertible Senior Notes” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes.

(3)

Contractual obligations under leases excludes the lease we signed on December 30, 2014 for a facility in Foster City, California, which will commence in 2017.  The aggregate rent during the initial term of the lease is expected to be approximately

$204.0 million

. See note “7. Commitments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of this lease.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience, market and other conditions, and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, the estimation process is, by its nature, uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control.  If market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.  In addition, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments.  In addition, had we used estimates different from any of these, our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented.  Members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates, and our disclosure regarding them, with the audit committee of our board of directors.  Our accounting policies are more fully described in note “1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services.  Product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis.  Service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts.  The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations.  Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgment and estimates.

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  In instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met.  We occasionally offer discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers of existing products.  These promotions sometimes involve the trade-in of existing products in exchange for a discount on new products.  Where applicable, we defer a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products.  All revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities.

Revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer, provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured.  Revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered, typically evenly over the contract term.  Revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable, we evaluate whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price, deliverables, or other terms.  If it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable, we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable.  We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with, and the creditworthiness of, the customer.  If we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment.

We regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services.  These products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame, approximately three to six months, after the contract execution date.  Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of



accounting determined to exist in the contract.  A delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.  Items are considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand-alone basis.

For transactions with multiple deliverables, consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price.  The relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party evidence of selling price if VSOE does not exist.  If neither VSOE nor third-party evidence exists, we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range.  VSOE of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range.  If there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and VSOE of selling price cannot be determined, then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price.  Due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry, we have rarely established selling price using third-party evidence.  If neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists, we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling 12-month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions.  If the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient, we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts.  We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

In certain markets, we sell products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products.  In most sales through distributors, the product is delivered directly to customers.  In cases where the product is delivered to a distributor, revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor, and/or the end-user, if required by the applicable sales contract.  The terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers.  These transactions are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy described herein.

Investments

We invest in various types of securities, including debt securities in government-sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.  As of

December 28, 2014

, we had

$702.2 million

in short-term investments.  In accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements, we classify our investments as Level 1, 2, or 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access.  Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.  Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset.

As discussed in note “5. Fair Value Measurements” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, a majority of our security holdings have been classified as Level 2.  These securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly, such as yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.  We perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings, and in the process, we apply judgment and estimates that if changed, could significantly affect our statement of financial positions.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.  We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  We regularly analyze customer accounts, review the length of time receivables are outstanding, review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future.  Our gross trade accounts receivables totaled

$294.9 million

and the allowance for doubtful accounts was

$5.5 million

at

December 28, 2014

.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses.  However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate.



Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market.  We record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete, or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value.  We must make assumptions about future demand, market conditions, and the release of new products that will supersede old ones.  We regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components, taking into account product life cycles, quality issues, historical experience, and usage forecasts.  Our gross inventory totaled

$217.2 million

and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was

$26.1 million

at

December 28, 2014

.  Historically, our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses.  However, if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated, additional inventory adjustments could be required.

Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, employment, and contractual matters.  In connection with these matters, we assess, on a regular basis, the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters.  A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.  We regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors, which include, but are not limited to, past history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter.  We may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates, resulting in a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.

Business Combinations

Under the acquisition method of accounting, we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition.  The fair values assigned, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants, are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management.  We record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, as goodwill.  These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

In connection with certain of our acquisitions, additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones.  In these cases, a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows, risk-free adjusted discount rates, and nonperformance risk.  Any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related (gain) expense, net, a component of operating expenses, in our consolidated statements of income.  This method requires significant management judgment, including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates.  Future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains.

Management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets.  This method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors.  The estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages.  If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges.  In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.  If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets — Impairment Assessments

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired.  A review of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment.  If indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts.



In order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets.  The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows, the time value of money, and other factors that a willing market participant would consider.  Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows.

Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective.  They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.  For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit, we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets.  Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.

Share-Based Compensation

We are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payments based on estimated fair value.  We estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model.  The fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant.

The determination of fair value of share-based awards using the BSM model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income.  These include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price, expected life of an award, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate, and forecast of our future financial performance, in the case of performance stock units.  We determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock.  The historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards, adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur, and other relevant factors.  Implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange-traded call options on our common stock.  The expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience, exercise activity, and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards.  We determined expected dividend yield to be 0% given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends.  The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share-based awards.  We update our forecast of future financial performance periodically, which impacts our estimate of the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the outstanding performance stock units.  We amortize the fair value of share-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.  If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, share-based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period.

Warranties

We generally provide a one-year warranty on instruments.  Additionally, we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date, which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date.  We establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance.  We periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve, and adjust, if necessary, the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred.  If our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense.

Cease-Use Loss upon Exit of Facility

We may, from time to time, relocate or consolidate our office locations and cease to use a facility for which the lease continues beyond the cease-use date.  We estimate cease-use loss as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period, adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements.  In this process, management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease, including the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts, and the risk-adjusted discount rate.  These assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates, resulting in significant adjustments to the cease-use loss recorded.



Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid.  Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the United States and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes.  Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and estimates ofour future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved.  In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence.  Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.  Based on the available evidence as of

December 28, 2014

, we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized.  Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance of

$15.2 million

against certain U.S. deferred tax assets.

We recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  Tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions.  Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability.  These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates.  The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates.  Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.  We attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk.  We mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities.  We have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments.  In addition, if a 100 basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in


, our interest income would change by approximately

$13.4 million

in relation to amounts we would expect to earn, based on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of

December 28, 2014

.

Changes in interest rates may impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes.  In June 2014, we issued

$632.5 million

aggregate principal amount of

0%

convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and

$517.5 million

aggregate principal amount of

0.5%

convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes).  Similar to our 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2016, at our election, the notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock under certain circumstances, including trading price conditions related to our common stock.  If the trading price of our common stock reaches a price at 130% above the conversion price, the notes will become convertible.  Upon conversion, we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value.  The fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then-current incremental borrowing rate.  If our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes, we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted.  The implicit interest rates for the 2019 and 2021 Notes were

2.9%

and

3.5%

, respectively.  An incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical 100 basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of



$100.0 million aggregate principal amount of each of the 2019 and 2021 Notes would result in losses of approximately

$4.1 million

and

$5.5 million

, respectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company’s U.S. dollar functional currency.  These transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  The value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash.  Our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the Euro, Yen, and Australian dollar.  Both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income.  We recorded a

$5.4 million

net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended

December 28, 2014

on business transactions, excluding hedging transactions, which are included in other (expense) income, net, in our consolidated statements of income.

We use forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  We only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks; we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  We primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, and they generally have terms of one month or less.  Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income, as they have not been designated for hedge accounting.  These contracts, which settle monthly, effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled, so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the gains or losses from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.  As of

December 28, 2014

, the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was

$61.0 million

.

1.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Business

Illumina, Inc. is a provider of sequencing- and array-based solutions, which serves customers in a board range of markets, enabling the adoption of genomic solutions in research and clinical settings.  The Company’s customers include leading genomic research centers, academic institutions, government laboratories, hospitals, and reference laboratories, as well as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agrigenomics, commercial molecular diagnostic, and consumer genomics companies.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.  Each of the years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

December 30, 2012

were


weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

.  The new standard is based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and allows for a full retrospective or a modified retrospective adoption approach.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.

Segment Information

Effective December 30, 2013, the Company reorganized and separated the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and the President, with core market and operational functions centralized and reporting to the President, for the primary purpose of achieving scalability in business operations to support the growth in the Company’s strategic markets.  Corporate functions and the President report to the CEO.  As a result, the Company operates under

one

operating segment and reports under

one

reportable segment.

Concentrations of Risk

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing.  Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities, and other factors could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.  A portion of the Company’s customers consist of university and research institutions that management believes are, to some degree, directly or indirectly supported by the United States Government.  A significant change in current research funding, particularly with respect to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s future revenues and results of operations.



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company is also subject to risks related to its financial instruments including its cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable.  Most of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of

December 28, 2014

were deposited with U.S. financial institutions, either domestically or with their foreign branches.  The Company’s investment policy restricts the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to

5%

of the portfolio or

5%

of the total issue size outstanding at the time of purchase and to any one industry sector, as defined by Bloomberg classifications, to

30%

of the portfolio at the time of purchase.  There is no limit to the percentage of the portfolio that may be maintained in debt securities in U.S. government-sponsored entities, U.S. Treasury securities, and money market funds.

The Company’s products require customized products and components that currently are available from a limited number of sources.  The Company sources certain key products and components included in its products from single vendors.

The Company performs a regular review of customer activity and associated credit risks and does not require collateral or enter into netting arrangements.  Shipments to customers outside the United States comprised

49%

,

50%

, and

51%

of the Company’s revenue for the years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

December 30, 2012

, respectively.  Customers outside the United States represented

48%

and

52%

of the Company’s gross trade accounts receivable balance as of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, respectively.

International sales entail a variety of risks, including currency exchange fluctuations, longer payment cycles, and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection.  The Company is also subject to general geopolitical risks, such as political, social and economic instability, and changes in diplomatic and trade relations.  The risks of international sales are mitigated in part by the extent to which sales are geographically distributed.  The Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses from investments and accounts receivable.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The Company uses a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 —

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 —

Inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3 —

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The carrying amounts of financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, excluding acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities, approximate the related fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Functional Currency

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company’s international operations.  The Company remeasures its foreign subsidiaries’ monetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income.

Acquisitions

The Company measures all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies, at fair value as of the acquisition date.  Contingent purchase considerations to be settled in cash are remeasured to estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in acquisition related (gain) expense, net, a component of operating expenses.  In addition, the Company capitalizes in-process research and development (IPR&D) and either amortizes it over the life of the product upon commercialization, or impairs it if the project is abandoned.



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Post-acquisition adjustments in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded in current period income tax expense.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash equivalents are comprised of short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.

Short-term investments consist predominantly of debt securities in U.S. government-sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.  Management classifies short-term investments as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date.  All short-term investments are recorded at estimated fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity.  The Company evaluates its investments to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired.  Impairments are considered to be other than temporary if they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely that the Company will sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis.  Realized gains, losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income.

Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net invoice value and are not interest bearing.  The Company considers receivables past due based on the contractual payment terms.  The Company reserves specific receivables if collectibility is no longer reasonably assured.  The Company also reserves a percentage of its trade receivable balance based on collection history and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses.  The Company re-evaluates such reserves on a regular basis and adjusts its reserves as needed.  Once a receivable is deemed to be uncollectible, such balance is charged against the reserve.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first in, first out basis.  Inventory includes raw materials and finished goods that may be used in the research and development process and such items are expensed as consumed or expired.  Provisions for slow moving, excess, and obsolete inventories are estimated based on product life cycles, quality issues, historical experience, and usage forecasts.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from

three

to

seven years

, using the straight-line method.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  When assets are sold, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operating expense.

In 2013, as a part of the Company’s ongoing effort to upgrade its current information systems, the Company started the implementation of new enterprise resource planning software and applications to manage parts of its business operations.  Certain costs incurred in the development of such internal-use software and software applications, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable compensation costs of employees devoted to specific software development, are capitalized as computer software costs.  Costs incurred outside of the application development stage are expensed as incurred.

Leases

Leases are reviewed and classified as capital or operating at their inception.  The Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which includes the construction build-out period and lease extension periods, if appropriate.  The difference between rent payments and straight-line rent expense is recorded as deferred rent in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities.  Landlord allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense.  The Company capitalizes leasehold improvements and amortizes the value over the shorter of the lease term or expected useful lives.



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Headquarter relocation expenses consisted of expenses such as accelerated depreciation expense, impairment of assets, additional rent expense during the transition period in 2012 when both the new and former headquarter facilities were occupied, moving expenses, cease-use losses, and accretion of interest expense on lease exit liability.  The Company completed the relocation of its headquarters in 2012 to another facility in San Diego, California and recorded cease-use losses and the corresponding facility exit obligation upon vacating its former headquarters in 2011 and 2012, calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period, adjusted for deferred items and estimated lease incentives.  The Company reassesses the facility exit obligation on a quarterly basis and the key assumptions used in the calculation include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts, and the risk-adjusted discount rate.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired.  The change in the carrying value of goodwill during the year ended

December 28, 2014

was due to a current year acquisition and adjustments to the purchase price subsequent to the preliminary allocation of purchase price related to prior year acquisitions.  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment.  During its goodwill impairment review, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.  The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the overall financial performance of the Company.  If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then no additional assessment is deemed necessary.  Otherwise, the Company proceeds to perform the two-step test for goodwill impairment.  The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of loss, which involves comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill.  The Company may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and elect to proceed to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test.  The Company performed its annual assessment for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of


, noting

no

impairment.

The Company’s identifiable intangible assets are typically comprised of acquired core technologies, licensed technologies, customer relationships, license agreements, and trade names.  The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives.

The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate its intangible assets with finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are potentially impaired.  If indicators of impairment exist, the Company performs an impairment test to assess the recoverability of the affected assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows.  If the affected assets are not recoverable, the Company estimates the fair value of the assets and records an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.  Factors that may indicate potential impairment include a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization compared to its net book value, significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate positive cash flows the Company’s strategic business objectives, and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset.

During 2013, the Company decided to discontinue its Eco and NuPCR product lines to better align its product portfolio with its core strategy.  As a result, the Company recorded a total impairment charge of

$25.2 million

in cost of product revenue,

$22.9 million

of which related to identifiable intangible assets.

Derivatives

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of business.  The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risks related to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value in other assets or other liabilities and are not designated as hedging instruments.  Changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in other expense, net, along with the remeasurement gain or loss on the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.

As of

December 28, 2014

, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts in place to hedge exposures in the euro, Japanese yen, and Australian dollar.  As of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was

$61.0 million

and

$54.7 million

, respectively.  Non-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

designated foreign exchange forward contract related gain was

$4.1 million

and

$3.5 million

for the years ended

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, respectively, and immaterial for the year ended

December 30, 2012

.

Reserve for Product Warranties

The Company generally provides a

one

-year warranty on instruments.  Additionally, the Company provides a warranty on consumables through the expiration date, which generally ranges from

six

to

twelve

months after the manufacture date.  At the time revenue is recognized, the Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance.  The Company periodically reviews its warranty reserve for adequacy and adjusts the warranty accrual, if necessary, based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred.  Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of product revenue.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services.  Product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis.  Service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from genotyping and sequencing services and instrument service contracts.

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.  In instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required, revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met.  The Company occasionally offers discounts on newly introduced products to recent customers or existing products. These promotions sometimes involve the trade-in of existing products in exchange for a discount on new products.  Where applicable, the Company defers a portion of revenue on the sales of existing products in recognition of the promotional discounts until the delivery of new products.  All revenue is recorded net of discounts and sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities.

Revenue from product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer, provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured.  Revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered, typically evenly over the contract term.  Revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned, which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached.

In order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable, the Company evaluates whether an arrangement is cancellable or subject to future changes in price, deliverables, or other terms.  If it is determined that the price is not fixed or determinable, the Company defers revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable.  The Company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with, and the creditworthiness of, the customer.  If the Company determines that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured, revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment.

The Company regularly enters into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including products or services.  These products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame, approximately

three

to

six

months, after the contract execution date.  Revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract.  A delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis.  Items are considered to have stand-alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand-alone basis.

For transactions with multiple deliverables, consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price.  The relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party evidence of selling price if VSOE does not exist.  If neither VSOE nor third-party evidence exists, the Company uses its best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable.

In order to establish VSOE of selling price, the Company must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range.  VSOE of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range.  If there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and VSOE of selling price cannot be determined, then the Company considers whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price.  Due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry, the Company has rarely established selling price using third-party evidence.  If



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

neither VSOE nor third party evidence of selling price exists, the Company determines its best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling


-month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions.  If the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient, the Company relies upon prices set by the Company’s pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts.  The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when it determines there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance.

In certain markets, the Company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products.  In most sales through distributors, the product is delivered directly to customers.  In cases where the product is delivered to a distributor, revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor, and/or the end-user, if required by the applicable sales contract.  The terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers.  These transactions are accounted for in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy described herein.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company incurs share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, its Employee Stock purchase Plan (ESPP), and stock options.

Restricted stock units (RSU), restricted stock awards (RSA), and performance stock units (PSU) are all considered restricted stock.  The fair value of restricted stock is determined by the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, taking into consideration estimated forfeitures.  PSU represents a right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based on the achievement of corporate performance goals and continued employment during the vesting period.  At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of the achievement of such corporate performance goals and any additional expenses resulting from an adjustment in the estimated shares to be released are treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of adjustment.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock purchases under ESPP and stock options granted.  The model assumptions include expected volatility, term, dividends, and the risk-free interest rate.  The Company determines the expected volatility by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock.  The historical volatility is generally commensurate with the estimated expected term of the Company’s stock awards, adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations and other relevant factors.  The implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange-traded call options on the Company’s common stock.  The expected term of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience, exercise activity, and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards.  The expected dividend yield is determined to be

0%

given that the Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying such cash dividends.  The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share-based awards.

Shipping and Handling Expenses

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product revenue.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses include personnel expenses, contractor fees, license fees, facilities costs, and utilities.  Expenditures relating to research and development are expensed in the period incurred.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income.  A valuation allowance is established when the Company believes it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved.  In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence.  Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, history of earnings and reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.

The Company recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.  When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows the with-and-without approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions.  Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the Company.

The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense.

Net Income per Share

Basic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.

Potentially dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable under convertible senior notes, equity awards, and warrants. Convertible senior notes have a dilutive impact when the average market price of the Company’s common stock exceeds the applicable conversion price of the respective notes.  Potentially dilutive common shares from equity awards and warrants are determined using the average share price for each period under the treasury stock method.  In addition, the following amounts are assumed to be used to repurchase shares: proceeds from exercise of equity awards and warrants; the average amount of unrecognized compensation expense for equity awards; and estimated tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when expenses related to equity awards become deductible.  In loss periods, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share are identical because the otherwise dilutive potential common shares become anti-dilutive and are therefore excluded.

Acquisitions

Acquisitions in 2013

On February 21, 2013, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Verinata Health, Inc., a provider of non-invasive tests for the early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities.  With this acquisition, the Company strengthened its reproductive health product portfolio by gaining access to Verinata’s verifi non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) as well as what management believes to be the most comprehensive intellectual property portfolio in the NIPT industry.

The contractual price for the acquisition was

$350.0 million

, plus potential cash payments of up to

$100.0 million

based on the achievement of certain regulatory and revenue milestones.  The aggregate purchase price was determined to be

$396.3 million

, including total cash payment of

$339.3 million

,

$56.2 million

in fair value of the contingent milestone payments,

$0.2 million

in fair value of converted stock options attributed to pre-combination services, and

$0.5 million

in loss realized on settlement of preexisting relationships.  In connection with the transaction, the Company deposited into escrow

$30.0 million

of consideration otherwise payable to shareholders of Verinata.  This amount was included in the aggregate consideration and was released to shareholders of Verinata in September of 2014.  As of

December 29, 2013

, transaction costs of

$3.4 million

were expensed as incurred in acquisition related (gain) expense, net.

In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company assumed the Verinata Health, Inc. 2008 Stock Plan and converted, as of the acquisition date, the unvested stock options outstanding under the plan, all of which were in the money, into

0.4 million

unvested stock options to purchase Illumina’s common stock, retaining the original vesting schedules.  The fair value of all converted options was

$18.9 million

,

$0.2 million

of which was attributed to the pre-combination service period and was included in the calculation of purchase price.  The remaining fair value is being recognized over the awards’ remaining vesting periods subsequent to the acquisition.  The weighted-average acquisition-date fair value of the converted options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: (i) market price of

$48.36

per share, which was the closing price of Illumina’s common stock on the acquisition date; (ii) weighted average expected term of

2.3 years

; (iii) weighted average risk-free interest rate of

0.32%

; (iv) weighted average annualized volatility of

42%

; and (v)

no

dividend yield.  The weighted average acquisition-date fair value per share of the assumed stock options was

$42.63

.

An initial liability of

$56.2 million

was recorded for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration.  Any change in the fair value of the contingent milestone consideration subsequent to the acquisition date was and will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income.  The fair value of the regulatory milestone payments was measured by the probability-weighted discounted cash flows and the fair value of the revenue milestone payments was measured using a risk-neutral option pricing model, which captures the present value of the expected payment and the probability of reaching the revenue targets.  Key assumptions used in the fair value assessments included discount rates ranging from

6%

to

20%

, volatility of

50%

, risk-free rates of

0.26%

, revenue projections, and the probability of achieving regulatory milestones.  This fair value measurement of the contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement.  Level 3 instruments are valued based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company’s own assumptions in measuring fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of

December 29, 2013

, the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date was as follows (in thousands):

In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company assumed Verinata’s building lease, for which Verinata was considered the accounting owner of the leased building and as such, recorded the fair value of the building as an asset as of the acquisition date.  The building is depreciated over a useful life of

30 years

.  The Company also recorded the related lease financing obligation as a liability assumed, representing the present value of all remaining building lease payments with an interest rate of

6.0%

.  The annual future minimum payments, including the balloon payment at the end of the lease for the value of the building to be transferred to the landlord, are

$1.0 million

for each of the years 2015 and 2016, and

$8.4 million

for 2017.

The following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired (amounts in thousands):

The fair value of the developed technology and trade name was estimated using an income approach.  Under the income approach, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset.  The estimated fair value was developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return.  The fair value of the customer relationships was developed using a cost approach by estimating the time and personnel effort in constructing the customer base.  The useful life of the intangible assets for amortization purposes was determined by considering the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets adjusted as appropriate for the entity-specific factors including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that may limit the useful life of intangible assets.

The excess of the fair value of the total consideration over the estimated fair value of the net assets was recorded as goodwill, which was primarily attributable to the synergies expected from combining the technologies of Illumina with those of Verinata, including complementary products that will enhance the Company’s overall product portfolio, and the value of the workforce that became our employees following the closing of the acquisitions.  The goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes.

Acquisition in 2012

On September 19, 2012, the Company announced the acquisition of BlueGnome Ltd. (BlueGnome), a provider of cytogenetics and in vitro fertilization screening products.  Total consideration for the acquisition was

$95.5 million

, which included

$88.0 million

in initial cash payments and

$7.5 million

in fair value of contingent cash consideration of up to

$20.0 million

based on the achievement of certain revenue based milestones by December 28, 2014.

The Company estimated the fair value of contingent cash consideration using a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach, a Level 3 measurement, using a discount rate of

30%

.  The Company also agreed to pay up to

$20.0 million

to BlueGnome shareholders contingent upon the retention of certain key employees and certain other criteria.  Such contingent payments are recognized as contingent compensation expense over the retention period through December 28, 2014.

As a result of this acquisition, the Company recorded developed technologies of

$25.0 million

, customer relationships of

$16.8 million

, and a trade name of

$7.1 million

with average useful lives of

seven

,

Fair Value Measurements

The following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

(in thousands):

The Company holds available-for-sale securities that consist of highly liquid, investment grade debt securities.  The Company considers information provided by the Company’s investment accounting and reporting service provider in the measurement of fair value of its debt securities.  The investment service provider provides valuation information from an industry-recognized valuation service.  Such valuations may be based on trade prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) or valuation models using inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs), such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, yield curve, volatility factors, credit spreads, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt, broker and dealer quotes, as well as other relevant economic measures.  The Company’s deferred compensation plan assets consist primarily of investments in life insurance contracts carried at cash surrender value, which reflects the net asset value of the underlying publicly traded mutual funds.  The Company performs control procedures to corroborate the fair value of its holdings, including comparing valuations obtained from its investment service provider to valuations reported by the Company’s asset custodians, validation of pricing sources and models, and review of key model inputs if necessary.

The Company reassesses the fair value of contingent consideration to be settled in cash related to acquisitions on a quarterly basis using the income approach.  This is a Level 3 measurement.  Significant assumptions used in the measurement include probabilities of achieving the remaining milestones and the discount rates, which depend on the milestone risk profiles.  The changes in fair value of the contingent considerations during the years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

On June 11, 2014, the Company issued

$632.5 million

aggregate principal amount of

0%

convertible senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and

$517.5 million

aggregate principal amount of

0.5%

convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in an offering conducted in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The Notes were issued at

100%

of par value.  The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting the offering expenses payable by the Company, was

$1,132.4 million

.  The Company used the net proceeds plus cash on hand to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2016 Notes in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance of the 2019 and 2021 Notes.

Both the 2019 and 2021 Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company's election, based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of

3.9318 shares

per

$1,000

principal amount of the notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately

$254.34

per share), only in the following circumstances and to the following extent:

(1) during the five business-day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per 2019 and 2021 Note for each day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter (and only during that quarter) after the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for 20 or more trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (3) upon the occurrence of specified events described in the indenture for the 2019 and 2021 Notes; and (4) at any time on or after March 15, 2019 for the 2019 Notes, or March 15, 2021 for the 2021 Notes, through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date

.

As noted in the indentures for the 2019 and 2021 Notes, it is the Company's intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the “principal portion” and delivery of the “share amount” in excess of the conversion value over the principal portion in shares of common stock.  In general, for each

$1,000

in principal the “principal portion” of cash upon settlement is defined as the lesser of

$1,000

and the conversion value during the


-day observation period.  The conversion value is the sum of the daily conversion value which is



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the product of the effective conversion rate divided by


days and the daily volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's common stock.  The “share amount” is the cumulative “daily share amount” during the observation period, which is calculated by dividing the daily VWAP into the difference between the daily conversion value (i.e., conversion rate x daily VWAP) and

$1,000

.

The 2019 Notes carry no coupon interest.  The Company pays

0.5%

interest per annum on the principal amount of the 2021 Notes, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2014.  The 2019 and 2021 Notes mature on

June 15, 2019

and

June 15, 2021

, respectively.  If a designated event, as defined in the indentures for the 2019 and 2021 Notes, such as acquisition, merger, or liquidation, occurs prior to the maturity date, subject to certain limitations, holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

The Company accounts separately for the liability and equity components of the 2019 and 2021 Notes in accordance with authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion.  The guidance requires the carrying amount of the liability component to be estimated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated conversion feature.  Because the Company has no outstanding non-convertible public debt, the Company determined that market-traded senior, unsecured corporate bonds represent a similar liability to the convertible senior notes without the conversion option.  Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry as the Company, and with similar maturities to the 2019 and 2021 Notes, the Company estimated the implied interest rates of its 2019 and 2021 Notes to be

2.9%

and

3.5%

, respectively, assuming no conversion option.  Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs.  The estimated implied interest rates were applied to the 2019 and 2021 Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component in aggregate of

$971.5 million

upon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the

$1,150.0 million

aggregate principal amount.  The

$161.2 million

difference between the cash proceeds of

$1,132.7 million

and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital as the 2019 and 2021 Notes are not considered redeemable.

As a policy election under applicable guidance related to the calculation of diluted net income per share, the Company elected the combination settlement method as its stated settlement policy and applied the treasury stock method in the calculation of the potential dilutive impact of the 2019 and 2021 Notes.  Neither the 2019 nor the 2021 Notes were convertible as of

December 28, 2014

and had no dilutive impact during the year ended

December 28, 2014

.  If the 2019 and 2021 Notes were converted as of

December 28, 2014

, the if-converted value would not exceed the principal amount.

0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016

In 2011, the Company issued

$920.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

0.25%

convertible senior notes due 2016 (2016 Notes) in an offering conducted in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The 2016 Notes were issued at

98.25%

of par value.  Debt issuance costs of approximately

$0.4 million

were primarily comprised of legal, accounting, and other professional fees, the majority of which were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized to interest expense over the

five

-year term of the 2016 Notes.

The 2016 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company’s election, based on an initial conversion rate, subject to adjustment, of

11.9687

shares per

$1,000

principal amount of the 2016 Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately

$83.55

per share), only in the following circumstances and to the following extent:

(1) during the five business-day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per 2016 Note for each day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; (2) during any calendar quarter (and only during that quarter) after the calendar quarter ending March 31, 2011, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for 20 or more trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (3) upon the occurrence of specified events described in the indenture for the 2016 Notes; and (4) at any time on or after December 15, 2015 through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

Based upon meeting the stock trading price conversion requirement during the three months ended March 30, 2014, the 2016 Notes became convertible on

April 1, 2014

and continue to be



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

convertible through

March 31, 2015

.  As such, the remaining 2016 Notes outstanding were classified as current liabilities as of

December 28, 2014

.

As noted in the indenture for the 2016 Notes, it is the Company’s intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves repayment of an amount of cash equal to the “principal portion” and delivery of the “share amount” in excess of the conversion value over the principal portion in shares of common stock.  In general, for each

$1,000

in principal, the “principal portion” of cash upon settlement is defined as the lesser of

$1,000

, and the conversion value during the


-day observation period as described in the indenture for the 2016 Notes.  The conversion value is the sum of the daily conversion value which is the product of the effective conversion rate divided by


days and the daily volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Company’s common stock.  The “share amount” is the cumulative “daily share amount” during the observation period, which is calculated by dividing the daily VWAP into the difference between the daily conversion value (i.e., conversion rate x daily VWAP) and

$1,000

.  The Company pays

0.25%

interest per annum on the principal amount of the 2016 Notes semiannually in arrears in cash on March 15 and September 15 of each year.  The 2016 Notes mature on

March 15, 2016

.  If a designated event, as defined in the indenture for the 2016 Notes, such as an acquisition, merger, or liquidation, occurs prior to the maturity date, subject to certain limitations, holders of the 2016 Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2016 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the 2016 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

The Company accounts separately for the liability and equity components of the 2016 Notes in accordance with authoritative guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion.  The guidance requires the carrying amount of the liability component to be estimated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated conversion feature.  Because the Company has no outstanding non-convertible public debt, the Company determined that senior, unsecured corporate bonds traded on the market represent a similar liability to the convertible senior notes without the conversion option.  Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its 2016 Notes to be

4.5%

, assuming no conversion option.  Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs.  The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the 2016 Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of

$748.5 million

upon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the

$920.0 million

aggregate principal amount.  The

$155.4 million

difference between the cash proceeds of

$903.9 million

and the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital as the 2016 Notes were not considered redeemable.

In conjunction with the issuance of the 2019 and 2021 Notes, the Company used the net proceeds from the issuance plus cash on hand to repurchase

$600.0 million

in principal amount of the outstanding 2016 Notes in privately negotiated transactions.  The aggregate cash used for the repurchase was

$1,244.7 million

.  The repurchase is accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. Extinguishment accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the liability and equity components of the repurchased notes based on the fair value of the liability component, and the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liability component to be recognized as loss on extinguishment of debt.  An interest rate of

1.2%

upon settlement, which was estimated using Level 2 inputs, was applied to measure the fair value of the liability component of the extinguished debt.  This calculation resulted in

$588.8 million

allocated to the debt component and

$655.9 million

allocated to the equity component.  The

$31.4 million

difference between the

$588.8 million

fair value of debt component and the carrying value of the repurchased 2016 Notes was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt within other expense, net, during the three and six months ended June 29, 2014.  The

$655.9 million

of the repurchase price allocated to the equity component was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

As a policy election under applicable guidance related to the calculation of diluted net income per share, the Company elected the combination settlement method as its stated settlement policy and applied the treasury stock method in the calculation of dilutive impact of the 2016 Notes.  During the years ended December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012, the 2016 Notes were not convertible.  However, as the market price of the Company’s common stock exceeded the conversion price during the last months of 2013, the calculation of dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the year ended December 29, 2013 reflects the dilutive impact from the 2016 Notes.  The 2016 Notes had no dilutive impact for the year ended December 30, 2012.  If the 2016 Notes were converted as of

December 28, 2014

, the if-converted value would exceed the principal amount by

$393.3 million

.

0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014

In 2007, the Company issued

$400.0 million

principal amount of

0.625%

convertible senior notes due 2014 (2014 Notes).  The Company pays

0.625%

interest per annum on the principal amount of the 2014 Notes semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year.  The 2014 Notes matured on

February 15, 2014

.  The effective interest rate of the liability component was estimated to be

8.3%

.

The Company entered into hedge transactions concurrently with the issuance of the 2014 Notes under which the Company was entitled to purchase up to approximately

18.3 million

shares of the Company’s common stock at a strike price of approximately

$21.83

per share, subject to adjustment.  The convertible note hedge transactions had the effect of reducing dilution to the Company’s stockholders upon conversion of the 2014 Notes.  Also concurrently with the issuance of the 2014 Notes, the Company sold to the hedge counterparties warrants exercisable, on a cashless basis, for up to approximately

18.3 million

shares of the Company’s common stock at a strike price of

$31.435

per share, subject to adjustment.  The proceeds from these warrants partially offset the cost to the Company of the convertible note hedge transactions.

The 2014 Notes were convertible into cash and shares of the Company’s common stock in various prior periods and became convertible again from

April 1, 2012

through, and including,

February 12, 2014

, by which date all notes were converted.  In all cases of conversions of the 2014 Notes, the principal amount converted was repaid with cash and the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount was paid in shares of common stock.  The equity dilution resulting from the issuance of common stock related to the conversion of the 2014 Notes was offset by repurchase of the same amount of shares under the convertible note hedge transactions, which were automatically exercised in accordance with their terms at the time of each conversion.  Accordingly, the hedge transactions terminated concomitant with the conversions of the 2014 Notes.

As a result of the conversions during the year ended

December 28, 2014

, the Company recorded losses on extinguishment of debt calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of the debt and the carrying value of the notes as of the settlement dates.  To measure the fair value of the converted notes as of the settlement dates, the applicable interest rates were estimated using Level 2 observable inputs and applied to the converted notes using the same methodology as in the issuance date valuation.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In connection with the unsolicited tender offer by Roche (refer to note “15. Unsolicited Tender Offer”), on January 25, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (Right) for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock.  Each Right entitled the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company’s Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value

$0.01

per share (Preferred Shares), at a price of

$275.00

per

one thousandth

of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment.  The Rights were not exercisable until such time that the Board of Directors determined to eliminate its deferral of the date on which separate Rights certificates are issued and the Rights traded separately from the Company’s common stock (Distribution Date).  If a person or group (triggering party) acquired

15%

or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, each Right would have entitled holders other than the triggering party to purchase, at the exercise price of the Right, a number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.  If the Company was acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person acquires

15%

or more of the Company’s common stock, each Right would have entitled holders other than the triggering party to purchase, at the Right’s then-current exercise price, a number of common shares of the acquiring company that at the time of such transaction have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.  The Board of Directors would have been entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of

$0.001

per Right at any time before the Distribution Date.  The Board of Directors would have been entitled to exchange the Rights at an exchange ratio per Right of

one

share of common stock after any person acquires beneficial ownership of

15%

or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock, and prior to the acquisition of

50%

or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock.  In 2013, the expiration date was amended to March 27, 2013, from January 26, 2017, and the Rights expired accordingly.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, employment, and contractual matters.  In connection with these matters, the Company assesses, on a regular basis, the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters.  A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events.  The Company regularly reviews outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures.  The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.  Each matter presents its own unique circumstances, and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome, or range of outcomes, in any individual proceeding.  Because of the uncertainties related to the occurrence, amount, and range of loss on any pending litigation or claim, the Company is currently unable to predict their ultimate outcome, and, with respect to any pending litigation or claim where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  In the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims, any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals, individually or in the aggregate,



ILLUMINA, INC.

could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable, and potentially in future periods.

Syntrix

On November 24, 2010, Syntrix Biosystems, Inc. (“Syntrix”) filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma (Case No. C10-5870-BHS) alleging that the Company willfully infringed U.S. Patent No. 6,951,682 by selling its BeadChip array products, and that the Company misappropriated Syntrix’s trade secrets.  On January 30, 2013, the Court granted the Company’s motion for summary judgment on Syntrix’s trade secret claims, and dismissed those claims from the case.  On March 14, 2013, a jury reached a verdict in favor of Syntrix, finding that Illumina’s BeadChip kits infringe the Syntrix patent.  During trial, the Court dismissed Syntrix’s claim that the alleged infringement was willful.  On July 1, 2013, the Court entered a Final Amended Judgment for

$115.1 million

, in accordance with the jury verdict, including supplemental damages and prejudgment interest.  In addition, the Court awarded Syntrix an ongoing royalty of

8%

for accused sales from March 15, 2013 until the patent expires on September 16, 2019.  On December 3, 2013, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the Final Amended Judgment.  On December 16, 2013, Syntrix cross appealed the Court’s dismissal of its trade secret claims and denial of its willfulness claim.  For the year ended December 29, 2013, the Company recorded total charges of

$132.9 million

related to this matter,

$114.6 million

of which was recorded within operating expenses, with the remainder recorded to cost of sales.

On November 14, 2014, the Company entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Syntrix and its sole shareholders, John A. Zebala and Amy Zebala, that settled all claims in the litigation. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement and License Agreement, the Company paid Syntrix a one-time payment of

$70.0 million

in exchange for a release of past damages claimed and a fully paid-up exclusive license to U.S. Patent No. 6,951,682.  None of the parties made any admission of liability in entering into the Settlement and License Agreement.  On November 19, 2014, the Court dismissed the litigation with prejudice and vacated the judgment against the Company.   The Company allocated the

$70.0 million

payment on relative fair value basis, resulting in

$29.5 million

capitalized as an intangible asset for the value of the exclusive license, which is amortized over a period of

4.8 years

on a straight-line basis, and the remaining

$40.5 million

to the release of past damages claimed.  The fair value of license and past damages was estimated using a discounted cash flow model, and is considered to be a Level 3 measurement.

As of September 28, 2014, the Company had accrued

$148.8 million

for damages and interest awarded to Syntrix.  The settlement of the litigation resulted in a gain of

$109.4 million

, calculated as the difference between the accrual released and the amount of payment allocated to the release of past damages claimed.

$27.3 million

of the total gain was recorded as reversal of cost of sales, reflecting a true-up of historical royalty expenses to the effective royalty rate.  The remaining gain of

$82.1 million

was recorded as a legal contingency gain in operating expenses.  In conjunction with the settlement, a

$33.5 million

deposit with the Court, which was reported in prepaid expenses, was released.

Sequenom

On December 2, 2014, the Company and its subsidiary Verinata Health, Inc. entered into a series of agreements with Sequenom, Inc. (“Sequenom”), its subsidiary Sequenom Center for Molecular Medicine LLC (“Sequenom LLC”), and Chinese University of Hong Kong (“CUHK”), and an agreement with the Trustees of Leland Stanford University (“Stanford”), that, together, (1) settled a patent litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) between Verinata and Stanford, on the one hand, and Sequenom, Sequenom LLC, and Isis Innovation Limited (“Isis”), on the other hand, (2) requested remand of certain claims and counterclaims of Sequenom, Isis, Verinata, and Stanford from the appeal pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of a second patent litigation pending in District Court in order to seek to vacate an order related to those claims and dismiss them, and (3) settled an inter partes review related to a United States Patent No. 8,195,415, assigned to Stanford and licensed to Verinata.

As part of the settlement, the Company and Sequenom have entered into a Pooled Patents Agreement and related sublicense agreements whereby (1) Sequenom granted Illumina a worldwide license to patents directed to Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (“NIPT”) for Laboratory Developed Testing (“LDT”) and In-Vitro Diagnostic (“IVD”) products, which license is exclusive in the LDT field, except with respect to certain patents formerly owned by Isis, in which case it is non-exclusive, and (2) Illumina (and Verinata in some cases) granted a worldwide non-exclusive license to Sequenom under Illumina-owned and in-licensed NIPT-related patents for Sequenom to continue its business related to NIPT LDT (the patents owned or in-licensed by either the Company or Sequenom that fall under the Pooled Patents Agreement are the “Pooled Patents”).  The Company also assumed, by novation, amended exclusive patent licenses from CUHK to Sequenom and entered into several

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

new exclusive in-license agreements with CUHK related to CUHK patents directed to NIPT, and granted to Sequenom non-exclusive sublicenses under the Company’s license agreements with CUHK, Stanford, and General Hospital Corporation for Sequenom to practice NIPT LDT.  The Company and Sequenom also extended, amended, and restated their current supply agreement under which Sequenom purchases from the Company equipment and supplies for NIPT LDT and other clinical fields, and entered into a separate agreement whereby Sequenom transferred to the Company certain clinical samples and data useful in the development of NIPT IVD.

As consideration for the foregoing settlement arrangements, the Company agreed to pay Sequenom an aggregate of

$50.0 million

, as well as to pay royalties to Sequenom for sales of NIPT IVD products.  The Company and Sequenom also agreed to share revenues received for exploitation of the Pooled Patents in NIPT LDT.  None of the parties made any admission of liability in entering into these arrangements.  The parties filed certain stipulated motions with the Federal Circuit and District Court to vacate and dismiss the associated claims and counterclaims with prejudice, which motions have been granted by the respective courts.

The Company considered whether the elements received represented identifiable benefits that were sufficiently separable from the products it sells to Sequenom, and considered whether the value of these benefits could be reasonably estimated.  The Company identified the legal settlement, clinical samples, the IVD and LDT patent rights as elements.  The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the value of the patent rights, replacement cost to value the samples, and an assumed royalty rate on historical sales for the legal settlement.  These fair value estimates are considered Level 3 measurements.  The Company determined that the aggregate fair value of the benefits received exceeded the consideration paid and allocated the

$50.0 million

payment to the various elements on a relative fair value basis.  This resulted in

$48.8 million

allocated to the samples and patent rights transferred to Illumina, which were expensed in research and development expenses due to lack of alternative future use.  The remaining

$1.2 million

was recorded as a legal contingency charge in operating expenses.

Income Taxes

The income before income taxes summarized by region is as follows (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The provision for income taxes reconciles to the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to income before taxes as follows (in thousands):

The impact of foreign operations primarily represents the difference between the actual provision for income taxes for our legal entities that operate primarily in jurisdictions that have statutory tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of

35%

.  The most significant tax benefits from foreign operations were from the Company’s earnings in Singapore and the United Kingdom, which had statutory tax rates of

17%

and

21.5%

, respectively, in the year ended December 28, 2014.  The impact of foreign operations also includes the U.S. foreign tax credit impact of non-U.S. earnings and uncertain tax positions related to foreign items.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved.  The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence.  Based on the available evidence as of

December 28, 2014

, the Company was not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized.  Therefore, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of

$15.2 million

against certain U.S. deferred tax assets.



ILLUMINA, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the year ended

December 28, 2014

, the valuation allowance decreased by

$3.9 million

, primarily due to a

$10.4 million

decrease in the provision for income taxes related to foreign tax credits utilized in the U.S., offset by a

$6.0 million

increase in the provision for income taxes related to state research and development credits generated in the current year.

As of

December 28, 2014

, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of

$163.6 million

and

$295.0 million

, respectively, which will begin to expire in


and


, respectively, unless utilized prior.  The Company also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of

$15.3 million

and

$63.7 million

, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2024 and 2019, respectively, unless utilized prior.

Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of the Company’s net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in its ownership structure.  These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization.  The deferred tax assets as of

December 28, 2014

are net of any previous limitations due to Section 382 and 383.

The Company recognizes excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation to stockholders’ equity only when realized.  When assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation have been realized, the Company follows the with-and-without approach excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions.  Under this approach, excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to the Company.  During the year ended

December 28, 2014

, the Company realized

$126.5 million

of such excess tax benefits, and accordingly recorded a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital.  As of

December 28, 2014

, the Company had

$36.8 million

of unrealized excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation.  These tax benefits will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital, if and when realized, rather than a reduction of the provision for income taxes.

The Company’s manufacturing operations in Singapore operate under various tax holidays and incentives that begin to expire in 2018.  For the year ended

December 28, 2014

, these tax holidays and incentives resulted in a

$15.6 million

decrease to the provision for income taxes and an increase in net income per diluted share of

$0.10

.

It is the Company’s intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in order to ensure sufficient working capital to support and expand existing operations outside the United States.  Accordingly, residual U.S. income taxes have not been provided on

$395.6 million

of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of

December 28, 2014

.  In the event the Company was required to repatriate funds from outside of the United States, such repatriation would be subject to local laws, customs, and tax consequences.

The following table summarizes the gross amount of the Company’s uncertain tax positions (in thousands):

Included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of

December 28, 2014

, and

December 29, 2013

, were

$42.6 million

and

$40.1 million

, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Company’s effective income tax rate in future periods.

Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are reflected in the provision for income taxes.  The Company recognized expense of

$0.7 million

,

$1.0 million

, and

$0.8 million

, related to potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions during the years ended

December 28, 2014

,

December 29, 2013

, and

December 30, 2012

, respectively.  The Company recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of

$4.4 million

and

$3.5 million

as of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, respectively.

The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for tax year 2011.  The IRS has not yet proposed any adjustments to the filed return.  Tax years


to


remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax.  Given the uncertainty of potential adjustments from the current examination as well as the impact of the current examination on the potential expiration of the statute of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly over the next 12 months.  However, at this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined given the number of matters being examined and the number of years that are potentially subject to examination.

80%

of their base salary and

100%

of their variable cash compensation.  Members of the board of directors can contribute up to

The vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.  However, all employer contributions shall become 100% vested upon the occurrence of the participant’s disability, death or retirement or a change in control of the Company.  The benefits under this plan are unsecured.  Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with the Company for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A.  As of

December 28, 2014

, no employer contributions were made to the Plan.

In January 2008, the Company also established a rabbi trust for the benefit of the participants under the Plan.  In accordance with authoritative guidance related to consolidation of variable interest entities and accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested, the Company has included the assets of the rabbi trust in its consolidated balance sheet since the trust’s inception.  As of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, the assets of the trust were

$23.5 million

and

$17.8 million

, respectively, and liabilities of the Company were

$20.3 million

and

$15.0 million

, respectively.  The assets and liabilities are classified as other assets and accrued liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the values of the assets held by the rabbi trust are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income, and changes in the values of the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded in cost of sales or operating expenses.

Controls and Procedures.

We design our internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and our established financial policies.



Based on management’s evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During the fourth quarter of


, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting.

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of


and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  The evaluation did not identify any such change.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).  Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 28, 2014

.  The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 28, 2014

has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Illumina, Inc.

We have audited Illumina, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 28, 2014

, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Illumina, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Illumina, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 28, 2014

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Illumina, Inc. as of

December 28, 2014

and

December 29, 2013

, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended

December 28, 2014

of Illumina, Inc. and our report dated
