PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Zions Bancorporation
(“the Parent”) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the State of Utah in 1955, and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The Parent and its subsidiaries
(collectively “the Company”) own and operate eight commercial banks with a total of 475 offices at year-end 2005. The Company provides a full range of banking and related services through its banking and other subsidiaries, primarily in
Utah, California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 10,102 at year-end 2005. For further information about the Company’s industry segments, see “Business Segment
Results” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For information about the Company’s foreign operations, see “Foreign Operations” in
MD&A. The “Executive Summary” in MD&A provides further information about the Company.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The Company focuses on
maintaining community-minded banking services by continuously strengthening its core business lines of retail banking, small and medium-sized business lending, residential mortgage, and investment activities. It operates eight different banks in ten
Western states with each bank operating under a different name and each having its own chief executive officer and management team. The banks provide a wide variety of commercial and retail banking and mortgage lending products and services. The
Company provides commercial loans, lease financing, cash management, electronic check clearing, lockbox, customized draft processing, and other special financial services for business and other commercial banking customers. The Company also provides
a wide range of personal banking services to individuals, including home mortgages, bankcard, student and other installment loans, home equity lines of credit, checking accounts, savings accounts, time certificates of various types and maturities,
trust services, safe deposit facilities, direct deposit, and 24-hour ATM access. In addition, certain banking subsidiaries provide services to key market segments through their Women’s Financial, Private Client Services, and Executive Banking
Groups. We also offer wealth management services through a subsidiary, Contango Capital Advisors, Inc., that was launched in 2004.

In addition to these core businesses, the Company has built specialized lines of business in capital markets and public finance and is also a leader in U.S. Small
Business Administration lending. Through its eight banking subsidiaries, the Company provides Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) loans to small businesses throughout the United States and is also one of the largest providers of SBA
504 financing in the nation. The Company owns an equity interest in the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and is the nation’s top originator of secondary market agricultural real estate mortgage loans through
Farmer Mac. The Company is a leader in municipal finance advisory and underwriting services. The Company also controls four venture capital companies that provide early-stage capital, primarily for start-up companies located in the Western United
States.

COMPETITION

As a result of the diverse financial services and products it offers, the Company operates
in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include not only other banks, thrift institutions and credit unions, but also insurance companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies,
and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Most of these entities compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers with increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in many significant products.
In addition, many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the Company. These competitive trends are likely to continue.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

On July 30, 2002, the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States (Congress) enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law that addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and
accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of


corporate information. The Nasdaq has also adopted corporate governance rules, which intend to allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the
performance of companies and their directors.

The Board of Directors of the
Parent has implemented a system of strong corporate governance practices. This system included Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and charters for the Audit, Credit Review, Executive Compensation, and Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committees. More information on the Company’s corporate governance practices is available on the Company’s website at

www.zionsbancorporation.com

.

The enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“the GLB Act”) represented a
pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry. The GLB Act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the Depression Era of the 1930s. Effective March 11, 2000, new opportunities became available
for banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into business combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services.
The GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework through a financial holding company, which has as its umbrella regulator the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”). The functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding
company is conducted by the subsidiary’s primary functional regulator. To qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company, a company must satisfy certain ongoing criteria.

The GLB Act also provides federal regulations dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal
information of individual customers, which the Company and its subsidiaries must comply with. In addition, the Company, including its subsidiaries, is subject to various other federal and state laws that deal with the use and disclosure of nonpublic
personal information.

The Parent is a financial holding company and, as such,
is subject to the BHC Act. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for a financial holding company to acquire or hold more than 5% voting interest in any bank. The BHC Act allows, subject to certain limitations, interstate bank
acquisitions and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country.

The BHC Act restricts the Company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the FRB to be financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or
complementary to a financial activity. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies.

The Company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions in both the laws of the United States and
the states in which the banks operate. These include restrictions on:

•

transactions with affiliates;

•

the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates;

•

the nature and amount of any investments;

•

their ability to act as an underwriter of securities;

•

the opening of branches; and

•

the acquisition of other financial entities.

In addition, the Company’s subsidiary banks are subject to either the provisions of the National Bank Act or the banking laws of their respective states, as well as
the rules and regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). They are also under the supervision of, and are subject to periodic examination by, the OCC or
their respective state banking departments, the FRB, and the FDIC.

The FRB has
established capital guidelines for financial holding companies. The OCC, the FDIC, and the FRB have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Company and its
subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding capital requirements.

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (the “BIS”). The BIS is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to
determine the supervisory policies they apply. In January 2001, the BIS released a proposal to replace the 1988 accord with a new capital framework that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital
requirements for credit risk and market risk


exposures. Operational risk is defined by the proposal to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people and systems or from external events. The 1988 accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk.

In January 2005, the U.S. banking regulators issued an interagency statement with regard to the U.S. implementation of the Basel II Framework. They have set January 2008
as the effective date for the final regulations, with mid-year 2006 for the publication of the final rule. The regulators have previously stated that approximately the ten largest U.S. bank holding companies will be required to adopt the new
standard, and that others may elect to “opt in”. We do not currently expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company, as the Company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt
Basel II. However, we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to companies that do adopt the framework will make it necessary for the Company to elect to “opt in” at some point, and we have begun investing in the required
capabilities.

Also, in October 2005, the U.S. banking regulators issued an
interagency Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for modifications to the Basel I framework for those banks not adopting Basel II. The regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the numerous comments received on this proposal, which is commonly
referred to as Basel 1a.

Dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to the
Parent are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. These restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at year-end are summarized in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 provides that the
Company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of insured banks. These standards relate to internal
controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking
regulatory agencies.

The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires
banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including credit to low and moderate income individuals. Should the Company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of
applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. The GLB Act requires “satisfactory” or higher CRA compliance for insured depository institutions and their
financial holding companies for them to engage in new financial activities. If one of the Company’s banks should receive a CRA rating of less than satisfactory, the Company could lose its status as a financial holding company.

On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism
legislation known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”). Title III of the USA Patriot Act substantially broadens the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due
diligence obligations, defining new crimes and related penalties, and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department (“the Treasury”) has issued a number of implementation regulations, which
apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. The Company’s bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the Company’s subsidiaries must comply
with these regulations. These regulations also impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing.

Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act’s requirements
could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Company has adopted appropriate policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and
will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the Act and the Treasury’s regulations.

Regulators, Congress, and state legislatures continue to enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers. The nature
of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.


GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES

The earnings and business of the Company are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental
authorities. The Company is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which affects the national supply of bank credit. The methods of monetary policy available to the FRB include:

•

open-market operations in U.S. government securities;

•

adjustment of the discount rates or cost of bank borrowings;

•

imposing or changing reserve requirements against member bank deposits; and

•

imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.

These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans, investments and deposits, and
the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.

In view of the
changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the FRB’s monetary policies, it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand, deposit levels and interest rates, or their effect on the business and earnings of the Company. FRB
monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following list describes several risk factors which are significant to the Company:

•

In December 2005 the Company completed its merger with Amegy Bancorporation, Inc. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the projected cost
savings from the merger and on the continued growth and profitability of Amegy. We have been successful with prior mergers, but it is possible that the merger and integration process with Amegy could result in the loss of key employees, disruptions
in controls, procedures and policies, or other factors that could affect our ability to realize the projected savings and successfully retain and grow the Amegy customer base.

•

Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Over the last two years we have experienced historically high levels of credit quality. We do not see any indications that credit
quality will significantly deteriorate, but it is unlikely that we will be able to maintain credit quality at these levels indefinitely. Economic conditions in the high growth geographical areas in which our banks operate have been strong, but
events could result in weaker economic conditions including deterioration of property values that could significantly increase the Company’s credit risk.

•

Net interest income is the largest component of the Company’s revenue. The management of interest rate risk for the Company and all bank subsidiaries is centralized and
overseen by an Asset Liability Management Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company has been successful in its interest rate risk management as evidenced by its achieving a relatively stable interest rate margin over
the last several years when interest rates have been volatile and the rate environment challenging. Factors beyond the Company’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the Company’s risk. These
factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits and volatile market interest rates subject to general economic conditions and the polices of governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the Federal Reserve Board.

•

The Company is exposed to accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory/compliance risk. The Company provides to its customers a number of complex financial products and services.
Estimates, judgments and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services. Identification, interpretation and implementation of complex and
changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements therefore pose an ongoing risk.

•

A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of
the Company. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations.

•

We have a number of business initiatives that, while we believe they will ultimately produce profits for our shareholders, currently generate expenses in excess of
revenues. Two significant initiatives are Contango, a wealth


management business started in 2004, and NetDeposit, a subsidiary that provides electronic check processing systems. Our management of these businesses takes into account the
development of revenues and control of expenses so that results of operations are not adverse to an extent that is not warranted by the opportunities these businesses provide.

•

U.S. and international regulators have proposed new capital standards commonly known as “Basel II”. These standards would apply to a number of our largest competitors, and
potentially give them a significant competitive advantage. Sophisticated systems and data are required in order to adopt Basel II standards; the Company is developing but does not yet have these systems and data. More recently, U.S. banking
regulators have proposed a possible “Basel 1a” standard that they think might reduce competitive inequities. However, our initial analysis indicates that a significant risk of competitive inequity would persist between banks operating
under Basel 1a and those using Basel II.

The Company’s
Board of Directors has established an Enterprise-wide Risk Management policy and appointed an Enterprise Risk Management Committee to oversee and implement the policy. In addition to credit and interest rate risk, the Committee also oversees and
monitors the following risk areas: market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, information technology risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

At year-end 2005, the Company operated 473 domestic branches, of which 220 are owned and 253 are on leased premises. The Company also leases its headquarter offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. Other operations facilities
are variously owned or leased. The annual rentals under long-term leases for leased premises are determined under various formulas and factors, including operating costs, maintenance, and taxes. For information regarding rental payments, see Note 19
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

An evaluation was carried out by the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, these disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to affect the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. See “Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” on page 78 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for management’s report on the adequacy of internal control over financial
reporting. Also see “Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” issued by Ernst & Young LLP on page 79 of the Annual Report to Shareholders.

The Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2005 does not include the
internal controls of Amegy Corporation (acquired on December 3, 2005). This is consistent with the views of the staffs of the Office of the Chief Accountant and the Division of Corporation Finance in their response to Question 3 in the
