ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Zions Bancorporation, National Association and its subsidiaries (collectively “Zions Bancorporation, N.A.,” “the Bank,” “we,” “our,” “us”) is a national commercial bank headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Bank owns and operates


branches at year-end


. The Bank provides a full range of banking and related services, primarily in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The Bank conducts its operations through seven separately managed and branded segments, which we sometimes refer to as “affiliates” or by reference to their respective brands. Full-time equivalent employees totaled

10,201

at

December 31, 2018

. For further information about the Bank’s industry segments, see “Business Segment Results” on page


in MD&A and Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For information about the Bank’s foreign operations, see “Foreign Exposure and Operations” on page


in MD&A. The “Executive Summary” on page


in MD&A provides further information about the Bank.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The Bank focuses on providing community banking services by continuously strengthening its core business lines of (1) small- and medium-sized business and corporate banking; (2) commercial and residential development, construction and term lending; (3) retail banking; (4) treasury cash management and related products and services; (5) residential mortgage lending and servicing; (6) trust and wealth management; (7) limited capital markets activities, including municipal finance advisory and underwriting; and (8) investment activities. It operates primarily through seven geographic regions, each with its own local branding, chief executive officer and management team.

In addition to providing a wide variety of commercial products and services, the Bank provides a range of personal banking services to individuals, including home mortgages, bankcard, other installment loans, home equity lines of credit, checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit of various types and maturities, trust services, safe deposit facilities, and Internet and mobile banking. The Bank provides services to key market segments through its Private Client Services and Executive Banking Groups. It offers self-directed brokerage services through Zions Direct and also offers comprehensive and personalized wealth management and investment services.

The Bank has built specialized lines of business in capital markets and public finance and is a leader in small business administration (“SBA”) lending. The Bank is one of the nation’s largest providers of SBA 7(a) and SBA 504 financing to small businesses. It owns an equity interest in FAMC and is its top originator of secondary market agricultural real estate mortgage loans. The Bank provides finance advisory and corporate trust services for municipalities. The Bank also provides bond transfer, stock transfer, and escrow services nationally in its corporate trust business.

COMPETITION

The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Bank’s most direct competition for loans and deposits comes from other commercial banks, credit unions, and thrifts, including institutions that do not have a physical presence in our market footprint but solicit via the Internet and other means. In addition, the Bank competes with finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, financial technology and other non-traditional lending and banking companies, and a variety of other types of companies. These companies may have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures or tax burdens.

The primary factors in competing for business include the quality of service delivered, our local community knowledge, convenience of office locations, online banking functionality and other delivery methods, range of products offered, pricing and the overall relationship with our clients. The Bank must compete effectively along all of these dimensions to remain successful.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

This section describes the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the business and results of the Bank.

On September 30, 2018, we completed the merger of Zions Bancorporation, the Bank’s former holding company, with and into Zions Bancorporation, N.A., sometimes referred to herein as the “restructuring.” More information about the restructuring and its effects can be found in the proxy statement filed by Zions Bancorporation with the SEC on July 24, 2018. In connection with completing the restructuring, we also received approval of an application filed with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) seeking a determination that the Bank is not “systemically important” as defined by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). As a result of the restructuring and FSOC approval:

•

The Bank is the top-level publicly-traded entity within our corporate structure.

•

The Bank is no longer subject to:

◦

Examinations by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The Bank’s primary regulator is the OCC and continues to be subject to examinations by the Bureau for Consumer Finance Protection, commonly referred to as the CFPB, with respect to consumer financial regulations;

◦

Certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, as more fully described below;

◦

The Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), but remains subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the reporting requirements thereunder. However, this will not inhibit the Bank’s ability to raise capital. The Bank is subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings and continues to make filings required under the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer.

The banking and financial services business in which we engage is and remains highly regulated. Such regulation is intended, among other things, to improve the stability of banking and financial companies and to protect the interests of customers, including both loan customers and depositors, and taxpayers. These regulations are not, however, generally intended to protect the interests of our shareholders or creditors, and in fact may have the consequence of reducing returns to our shareholders. Banking laws and regulations promulgated thereunder have given financial regulators expanded powers over many aspects of the financial services industry, which have reduced and may continue to reduce returns earned by shareholders.

Legislative changes to laws governing the financial industry occur frequently; some of this legislation materially affects the manner in which we and other financial institutions operate, including increasing the costs and other burdens of conducting our businesses. In addition, the banking agencies regularly promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations, which also have significant impact on the financial industry. The content and impact of such regulatory changes cannot presently be determined. The Bank is committed to both satisfying regulatory expectations and providing attractive shareholder returns. However, given the ever-evolving regulatory environment, the results of these efforts cannot yet be known.

General

The Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and other statutes governing national banks, as well as the rules and regulations of the OCC, the CFPB, and the FDIC. It is also subject to examination and supervision by the OCC and examination by the CFPB in respect of federal consumer financial regulations. The Bank, as well as some of its subsidiaries, is also subject to regulation by other federal and state agencies. These regulatory agencies may exert considerable influence over our activities through their supervisory and examination roles. Our brokerage and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and/or state securities regulators.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The National Bank Act

Prior to the restructuring, Zions Bancorporation’s corporate affairs were governed by Utah state law and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. Each of these legal regimes is well-developed and used widely by public companies.

Following the restructuring, the Bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act and related regulations administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, the Bank is not subject to the Securities Act, but is subject to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. The Bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to banks such as the Bank, though the Bank continues to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a voluntary filer. These statutory and regulatory regimes are not as well developed as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to many other publicly held corporations. See discussion under “

Risk Factors

.”

The Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations broadly affect the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act involves mandatory divestiture of certain equity investments, increasing regulation of executive and incentive-based compensation, requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies, and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector.

Regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require many banks to maintain greater levels of capital and liquid assets than was generally the case prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and limit the forms of capital that such banks rely upon for regulatory purposes. Certain bank holding companies and other financial institutions, known as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, are required to adhere to “enhanced prudential supervision” requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis (“CCAR”) process administered by the FRB, which in effect requires SIFIs to maintain capital based on hypothetical scenarios dictated by the FRB. As a result of the restructuring and FSOC approval, the Bank is no longer subject to these requirements (including the prior non-objection requirement under CCAR for declaring any dividends or share repurchases), or the liquidity and capital requirements applicable to SIFIs. However, the Bank continues to be subject to the OCC’s heightened standard guidelines, which establish enhanced requirements for national banks with assets of $50 billion or more, and other regulatory requirements that reduce its flexibility to return capital to shareholders and respond to market developments and opportunities in such areas as capital raising and acquisitions. Additionally, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, also known as “the Crapo Bill,” was signed into law, reducing regulatory requirements for many banking institutions and exempting the Bank from the capital planning actions as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions and related regulations also affect the fees we must pay to regulatory agencies and the pricing of certain products and services, including the following:

•

The assessment base for federal deposit insurance was changed to consolidated assets less tangible capital instead of the amount of insured deposits.

•

The federal prohibition on the payment of interest on business transaction accounts was repealed.

•

The FRB was authorized to issue and did issue regulations governing debit card interchange fees.

The Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, which is responsible for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers’ financial interests and examining large financial institutions for compliance with, and enforcing, those regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act adds prohibitions on unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices to the scope of consumer protection regulations overseen and enforced by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act subjected national banks to the possibility of further regulation by restricting the preemption of state laws by federal laws. Restricting the scope of federal preemption could burden national banks with the requirement that they also comply with certain state laws covering matters already covered by federal law. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives greater power to state attorneys general to pursue legal actions against banking organizations for violations of federal law.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Bank and other companies subject to the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to a number of requirements regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to its key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, which are being imposed through the supervisory process as well as published guidance and proposed rules. These restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act include documentation and governance, deferral, risk-balancing, and clawback requirements. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or engage in other activities, or could result in regulatory enforcement actions.

During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including the Bank). The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion, such as the Bank, and further, more stringent requirements for those with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion. The general qualitative requirements include: (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping. For larger financial institutions, including the Bank, the proposed revised regulations would also introduce very prescriptive requirements relating to the types and percentages, the timing of the realization, and the risk of forfeiture of incentive compensation awarded to “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers.” The regulators have not yet issued any final rules.

Capital Standards - Basel Framework

In 2013, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC published final rules (the “Basel III capital rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III capital rules effectively replaced the Basel I capital rules and implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III capital rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Bank, compared to the Basel I U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III capital rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components. In November 2017, the FRB, FDIC and OCC published a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain U.S. Basel III capital rules for non-advanced approaches banks, such as the Bank. Effective January 1, 2018, the final rule retains the 2017 Basel III transitional treatment of certain DTAs and mortgage servicing assets, among others. As a result, since January 1, 2018, our DTAs and mortgage servicing assets retained their 2017 risk weight treatment until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the November 2017 transitional rule.

The Basel III capital rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III capital rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replaced the risk-weighting approach derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee’s 2004 Basel II capital accords. The Basel III capital rules also implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules.

The Basel III capital rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) applied most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios, and (iv) expanded the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations.

Under the Basel III capital rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

•

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

•

6.0% Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets;

•

8.0% Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets; and

•

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).

As of January 1, 2019, the Basel III capital rules also require the Bank to maintain a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The severity of the constraint depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effect not reflected in net income).

The Basel III capital rules also prescribed a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expanded the risk-weighting categories from Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, to 1,250% for certain securitization exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the Basel III capital rules provided more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increased the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

The Basel III capital rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, DTAs dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. The application of this part of the rule did not result in any deductions from CET1 for us.

Under prior Basel I capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios. As a “non-advanced approaches banking organization,” we made a one-time permanent election as of January 1, 2015 to continue to exclude these items, as allowed under the Basel III capital rules.

Basel III also required additional regulatory capital disclosures to be made that are commonly referred to as “Pillar 3” disclosures. These disclosures require the Bank to make prescribed regulatory disclosures on a quarterly basis regarding its capital structure adequacy and risk-weighted assets. The Bank began publishing these Pillar 3 disclosures in 2015, and such disclosures are available on the Bank’s website.

The Basel Committee has issued a series of updates that propose other changes to capital regulations. In one of these, the Basel Committee finalized a revised framework for calculating minimum capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations. The Basel Committee has set an effective date for reporting under the revised framework for market risk capital of January 1, 2022. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these revisions for U.S. banking organizations. The Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules as of December 31, 2018.

Capital Planning and Stress Testing

As a result of the successful completion of the restructuring and FSOC approval described elsewhere in this report, and the enactment of the Crapo Bill, the Bank is no longer required to participate in the FRB’s CCAR process or publicly disclose the results of stress testing or the Bank’s proposed capital actions. However, the Bank intends to continue to release the results of its internal stress tests, published to its website, as stress testing is the Bank’s



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

primary method of assessing capital adequacy. Prior to elimination of this requirement, however, the Bank submitted its 2018 capital plan and stress test results to the FRB. In its capital plan, the Bank was required to forecast for nine quarters, under a variety of hypothetical economic scenarios, its estimated regulatory capital ratios, and its generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) tangible common equity ratio. On June 21, 2018, we filed a Form 8-K with the SEC presenting the results of the Bank’s 2018 Dodd-Frank Act stress tests (“DFAST”). The results of the stress test demonstrated that the Bank had sufficient capital to withstand a severe hypothetical economic downturn. Detailed disclosure of the Bank’s 2018 DFAST results can also be found on our website. The Bank expects to continue to utilize its internal stress testing as an important mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically-stressed economic conditions.

Liquidity

Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the United States and internationally, without required formulaic measures. However, in January 2016, the FRB and other banking regulators adopted final rules (“Final Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) Rule”) implementing a U.S. version of the Basel Committee’s LCR requirement. The LCR is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of securities and other liquid assets to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30-day stress scenario. The Final LCR Rule applies to large, internationally active banking organizations (those with at least $250 billion in total assets or at least $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified, less stringent rule applies to bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that have at least $50 billion in total assets but are not internationally active banking organizations.

Following the restructuring, the Bank is no longer subject to the Final LCR Rule, despite having greater than $50 billion in total assets. The Bank continues to maintain strong on-balance sheet liquidity and a portfolio of liquid assets comparable to requirements in the rule.

Financial Privacy and Cyber Security

The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.

In October 2016, the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking addressed five categories of cyber standards: (1) cyber risk governance; (2) cyber risk management; (3) internal dependency management; (4) external dependency management; and (5) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. The comment period expired in February 2017; however, the regulators have not yet issued any revised proposed rules or final rules.

State regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including date encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. In June 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, which covers businesses that obtain or access personal information on California resident consumers, grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate. Other states have implemented, or are considering, similar privacy laws.

In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. We believe the applicability of the GDPR to us is minimal as we do not offer goods or services to EU residents or monitor their behaviors.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FDIC promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized, and critically under-capitalized. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA as modified by the Basel III capital rules, an insured depository institution generally will be classified as well-capitalized if it has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, and an insured depository institution generally will be classified as under-capitalized if its CET1 ratio is under 4.5%, its total risk-based capital ratio is less than 8%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is less than 6%, or its Tier 1 leverage ratio is less than 4%. An institution that, based upon its capital levels, is classified as “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” or “under-capitalized,” may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if a bank is classified in one of the under-capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the Federal bank regulator.

Other Regulations

The Bank is subject to a wide range of other requirements and restrictions contained in both the laws of the United States and the states in which its banks and other subsidiaries operate. These regulations include but are not limited to the following:

•

Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends on both its common and preferred stock is subject to regulatory restrictions. See discussion under “Liquidity Management Actions” on page


.

•

Safety and soundness requirements. Federal law requires that the Bank be operated in a safe and sound manner. We are subject to additional safety and soundness standards prescribed in the FDICIA, including standards related to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking agencies. The safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in their supervisory authority over us.

•

Requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities and restrictions on other activities. The National Bank Act requires regulatory and shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a non-affiliated non-bank. See discussion under “

Risk Factors

.” Other laws and regulations governing national banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities.

•

•

Anti-money laundering regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”), and other federal laws require financial institutions to assist U.S. Government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity.

The Bank is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (“NASDAQ”) has also adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors.

The Board of Directors of the Bank has overseen management’s establishment of a comprehensive system of corporate governance and risk practices. This system includes policies and guidelines such as Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Employees, a Directors Code of Conduct, a Related Party Transaction Policy, Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines, a Compensation Clawback Policy, an insider trading policy including provisions prohibiting hedging and placing restrictions on the pledging of bank stock by insiders, and charters for the Executive, Audit, Risk Oversight, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. More information on the Bank’s corporate governance practices is available on the Bank’s website at www.zionsbancorporation.com. (The Bank’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).

The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the banking, securities and other laws and regulations described above or otherwise applicable to the Bank. The Bank intends to make appropriate revisions to reflect any changes required.

Regulators, Congress, state legislatures, and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors. The nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the Bank cannot be predicted.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES

The earnings and business of the Bank are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by policies adopted by various governmental authorities. The Bank is particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which affect both short-term and long-term interest rates and the national supply of bank credit.

In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the FRB’s monetary policies, it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand, deposit levels and interest rates, or their effect on the business and earnings of the Bank. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The Bank’s growth strategy is driven by key factors while adhering to defined risk parameters. The key elements of the Bank’s strategy reflect its prudent risk-taking philosophy. The Bank generates revenue by taking prudent and appropriately priced risks. These factors are outlined in the Bank’s Risk Appetite Framework.

The Bank’s Board of Directors has established a Risk Oversight Committee of the Board, approved an Enterprise Risk Management Framework, and appointed an Enterprise Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”) to oversee and implement the Framework. The ERMC is comprised of senior management of the Bank and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank’s most significant risk exposure has traditionally come from the acceptance of credit risk inherent in prudent extension of credit to relationship customers. In addition to credit risk, these committees also monitor the following level one risk areas: market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic, business and corporate governance risk, operational/technology risk, cyber risk, model risk, capital/financial reporting risk, legal/compliance risk (including regulatory risk), and reputational risk as outlined in the bank’s risk taxonomy. Additional governance and oversight includes Board-approved policies and management committees with direct focus on these specific risk categories. Incorporated into each of these level one risks mentioned previously is third party vendor risk, which the Bank views as critical in the management and oversight of vendors.

Although not comprehensive, the following describes several risk factors that are significant to the Bank:

Credit Risk

Credit quality has adversely affected us in the past and may adversely affect us in the future.

Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. A decline in the strength of the U.S. economy in general or the local economies in which we conduct operations could result in, among other things, deterioration in credit quality and/or reduced demand for credit, including a resultant adverse effect on the income from our loan portfolio, an increase in charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”).

We have concentrations of risk in our loan portfolio, including loans secured by real estate, leveraged and enterprise value lending, and oil and gas-related lending, which may have unique risk characteristics that may adversely affect our results.

Concentration or counterparty risk could adversely affect the Bank. Concentration risk across our loan and investment portfolios could pose significant additional credit risk to the Bank due to exposures which perform in a similar fashion. Counterparty risk could also pose additional credit risk.

We engage in commercial construction and land acquisition and development lending, as well as commercial term lending, primarily in our western states footprint. The Bank, as a whole, has relatively larger concentrations of such lending than many other peer institutions. In addition, we have a concentration in oil and gas-related lending, primarily in Texas. Both commercial real estate (“CRE”) and oil and gas-related lending are subject to specific risks, including volatility and potential significant and prolonged declines in collateral-values and activity levels. In addition, our real estate lending is concentrated in the western states, and values there may behave differently than in other parts of the United States. We may have other unidentified concentrated or correlated risks in our loan portfolio.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our business is highly correlated to local economic conditions in a specific geographic region of the United States.

The Bank provides a full range of banking and related services through its local management teams and unique brands in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Approximately 79% and 78% of the Bank’s total net interest income relates to our banking operations in Utah, Texas, and California for the years ended

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

, respectively. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. Accordingly, adverse economic conditions affecting these three states in particular could significantly affect our consolidated operations and financial results. For example, our credit risk could be elevated to the extent that our lending practices in these three states focus on borrowers or groups of borrowers with similar economic characteristics, which are similarly affected by the same adverse economic events. At

December 31, 2018

, loan balances associated with our banking operations in Utah, Texas, and California comprised 79% of the Bank’s commercial lending portfolio, 73% of the CRE lending portfolio, and 69% of the consumer lending portfolio.

We have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.

Adverse economic conditions negatively affect the Bank’s assets, including its loan and securities portfolios, capital levels, results of operations, and financial condition. The most recent financial crisis resulted in significant regulatory changes that continue to affect the Bank. Although economic conditions have improved since the most recent financial crisis, it is possible that economic conditions may weaken. Economic and fiscal conditions in the United States and other countries may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic and market conditions faced by the Bank and its customers. Any sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions would adversely affect the Bank.

Market and Interest Rate Risks

Failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk and prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect us.

Net interest income is the largest component of the Bank’s revenue. Interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Management Committee, which is established by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect the Bank. Factors beyond the Bank’s control can significantly influence the interest rate environment and increase the Bank’s risk. These factors include competitive pricing pressures for our loans and deposits, adverse shifts in the mix of deposits and other funding sources, and volatile market interest rates resulting from general economic conditions and the policies of governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular the FRB.

Over the course of the last year, we have maintained a moderate level of asset-sensitivity as the market rates seemed more likely to increase than to decrease. As risks shifted at the end of the year to be more balanced between higher or lower rates in the future, the Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”) has undertaken strategies to reduce the level of asset-sensitivity, such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floating-rate assets to fixed-rate. We anticipate moving towards a less asset-sensitive interest rate risk position over the course of 2019.

Interest rates on the Bank’s financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to LIBOR, which could adversely impact the Bank’s revenue, expenses, and value of those financial instruments.

In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), along with various other regulatory bodies, announced that LIBOR would likely be discontinued at the end of 2021. LIBOR makes up the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and is commonly referenced in financial instruments. We have exposure to LIBOR in various aspects through our financial contracts. Instruments that may be impacted include loans, securities, and derivatives, among other financial contracts indexed to LIBOR and that mature after December 31, 2021.

While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of U.S. financial market participants, selected by the



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Federal Reserve Bank of New York, started in May 2018 to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR.

The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:

•

adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associate with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;

•

prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;

•

result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and

•

require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as SOFR.

The manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.

Liquidity Risk

As a regulated entity, we are subject to capital and liquidity requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth.

The Bank is

subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the OCC and the FDIC, including risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements, and Basel III liquidity requirements. Capital needs may rise above normal levels when we experience deteriorating earnings and credit quality, and our banking regulators may increase our capital requirements based on general economic conditions and our particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels. Although the Bank is not currently subject to the Final LCR Rule or the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”), it is possible that the Bank may become subject to a liquid coverage ratio requirement or other heightened liquidity requirements in the future if the OCC or another banking regulator apply such a requirement to the Bank as a supervisory matter. In addition, the Bank may become subject to any rule implementing the NSFR that is promulgated in the future. As a result, the Bank could be required to hold a higher portion of its assets in securities and other liquid assets and a lower portion of its assets in loans. Securities and other liquid assets generally have lower yields than loans of the type made by the Bank. For a summary of the capital rules to which we are subject, see “Capital Standards – Basel Framework” on page


of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We and/or the holders of our securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable rating actions from rating agencies.

Our ability to access the capital markets is important to our overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to us and particular classes of securities that we issue. The rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that we and/or our securities receive from recognized rating agencies. Ratings downgrades to us or our securities could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition or the market prices of our securities.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Strategic, Business and Corporate Governance Risks

Problems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on us.

The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Information security and vendor management processes are in place to actively identify, manage and monitor actual and potential impacts.

The regulation of incentive compensation under the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect our ability to retain our highest performing employees.

The bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and proposed regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.

We have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes to the Bank that include, among other things, organizational restructurings, efficiency initiatives, and replacement or upgrades of certain core technological systems to improve our control environment, and operating efficiency. The ultimate success and completion of these changes, and their effect on the Bank, may vary significantly from initial planning, which could materially adversely affect the Bank.

Over the last several years, the Bank has completed numerous improvement projects, including the merger of its bank holding company into the Bank, combining the legal charters of our seven affiliate banks into one, consolidating 15 loan operations sites into two, upgrading our accounting systems, installing a credit origination work flow system, streamlining our small business and retail lending, mortgage, wealth management and foreign exchange businesses, and investing in data quality and information security. Ongoing investment continues in a multi-year project to replace our core loan and deposit systems, a collection of customer-facing digital capabilities and a variety of other projects to simplify how we do business.

These changes continue to be implemented; some of the projects are fully completed, and some projects are in their early stages. By their very nature, projections of duration, cost, expected savings, expected efficiencies, and related items are subject to change and significant variability.

We may encounter significant adverse developments in the completion and implementation of these changes. These may include significant time delays, cost overruns, loss of key people, technological problems, processing failures, and other adverse developments. Any or all of these issues could result in disruptions to our systems, processes, control environment, procedures, and employees, which may adversely impact our customers and our ability to conduct business.

We have plans, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the negative effect of these potential adverse developments. However, there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately remediated. The ultimate effect of any adverse development could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could materially affect the Bank, including its control environment, operating efficiency, and results of operations.

Operational/Technology Risks

Catastrophic events including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, and prolonged drought, may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Bank.

The Bank has significant operations and a significant customer base in Utah, Texas, California and other regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, and prolonged drought. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, the Bank’s business and customers, and have posed physical risks to the Bank’s property. In addition, catastrophic events occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the Bank’s customers and in turn on the Bank. Although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place, a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the Bank’s operating results.

We could be adversely affected by failure in our internal controls.

A failure in our internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on our earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of the Bank. We continue to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to improving our controls and ensuring compliance with complex accounting standards and regulations. These efforts also include the management of controls to mitigate operational risks for programs and processes across the Bank.

We could be adversely affected by financial technology advancements and other non-traditional lending and banking sources.

The ability to successfully remain competitive is dependent upon our ability to maintain a critical technological capability and to identify and develop new, value-added products for existing and future customers. Failure to do so could impede our time to market, reduce customer product accessibility, and weaken our competitive position.

Cyber Risk

We are subject to a variety of system failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks for large financial institutions such as the Bank have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external third parties. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. The possibility of employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also presents these risks. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, misappropriation of funds, and theft, disclosure or misuse of proprietary Bank or customer data. While we have significant internal resources, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate or remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.

Model Risk

We use models in the management of the Bank. There is risk that these models are incorrect or inaccurate in various ways, which can cause us to make non-optimal decisions, and this risk causes the Bank to hold additional capital as a buffer against that risk.

We attempt to carefully develop, document, back test, and validate the models used in the management of the Bank, including, for example, models used in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk, and those used in projecting stress losses in various segments of our credit and securities portfolios, and projecting net revenue under stress. Models are inherently imperfect for a number of reasons, however, and cannot perfectly predict outcomes. Management decisions based in part on such models, therefore, can be suboptimal. In addition, in determining the Bank’s capital needs under stress testing, we attempt to specifically quantify the amounts by which model results could be incorrect, and we hold material additional amounts of capital as a buffer against this “model risk.”

Capital/Financial Reporting Risks

Internal stress testing and capital management, as well as provisions of the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, may limit our ability to increase dividends, repurchase shares of our stock, and access the capital markets.

Although we are no longer subject to the CCAR regime, we are required to submit stress tests to the OCC because the Bank has assets in excess of $10 billion, and we expect to continue to utilize stress testing as an important mechanism to inform our decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically-stressed economic conditions. The stress testing and other applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, require us to increase our capital levels, limit our dividends or other capital distributions to shareholders, modify our business strategies, or decrease our exposure to various asset classes.

Under the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the OCC. These requirements may limit our ability to respond to and take advantage of market developments.

Economic and other circumstances may require us to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to the Bank.

The Bank must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios, as required by its banking regulators, which can change depending upon general economic conditions, and the particular conditions, risk profiles and growth plans of the Bank. Compliance with capital requirements may limit the Bank’s ability to expand and has required, and may require, the Bank or its subsidiaries to raise additional capital. These uncertainties and risks, including those created by legislative and regulatory uncertainties, may increase the Bank’s cost of capital and other financing costs.

We could be adversely affected by accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory/compliance risk.

The Bank is exposed to accounting, financial reporting, and regulatory/compliance risk. The Bank provides to its customers, invests in, and uses for its own capital, funding, and risk management needs, a number of complex financial products and services. Estimates, judgments, and interpretations of complex and changing accounting and regulatory policies are required in order to provide and account for these products and services. Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and conditions. The level of regulatory/compliance oversight has been heightened in recent periods as a result of rapid changes in regulations that affect financial institutions. The administration of some of these regulations and related changes has required the Bank to comply before their formal adoption. Therefore, identification, interpretation and



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

implementation of complex and changing accounting standards as well as compliance with regulatory requirements pose an ongoing risk.

The value of our goodwill may decline in the future.

As of

December 31, 2018

, the Bank had $1 billion of goodwill that was allocated to Amegy Bank (“Amegy”), California Bank & Trust (“CB&T”) and Zions Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value, the Bank may have to take a charge related to the impairment of its goodwill. Such a charge would occur if the Bank were to experience increases in the book value of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in the fair value of equity of a reporting unit. A significant decline in the Bank’s expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the Bank’s common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate the Bank taking charges in the future related to the impairment of its goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of the appropriateness of the goodwill carrying value. If the Bank was to conclude in the future that a write-down of its goodwill is necessary, it would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s results of operations.

The Bank may not be able to utilize the significant DTA recorded on its balance sheet.

The Bank’s balance sheet includes a significant DTA. We had net DTAs of

$130 million

at

December 31, 2018

, compared with

$93 million

at

December 31, 2017

. The largest component of this asset results from additions to our ALLL for purposes of GAAP in excess of loan losses actually taken for tax purposes. Our ability to continue to record this DTA is dependent on the Bank’s ability to realize its value through net operating loss carrybacks or future projected earnings. Loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital. In addition, inclusion of this asset in determining regulatory capital is subject to certain limitations. Currently, no DTAs are disallowed for regulatory purposes at the Bank.

Legal Risks

The Dodd-Frank Act imposes significant limitations on our business activities and subjects us to increased regulation and additional costs.

The Dodd-Frank Act implementing regulations place significant additional regulatory oversight and requirements on financial institutions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act:

•

impacts the Bank’s ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;

•

impacts a number of the Bank’s business strategies;

•

requires us to incur the cost of developing substantial heightened risk management policies and infrastructure;

•

regulates the pricing of certain of our products and services and restricts the revenue that the Bank generates from certain businesses;

•

subjects the Bank to supervision by the CFPB, with very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities;

•

grants authority to state agencies to enforce state and federal laws against national banks; and

•

subjects the Bank to new and different litigation and regulatory enforcement risks;

The Bank and the entire financial services industry have incurred and will continue to incur substantial personnel, systems, consulting, and other costs in order to comply with regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act continue to be subject to rulemaking, many of the rules that have been adopted will take effect over several additional years, and many of the rules that have been adopted may be subject to interpretation and clarification, and accordingly, the impact of such regulatory changes cannot be presently determined. Individually and collectively, regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act may materially adversely affect the Bank’s and the financial services industry’s business, financial condition (including the Bank’s ability to compete effectively with less regulated financial services providers), and results of operations.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Other legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and earnings.

In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act described previously, bank regulatory agencies and international regulatory consultative bodies have proposed or are considering new regulations and requirements, some of which may be imposed without formal promulgation. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to FDIC insurance assessments.

There can be no assurance that any or all of these regulatory changes or actions will ultimately be adopted. However, if adopted, some of these proposals could adversely affect the Bank by, among other things: impacting after-tax returns earned by financial services firms in general; limiting the Bank’s ability to grow; increasing taxes or fees on some of the Bank’s funding or activities; limiting the range of products and services that the Bank could offer; and requiring the Bank to raise capital at inopportune times.

Recent political developments could result in substantial changes in tax, international trade, immigration, and other policies. The extent and timing of any such changes are uncertain, as are the potential direct and indirect impacts, whether beneficial or adverse. Regulations and laws may be modified or repealed, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries.

The ultimate impact of these proposals cannot be predicted as it is unclear which, if any, may be adopted.

We could be adversely affected by legal and governmental proceedings.

We are subject to risks associated with legal claims, litigation, and regulatory and other government proceedings. The Bank’s exposure to these proceedings has increased and may further increase as a result of stresses on customers, counterparties and others arising from the past or current economic environments, new regulations promulgated under recently adopted statutes, the creation of new examination and enforcement bodies, and increasingly aggressive enforcement and legal actions against banking organizations. Any

such

matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restrictions on our business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations, including those relating to anti-money laundering matters, have been increasing dramatically. In addition, any enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and CRA ratings, which may restrict or limit our activities.

The corporate and securities laws applicable to the Bank are not as well-developed as those applicable to a state-chartered corporation, and this may impact the ability of the Bank to effect corporate transactions in an efficient and optimal manner.

Prior to the restructuring, the corporate affairs of the Bank’s holding company were governed by Utah state law, and securities law matters were governed by the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as administered by the SEC. Each of these legal regimes is well-developed and used widely by public companies.

Post-restructuring, the Bank’s corporate affairs are governed by the National Bank Act and related regulations administered by the OCC. With respect to securities matters, the Bank is not subject to the Securities Act, but rather to OCC regulations governing securities offerings. The Bank’s common stock and certain other securities are registered or deemed registered under the Exchange Act, which vests the OCC with the power to administer and enforce certain sections of the Exchange Act applicable to banks such as the Bank (though the Bank currently makes and intends to continue to make filings required by the Exchange Act with the SEC as a “voluntary filer”). These OCC statutory and regulatory regimes have been used by publicly-traded banking organizations relatively rarely and are not as well-developed as the corporate and securities law regimes applicable to corporations. While certain specific risks associated with operating under these regimes are discussed below, unless and until these regimes are further developed and established over time, the uncertainty of how these regimes might apply to any



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

given corporate or securities matters may prevent us from effecting transactions in an efficient and optimal manner or perhaps at all.

Differences between the National Bank Act and state law requirements in respect of mergers could result in the Bank not being able to execute acquisitions as efficiently and advantageously as bank holding companies or other financial institutions.

Unlike state corporate law, the National Bank Act requires shareholder approval of all mergers between a national bank and another national or state bank and does not allow for exceptions in the case of various “minor” mergers, such as a parent company’s merger with a subsidiary or an acquirer’s merger with an unaffiliated entity in which the shares issued by the acquirer do not exceed a designated percentage. The National Bank Act and related regulations do not allow for the direct merger into a national bank of a non-affiliated non-bank.

These differences could adversely affect the Bank’s, and other banks registered under the National Bank Act, ability to efficiently consummate acquisition transactions. In addition, such differences could make the Bank less competitive as a potential acquirer in certain circumstances given that the Bank’s acquisition proposal may be conditioned on Bank shareholder approval while the Bank’s competitors’ proposals will not have such a condition.

Differences between the National Bank Act and state law could result in the Bank’s capacity to pay dividends and repurchase shares at any given time being different from the capacity that existed for Zions Bancorporation prior to the restructuring.

The regulations and limitations applicable to the Bank relating to the payment of dividends and repurchases or redemptions of outstanding common and preferred shares differ from the limitations and considerations that applied to the Bank’s holding company prior to the recent restructuring. While the Bank does not believe this change in legal restrictions resulting from the restructuring will constrain the Bank from executing any capital plans that are currently contemplated or otherwise reasonably foreseeable in the near term, there can be no assurance that the change in legal restrictions will not have an adverse effect on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase or redeem stock in the future.

Shares of common stock of a national bank are assessable and this may cause investors to view the Bank’s common stock less favorably than that of Zions Bancorporation prior to the restructuring.

The National Bank Act provides that under certain circumstances the common stock of a national bank is assessable, i.e., holders may be subject to a levy for more funds if so determined by the OCC. In contrast, the common stock of state corporations is not subject to assessment. However, the OCC has confirmed that under the applicable provisions of the National Bank Act, assessability is limited to the par value of a national bank’s stock. The Bank’s common stock has a par value of $0.001. Moreover, according to the OCC, it has not exercised its authority to levy assessments since 1933 and views the assessability authority as a mechanism for addressing capital deficiency that has long been overtaken by developments in statute and regulation, including robust capital standards, prompt corrective action requirements and supervisory and enforcement authorities requiring an institution to maintain capital at a particular level. Nonetheless, potential investors may be unfamiliar with the concept of assessment and, as a result, view the Bank less favorably as an investment.

The ability of investors to access financial and other reports filed by the Bank readily could be adversely affected if such reports were not able to be made available publicly through the SEC or a system operated by the OCC comparable to that of the SEC.

The Bank has been permitted and currently makes its Exchange Act filings as a “voluntary filer” with the SEC. There can be no assurance, however, that the OCC or SEC will continue to allow the Bank to make filings as a voluntary filer or that the OCC will develop a comparable system for making Exchange Act filings publicly available. If the Bank’s Exchange Act filings ceased to be as readily available as those of bank holding companies, investors could view the Bank less favorably.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Bank’s ability to issue securities in an optimal manner may be adversely affected by the fact that the OCC’s securities offering regulations and organizational structure are less well-developed than those of the SEC, which applied to the Bank’s holding company prior to the restructuring.

The SEC maintains a well-developed regulatory regime and well-staffed organization relating to securities offerings under or exempt from the Securities Act. For example, the SEC has developed integrated disclosure rules, which allow Exchange Act filings to be incorporated by reference into prospectuses distributed as required by the Securities Act. In addition, under the SEC’s rules seasoned issuers who are timely in their filings are permitted to use “automatic shelf registration,” allowing them to offer securities under a registration statement that is automatically effective upon filing. The OCC maintains its own securities offering regime applicable to national banks and their securities offerings, which the Bank will need to comply with in order to access the public capital markets. Similar to the SEC’s offering rules, the OCC’s regime requires that registration statements be reviewed and declared or become effective. However, given that there are currently no other nationally-charted banks whose common stock has been issued under the OCC’s securities offering regime, it is unknown at this point whether and how the OCC staff would review registration statements, and unclear whether the OCC would apply the same mechanics for automatic shelf registration filings used by SEC-filers, or how, more generally, the OCC will function as a securities regulator. Given the extent to and manner in which the Bank has accessed capital markets historically, or to which it currently contemplates accessing such markets, the Bank does not believe there will be a material adverse impact on the Bank’s ability to access capital markets effectively, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and it is possible that operating under the OCC’s securities offering regime could impede the Bank’s ability to sell securities at the most advantageous times or to achieve optimum pricing in offerings.

The Bank is subject to restrictions on permissible activities that would limit the types of business it may conduct and that may make acquisitions of other financial companies more challenging.

Under applicable laws and regulations, bank holding companies and banks are generally limited to business activities and investments that are related to banking or are financial in nature. The range of permissible financial activities is set forth in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and is more limited for banks than for bank holding company organizations. The differences relate mainly to insurance underwriting (but not insurance agency activities) and merchant banking (but not broker-dealer and investment advisory activities). Merchant banking authority is an important power for financial institutions that desire to engage in a full-scale investment banking business and can also be important for institutions that wish to engage in private equity and proprietary investment business lines. While historically the Bank’s holding company did not seek to engage in activities available only to bank holding companies under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Bank is not able to engage in these activities. Loss of the bank holding company status resulting from the restructuring will make future acquisitions by the Bank of financial institutions that have such operations more challenging.

The Bank’s common stock is not an insured deposit.

Shares of the Bank’s common stock are not a bank deposit and, therefore, losses in value are not insured by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in shares of the Bank’s common stock is inherently risky and is subject to the same market forces and investment risks that affect the price of common stock in any other company, including the possible loss of some or all principal invested.

Reputational Risk

The Bank is presented with various reputational risk issues that could stem from operational, regulatory/compliance and legal risks.

A Reputational Risk Council was established to monitor, manage and develop strategies to effectively manage reputational risk which includes, but is not limited to, addressing communication logistics, legal and regulatory issues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

GAAP to NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS

This Form 10-K presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Bank considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Bank and for presentations of Bank performance to investors. The Bank further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Bank on the same basis as that applied by management.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. The following are the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-K and a discussion of why management and investors use these non-GAAP measures.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (“ROTCE”)

– this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “average tangible common equity.” ROTCE is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the Bank’s use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information about performance because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Schedule 1

RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (NON-GAAP) – ANNUAL

Tangible Equity Ratio, Tangible Common Equity Ratio, and Tangible Book Value per Common Share

– this schedule also includes “tangible equity,” “tangible common equity,” and “tangible assets.” Tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio, and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provide additional useful information about the levels of tangible assets and tangible equity between each other and in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information about capital adequacy because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Schedule 2

TANGIBLE EQUITY (NON-GAAP) AND TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (NON-GAAP)

Efficiency Ratio

– this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” “pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”),” and “adjusted PPNR.” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedule which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Bank is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Bank’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Bank Overview

Zions Bancorporation, National Association and its subsidiaries (collectively “Zions Bancorporation, N.A.,” “the Bank,” “we,” “our,” “us”) together comprise a

$69 billion

commercial bank headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.

•

At December 31,


, the Bank had banking operations through


branches in eleven western states, with strong market share in many of the markets in which it operates. Additionally, the Bank currently has, and continues to develop its digital delivery capabilities. Revenues and profits are primarily derived from commercial customers, and the Bank also emphasizes retail banking, mortgage banking, wealth management, municipal finance, and brokerage services. The Bank is included in the Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ Financial 100 indices.

•

The Bank is consistently ranked among the best banks in the country to work with by its small and middle-market customers, as measured by the Greenwich Associates annual survey. Since the inception of the awards in 2009, only five other U.S. banks have consistently received as many Greenwich Excellence Awards as Zions Bancorporation, N.A.

•

The Bank consistently wins awards for the best bank within its geography. Examples include the best bank awards given by local newspapers, business journals, or similar publications in Nevada, Arizona, and California: Orange County (five consecutive years) and San Diego County (eight consecutive years).

•

The Bank’s objectives include:

◦

Continuing revenue growth (net interest income plus noninterest income) in excess of noninterest expense—so-called positive operating leverage—which should result in annual PPNR growth in the high-single digit rate and further improvement to the efficiency ratio;

◦

Improving profitability ratios. Improved operating efficiency coupled with low credit costs as experienced in 2018 should lead to improved profitability ratios, such as the returns on assets and equity.

◦

Maintaining or increasing capital distributions due to stronger earnings and a lower risk profile than seen in prior years.

•

The long-term strategy of the Bank to achieve these objectives includes the following:

◦

Continuing to execute on our community bank business model by doing business on a “local” basis, with significant local decision making for customer-facing elements of our business including product offerings, marketing, and pricing. We believe our scale gives us superior access to capital markets, more robust treasury management, and other product capabilities than smaller community banks. We also believe that our model provides a meaningful competitive advantage and an opportunity for growth over larger national banks whose loan and deposit products are often homogeneous. We are actively engaged in community events and charitable efforts designed to give back to the people within our communities. In 2018, we believe this local, customized approach led to a strong showing with commercial customers as reflected in the Greenwich Awards referenced earlier, as well as a loan growth rate of 4% for the year;

◦

Maintaining a strong approach to risk management, having meaningfully improved our operational, credit, and financial risk management in the past several years;

◦

Continuing to invest in a diverse team of knowledgeable and experienced bankers, known for their integrity. We are committed to building our employees’ capabilities, so they can become trusted partners of our customers and leaders in their communities; and

◦

Continuing to invest in technology. Looking forward for the next several years, we believe that digital delivery of products, including mobile banking, online banking and having a core processing system that is robust and prevents outages, is critical to remaining competitive. We have rolled out a wide range of improvements and additions to our customer interfaces including a redesigned website, mobile applications, and an upgraded treasury internet banking platform for our commercial customers.

•

During the past several years we have taken significant actions to improve the Bank’s risk profile, which include:

◦

The reduction of an above-average concentration in CRE loans. CRE loans as a percentage of total loans has declined from 35% at December 31, 2007 to 24% at December 31, 2018;

◦

Numerous changes made to the credit administration organization and processes to facilitate improved data collection on loans and monitoring of potential default and loss risk;



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

◦

The significant increase of liquidity and flexibility to reposition the securities portfolio with the purchase of moderate duration securities with limited duration extension risk; i.e., management has generally purchased securities that within the context of a rising interest rate environment would not experience interest rate related losses;

◦

The addition of five members to the Board of Directors during the past five years that have strong financial and risk management experience;

◦

The replacement and upgrade of management information and accounting systems to allow for a more complete view of the Bank’s risks and opportunities; and

◦

The ongoing evaluation and classification of all known risks into approximately sixty unique risk categories, which are regularly monitored and reported in a process that flows from line-level employees through executive management to the Board of Directors;

•

We have also taken significant actions to improve the Bank’s efficiency during the past several years, which include the streamlining or elimination of redundant or inefficient processes, and the reduction of unnecessary complexity in product types. We intend to continue improving our efficiency by creating value through the adoption of common practices, automation, and simplification of our front, middle and back-office processes.

•

We believe we have achieved even greater operating efficiencies than currently reflected in our financial statements, since our profitability has improved while at the same time investing a substantial amount to upgrade and replace core systems and applications. We announced in 2013 that we had started a project to replace our core loan and deposit banking systems (“Core Transformation Project”). We successfully implemented the first phase of the TCS BαNCS® core servicing system in mid-2017, replacing our consumer lending system. The second phase of the Core Transformation Project, which replaces the Bank’s primary commercial lending systems, was deployed in the February of 2019 and we are in the process of finalizing the full implementation. The replacement of the deposit system is expected to be the third phase of the Core Transformation Project, and is still in the preliminary stages of development. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had $196 million of capitalized expenses associated with the Core Transformation Project. BαNCS® is a real time, parameter-driven servicing system that will provide long-term benefits to the Bank by improving accessibility and functionality, allowing our bankers to better serve customers.

•

As part of our ongoing simplification and efficiency efforts, on September 30, 2018, the Bank completed the merger of Zions Bancorporation, its former bank holding company, with, and into, the Bank formerly known as ZB, N.A., in order to further reduce organizational complexity. The restructuring eliminated the bank holding company structure and associated regulatory framework, and resulted in ZB, N.A. being renamed Zions Bancorporation, National Association and becoming the top-level entity within our corporate structure. The merger eliminates duplicative regulatory efforts, leaving the OCC as the Bank’s primary regulator. As a result of the merger and the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s action on September 12, 2018, the Bank is no longer considered a systemically important financial institution under the Dodd-Frank Act. See “Capital Management” on page


for more information regarding the merger. In December 2015, the Bank consolidated its various banking charters into a single charter.

•

In May 2018, the Crapo Bill was signed into law, reducing regulatory requirements for many banking institutions and exempting the Bank from the capital planning actions as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

•

With the improvement in profitability and our risk profile, the Bank’s capital stress test results have markedly improved during the past few years, and as such, we have increased the return on- and of-capital to shareholders, including increasing the common dividend from $0.16 per share in 2014 to $1.04 per share in 2018. Additionally, we repurchased $670 million of common stock during 2018, which is 7% of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We believe we are carrying excess capital, informed primarily by our stress test results, and have indicated that we intend to reduce our capital ratios to levels more consistent with our significantly reduced risk profile. The magnitude, timing and form of capital return will be determined by the Board.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Summary

The Bank reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for


of

$850 million

or

$4.08

per diluted common share compared with

$550 million

or

$2.60

per diluted common share for


. Although a reduction in the statutory tax rate contributed significantly to the improved earnings, adjusted PPNR increased by $141 million, or 14%, to $1.1 billion. The increase in adjusted PPNR was primarily the result of increased interest income due to loan growth and continued expense control. Additionally, net income was positively impacted by improving credit quality, as discussed in more detail below. The Bank’s efficiency ratio improved to 59.6% in 2018 from 62.3% in 2017. We expect to achieve a high single-digit rate of growth in PPNR during the next several years without assuming the benefit of further benchmark interest rate increases and continue to strive for improvements to our efficiency ratio going forward.

The Bank’s net interest margin (“NIM”) expanded 16 basis points (“bps”) for the full year of 2018 versus 2017, which was largely attributable to the favorable effects of higher interest rates on our moderately “asset sensitive” balance sheet – where asset yields repriced faster and/or to a greater degree than liabilities (see Schedule 6).

Asset quality improved considerably in 2018, reflecting strong improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio and generally stable to moderate improvements in other loan portfolios. Relative to 2017, total criticized, classified, and nonaccrual loans declined by 37%, 38%, and 39%, respectively. Net loan recoveries, expressed as a percentage of average loans held for investment, improved to net recoveries of 0.04% in 2018 from net charge-offs of 0.17% in 2017, largely the result of loan recoveries in the oil and gas portfolio.

Specifically for 2018 relative to 2017, the improved financial performance reflects:

•

Moderate net interest income growth resulting from loan growth and a generally stable securities portfolio, combined with the benefit of rising benchmark interest rates on a balance sheet that consists of assets that generally reprice faster and to a greater degree than the liabilities.

•

Modest adjusted noninterest income growth due to continued focus on this source of revenue; we experienced notable successes such as generating strong growth in trust and wealth management income, increasing loan syndication arrangement fees, and arranging interest rate hedges for our loan customers.

•

A slight increase in noninterest expense while we remain focused on expense controls and continue to invest in technology and simplification initiatives. We delivered on our commitment to limit adjusted noninterest expense growth in 2018 to increase only slightly relative to our 2017 results. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $31 million in 2018, or 2%, to $1.7 billion in 2018.

•

A decline in the provision for credit losses from

$17 million

in 2017, to

$(40) million

in 2018 as the credit quality of loans improved.

Net earnings applicable to common shareholders increased by 55% over the prior year, and earnings per diluted share increased by 57%, a slightly stronger rate of growth than net earnings due to the repurchase of 12.9 million shares of Bank common stock during 2018.

Areas Experiencing Challenges in


Although loan growth was generally consistent with the targeted levels we had established for 2018, we experienced increased competition during the year. Some of this competition came from non-bank financial institutions such as debt funds, debt capital markets, and covenant-light structures. Additionally, some larger customers elected to refinance loans through the issuance of debt in the capital markets – an option that is not readily available to most of our customers.

Loan growth of $1.9 billion, or 4%, exceeded deposit growth of $1.5 billion, or 3%, in 2018. Consequently, we relied more on wholesale funding to finance incremental balance sheet growth, increasing our funding cost.

Noninterest income from customer-related fees increased

3%

in 2018 from the prior year period, which was less than the targeted growth goal. We experienced strength in corporate investment services and wealth management



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

income, loan syndication fees and bankcard fees. This growth was partially offset by declines in mortgage-related fees and deposit service charges.

Focus for 2019

In 2019, we are focused on the ongoing initiatives related to Bank profitability and returns on- and of-equity. Major areas of emphasis include the following:

•

Achieve positive operating leverage

◦

Achieve broad-based loan growth (i.e. low- to mid-single digit growth rate) within acceptable concentration limits

◦

Achieve similar or improve upon growth rates in noninterest income, emphasizing customer-related fee income

◦

Achieve greater sales volumes and revenue growth through enhanced use of data

◦

Manage noninterest expense growth linked to revenue growth, profitability and digital delivery strategies

•

Target high single-digit annual percentage growth rate for PPNR

•

Demonstrate reduced volatility in financial performance than previously experienced

•

Implement technology upgrade and digital strategies, automation and simplification of front, middle and bank office processes

•

Increase the return on- and of- capital

◦

Maintain top quartile credit risk profile and superior risk management posture leading to increasing returns of capital

◦

Moderately increase financial leverage through the reduction of surplus common equity as informed by stress testing

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities and is more than three-quarters of our revenue. Net interest income is derived from both the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the net yield earned on the assets and paid on the liabilities.

Net interest income improved by

$165 million

during 2018 compared with 2017 to

$2.2 billion

, an increase of 8%. For


, taxable-equivalent net interest income was

$2.3 billion

, compared with

$2.1 billion

and

$1.9 billion

, in


and


, respectively. The tax rate used for calculating all taxable-equivalent adjustments was

21%

for 2018 and

35%

for all prior periods. The increase over 2017, and the previous increase over 2016, were driven by several factors, including average loan growth, noninterest-bearing deposit stability, disciplined deposit pricing and increases in benchmark interest rates. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was further impacted by a larger average securities portfolio balance. We are not assuming any further increases in benchmark rates in our forecasts. However, because of loan growth and the benefit of our noninterest-bearing deposits, we expect net interest income to increase at a moderate pace in 2019 when compared with 2018.

Net Interest Margin and Interest Rate Spreads in


vs.


The NIM was

3.61%

and

3.45%

for


and


, respectively. When comparing 2018 with 2017, changes in asset mix resulted in higher average loans, lower average securities and money market investments, and higher average interest-bearing deposits and wholesale borrowings balances to fund overall balance sheet growth. A significant source of NIM expansion is the increasing value of noninterest-bearing demand deposit accounts in the rising interest rate environment. Expansion of NIM reflects a higher loan yield with only a moderate increase in funding costs. Funding balance sheet growth with wholesale borrowings reduced spreads and negatively impacted NIM, although it was accretive to net interest income. The NIM was also positively impacted by increases in the federal funds target rate during 2018. Average interest-earning assets increased $1.6 billion from 2017, with average rates improving 35 bps. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.5 billion and average rates also increased 35 bps over the same period.

The average balance of our investment securities portfolio decreased

$0.1 billion

, while year-end balances decreased $0.5 billion. Our average lending portfolio increased

$1.9 billion

to

$45.4 billion

, an increase of

4%

. The net earning asset growth was funded through a mix of deposits and wholesale borrowings.

Interest expense increased

$124 million

compared to 2017 results, attributable to both an increase in the cost and quantity of deposits and wholesale funding. Interest expense on deposits increased

$76 million

on

$29.4 billion

of average interest-bearing deposits.

The increase in the average loan portfolio was due to growth in 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal lending. Yields on average balances increased by 43 bps, 45 bps, and 20 bps in the commercial, CRE and consumer portfolios, respectively. Much of the consumer growth was in consumer 1-4 family residential, where our yields are generally lower than on commercial loans. The federal funds target rate increased nine times beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, which has had a positive impact on NIM and spreads, as our earning assets generally reprice more quickly than our funding sources. A portion of our variable-rate loans were not affected by these changes primarily due to longer reset frequency, or because a substantial portion of our earning assets are tied to longer-term rates indices, which rates were impacted by a relatively flat yield curve for much of 2018. Additionally, NIM benefited from FDIC-supported loans by 1 and 3 bps in 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect moderate to strong growth in 1-4 family, municipal, commercial and industrial, and owner-occupied loans and stable-to-moderate growth in CRE and oil and gas-related loans.

Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits provided us with low-cost funding and comprised

45%

of average total deposits, which totaled

$53.2 billion

in 2018, compared with

46%

of average total deposits, which totaled

$52.2 billion

, for 2017. Average interest-bearing deposits increased

3%

in 2018, compared with 2017. Over the past 12 months the Federal Reserve has increased the overnight benchmark federal funds rate by 100 bps, while the rate



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

paid on the Bank’s interest-bearing deposits increased 25 bps, implying a deposit beta of 25%. We have been selectively increasing deposit pricing in certain markets and with certain clients, but we have not generally experienced significant pressure to broadly increase deposit rates. Although we consider a wide variety of sources when determining our funding needs, we benefit from access to deposits from a significant number of small to mid-sized business customers, which provide us with a low cost of funds and have a positive impact on our NIM. Including wholesale borrowings, the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 35 bps.

The average balance of long-term debt increased

$118 million

compared with 2017, while the average rate decreased 58 bps. During the third quarter 2018, the Bank issued a $500 million senior note with an interest rate of 3.5%. Overall interest expense on long-term debt increased

$4 million

. The Bank has used short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings to fund some of its balance sheet growth during the past couple of years. Average short-term debt grew

$0.5 billion

and the rate paid increased 88 bps. Further changes in short-term borrowings will be driven by balancing changes in deposits and loans as we do not foresee significant increases in investment security balances.

The spread on average interest-bearing funds was

3.28%

in 2018 and

3.27%

in 2017, respectively. The spread on average interest-bearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the NIM.

Interest rate spreads and margin are impacted by the mix of assets we hold, the composition of our loan and securities portfolios and the type of funding used. We expect the yield of the loan portfolio to increase somewhat due to the effects of rising interest rates in 2018, partially offset by a continued modest change in the mix of the portfolio (increasing concentration in lower-yielding residential mortgages), as well as reduced income from higher-yielding loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009.

Our estimates of the Bank’s interest rate risk position are highly dependent upon a number of assumptions regarding the repricing behavior of various deposit and loan types in response to changes in both short-term and long-term interest rates, balance sheet composition, and other modeling assumptions, as well as the actions of competitors and customers in response to those changes. Although the federal funds target rate has increased 225 bps since the fourth quarter of 2015, we have not experienced significant migration of our noninterest-bearing deposits which we attribute to the operating nature of many of our deposit accounts.

Net Interest Margin and Interest Rate Spreads in 2017 vs. 2016

The NIM was 3.45% and 3.37% for


and


, respectively. Compared with 2016, changes in asset mix resulted in higher securities and loan balances, lower balances in money market investments, and higher balances of wholesale borrowings to fund overall balance sheet growth. Moving funds from money market investments to loans and securities had a positive impact on NIM. The NIM was also positively impacted by several increases in short-term interest rates. Average interest-earning assets increased $4.7 billion from 2016, with average rates improving 14 bps. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.6 billion and average rates increased 8 bps over the same period.

The average loan portfolio increased $1.4 billion, or 3% from 2016, with the majority of growth coming from 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial, and municipal lending. Yields on average balances increased overall, buoyed by increases of 16 bps and 26 bps in the commercial and CRE portfolios, respectively; yields on average consumer balances were relatively flat during 2017. Additionally, NIM benefited from FDIC-supported loans by approximately 3 bps and 4 bps in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Average available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities balances increased $5.4 billion during 2017 and yields were also up 17 bps due to the effect of rising interest rates on variable-rate securities, moderation in the amount of prepayments on agency-guaranteed, mortgage-backed securities, and investment in products providing a higher yield than the



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

average portfolio.

The purchases were funded by using lower-yielding average money market investments, which were reduced by $2.1 billion, and wholesale bo

rrowing from the FHLB.

Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits provided us with low-cost funding and comprised 45.6% of average total deposits, which totaled $52.2 billion in 2017, compared with 44.4% of average total deposits, which totaled $50.6 billion, for 2016. Average interest-bearing deposits increased only 1% in 2017, compared with 2016. The average balance of long-term debt decreased $286 million compared with 2016 and the average rate increased 61 bps in the current year while interest expense decreased $13 million from 2016. The rate increased because the remaining debt was at a higher average rate than the rate on debt that matured and was available to be called.

The spread on average interest-bearing funds was 3.27% and 3.23% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The spread on average interest-bearing funds for these periods was affected by the same factors that had an impact on the NIM. Refer to the “Liquidity Risk Management” section beginning on page

analyzes the year-to-year changes in net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis for the years indicated. For purposes of calculating the yields in these schedules, the average loan balances also include the principal amounts of nonaccrual and restructured loans. However, interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only to the extent that cash payments have been received and not applied to principal reductions. In addition, interest on restructured loans is generally accrued at reduced rates.

ANALYSIS OF INTEREST CHANGES DUE TO VOLUME AND RATE


Taxable-equivalent rates used where applicable.


Net of unearned income and fees, net of related costs. Loans include nonaccrual and restructured loans.

In the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate, changes due to the volume/rate variance are allocated to volume with the following exceptions: when volume and rate both increase, the variance is allocated proportionately to both volume and rate; when the rate increases and volume decreases, the variance is allocated to rate.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that, in our judgment, is required to maintain the ALLL at an adequate level based on the inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is used to maintain the reserve for unfunded lending commitments (“RULC”) at an adequate level based on the inherent risks associated with such commitments. In determining adequate levels of the ALLL and RULC, we perform periodic evaluations of our various loan portfolios, the levels of actual charge-offs, credit quality trends, and external factors. See Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

“Credit Risk Management” on page


for more information on how we determine the appropriate level for the ALLL and the RULC.

The provision for loan losses was

$(39) million

in 2018, compared with

$24 million

in 2017. Credit quality was strong throughout 2018, with continued significant improvement in the oil and gas-related portfolio. Classified and nonaccrual loans in the total portfolio declined by $435 million and $162 million, respectively. Net recoveries totaled $16 million in 2018, compared with $73 million in net charge-offs in 2017. These improvements in both credit quality and net charge-offs resulted in the lower provision.

The provision for unfunded lending commitments was

$(1) million

in 2018, compared with

$(7) million

in 2017. The change in the provision in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to increased unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by credit quality improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio. The negative provision in 2017 was primarily due to improved credit quality assessments related to obligations for credits outside the oil and gas-related portfolio, along with declining oil and gas-related exposure. From quarter to quarter, the provision for unfunded lending commitments may be subject to sizable fluctuations due to changes in the timing and volume of loan commitments, originations, fundings, and changes in credit quality.

The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”), which is the combination of both the ALLL and the RULC, decreased by $24 million during 2018. Strong credit quality in 2018, highlighted by improvement in the oil and gas-related portfolio, was responsible for much of this reduction. Further, increasing non-oil and gas-related commercial and industrial and 1-4 family residential mortgage exposure, also improved the risk profile of the total portfolio.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income represents revenues we earn for products and services that have no associated interest rate or yield. Noninterest income accounted for 18% and 20% of total revenue during 2018 and 2017, respectively. For


, noninterest income was

$552 million

compared with

$544 million

in


and

$516 million

in


.

During 2018, we experienced strength in corporate investment services and wealth management income, loan syndication fees, bankcard fees and merchant account fees while experiencing declines in deposit-related service charges and mortgage-related fees. The improvement in corporate investment services income was primarily due to increases in the revenue share received from the higher balances in money market mutual funds. Rising interest rates resulted in improved returns for money market mutual funds, thus driving the increase in balances. Deposit service charge income experienced slight resistance due, in part, to rising interest rates as discussed below. Rising interest rates also adversely impacted mortgage banking activity.

We believe a subtotal of customer-related fees provides a better view of income over which we have more direct control. It excludes items such as dividends, insurance-related income, mark-to-market adjustments on certain derivatives, and securities gains and losses.

Schedule 7

presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest income for the past three years.

Schedule 7

NONINTEREST INCOME

Service charges and fees on deposit accounts decreased by $5 million, or 3%, during 2018 and has been static or slightly decreasing for the last several years. A primary driver of the decline in service charges and fees was softening of high transaction volume customers. A secondary driver of this decline could be attributed to rising interest rates, which may influence increases in the earning credit rate due to customer expectations. The earnings credit rate (ECR) is a daily calculation of soft dollar credit that a bank pays on customer’s noninterest-bearing deposits on Account Analysis. This credit can be used to offset service charges on a customer’s analyzed account. As the ECR increases, customers offset more of their deposit service charges, thus the potential softening in noninterest income.

Other service charges, commissions and fees, which are comprised of automated teller machine (“ATM”) fees, insurance commissions, bankcard merchant fees, debit and credit card interchange fees, cash management fees, and other miscellaneous fees, increased by

$11 million

, or 5%, compared with 2017. The increase relates mainly to higher credit card interchange fees and exchange and other fees. In 2017 other service charges, commissions and fees increased by $9 million compared with 2016. The increase was primarily a result of the same items mentioned previously.

Wealth management and trust income increased by

$9 million

, or 21%. The change was due to trust income, with improvement in both corporate and personal trust revenue due to platform and product simplifications. Wealth management and trust income increased $5 million between 2017 and 2016 for the same reasons.

Securities gains, net, decreased $13 million during 2018 as a result of $13 million of increases in the market value of the Bank’s Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments in 2017 that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in 2018. Securities gains, net in 2017 increased from 2016 as a result of higher increases in the market values of the Bank’s SBIC investments.

Dividends and other investment income increased $16 million between 2017 and 2016, primarily due to $14 million of gains across many of our cost and equity method investments.

Loan sales and servicing income decreased $10 million between 2017 and 2016. During 2017, we ceased selling servicing-released mortgage loans to Freddie Mac, and therefore no longer received the associated servicing premiums for doing so, which decreased income by $11 million. In general, servicing income increased slightly in 2017. We also had particularly large valuation gains during 2016 on agricultural loan servicing assets accounted for at fair value, which did not repeat to the same extent in 2017.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Noninterest Expense

As mentioned previously, we delivered on our commitment to limit adjusted noninterest expense growth in 2018 to increase only slightly relative to our 2017 results. Both noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense were $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $1.6 billion in both 2017 and 2016. Noninterest expense increased $29 million, or 2%, and adjusted noninterest expense increased $31 million, also 2%, in 2018. (see “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” on page


for more information regarding the calculation of adjusted noninterest expense).

We have developed a culture that continually seeks to streamline and make more simple and efficient the processes required to operate. To this end, in 2018 we successfully completed the merger of the holding company with and into the bank subsidiary. The consolidation of our seven bank charters at the end of 2015 almost entirely eliminated the need for the holding company; the consolidation of the holding company into the bank reduced duplicative regulatory examinations and certain regulatory requirements. The Bank remains focused on expense control efforts, while continuing to invest in technology initiatives.

Schedule 8

presents a comparison of the major components of noninterest expense for the past three years.

Schedule 8

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Salaries and employee benefits increased by $64 million, or 6%, in 2018, compared with 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased primarily due to a $29 million increase in base salaries resulting from salary increases related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, merit increases and increased headcount, and a $19 million increase in incentive compensation, of which $7 million relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The remaining $16 million increase was primarily a result of an $8 million increase in the Bank’s medical plans and a $7 million increase in the Bank’s contribution to the employee 401(k) plan, as a result of improved financial performance, including the profit sharing contribution which increased to 2.5% of eligible compensation in 2018 from 1.75% in 2017. Our investment in major systems projects has led to headcount increases in more highly compensated roles.

Salaries and employee benefits increased by $28 million, or 3%, in 2017, compared with 2016. Base salaries were up in 2017, as employee salary expense rose roughly in line with inflation. Employee bonuses were up, partially due to lower incentive compensation for management in 2016 and larger commission expense in 2017. Benefits expense increased $11 million, or 8%, in 2017, primarily due to higher costs in the Bank’s medical plans and an increase in profit sharing expense.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Schedule 9

SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Occupancy expense was up

$3 million

, or 2%, in 2018 primarily due to increased property taxes and depreciation expense, partially offset by increased rental income. Occupancy expense was up $4 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. We placed a newly constructed office building into operation during the first quarter of 2017 and increased rental income from higher occupancies of leased space began in the latter-half of 2017 and 2018.

Furniture and equipment expense decreased $4 million, or 3%, in 2018 primarily from decreased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased amortization of capitalized software. Furniture and equipment expense increased $5 million in 2017 mainly due to increased amortization expense. During 2017, we successfully implemented the first phase of the TCS BαNCS

®

core servicing system. The second phase of the Core Transformation Project, which replaces the Bank’s primary commercial lending systems, was deployed in the February of 2019 and we are in the process of finalizing the full implementation.

The provision for unfunded lending commitments was $(1) million in 2018 compared to $(7) million in 2017 and $(10) million in 2016, and is discussed previously in the Provision for Credit Losses section.

Professional and legal services decreased $5 million from 2017 to $52 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily a result of lower consulting fees related to our simplification and technology initiatives.

FDIC premiums were

$50 million

,

$53 million

, and

$40 million

, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 is primarily due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge for large banks because the required Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio has been met. The increase during 2017 when compared to 2016 was due to higher deposit bases and the FDIC’s increase in deposit insurance assessments that occurred in the third quarter of 2016. This increase during 2017 was somewhat offset by a reduction in the Bank’s overall rate resulting from the consolidation of the individual bank charters.

Other noninterest expense was

$197 million

in 2018, compared with

$231 million

in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the one-time $12 million charitable contribution made at the end of 2017 and a decrease in employee and operational expenses resulting from the Bank’s simplification and efficiencies initiatives.

In October 2018, the Bank decided to terminate its pension plan subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approval. Completion of this termination is expected in early 2020. Plan participant benefits will not be disadvantaged because of this decision. At the time of final liquidation additional noninterest expense will be recognized for pension amounts remaining in other comprehensive income (“OCI”), as well as expense related to purchasing annuities for participants who elect that distribution method. As of December 31, 2018, the pension plan was overfunded by

$19 million

, compared with

$14 million

as of December 31, 2017. The qualified pension OCI balance at December 31, 2018 was a

$27 million

loss before adjusting for tax effects. The expense related to purchasing annuities is highly dependent on individual participant elections between lump-sum distribution options



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

and an annuity option, in addition to market competitiveness in the annuity bid process. The current estimate of this expense is $5 million to $15 million, and is subject to change depending upon the previously mentioned factors.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense was

$259 million

in


,

$344 million

in


, and

$236 million

in


. Our effective income tax rates were 22.7% in


, 36.8% in


, and 33.5% in


. The income tax rates for all tax years were reduced by nontaxable municipal interest income and nontaxable income from certain bank-owned life insurance. The income tax rate for 2018 was positively impacted by the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was effective January 1, 2018. This rate benefit was partially reduced by the non-deductibility of FDIC premiums, certain executive compensation and other fringe benefits as enacted by the new tax law.

The tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by a one-time $18 million benefit to tax expense related to the reevaluation of state tax positions, an excess tax benefit of $9 million from the implementation of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, and an estimated net DTA write-off of $47 million through income tax expense associated with the decrease in the federal income tax rate from the passage of new legislation.

The Bank continued to invest in technology initiatives and increased investment in municipal securities during 2018, 2017, and 2016, generating tax credits and nontaxable income that benefited the tax rate each year.

We had a net DTA balance of $130 million at

December 31, 2018

, compared with $93 million at

December 31, 2017

. The increase in the net DTA resulted primarily from the increase in accrued compensation and unrealized losses in OCI related to securities, and the decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to the deferred gain on a prior period debt exchange. Net charge-offs exceeding the provision for loan losses, an increase in deferred loan fees and accelerated tax deductions on certain technology initiatives and depreciable property during 2018 offset some of the overall increase in DTA. We did not record any additional valuation allowance for GAAP purposes as of December 31, 2018.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

We manage our operations and prepare management reports and other information with a primary focus on geographical area. Our banking operations are managed under their own individual brand names, including Zions Bank, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, National Bank of Arizona (“NBAZ”), Nevada State Bank (“NSB”), Vectra Bank Colorado (“Vectra”), and The Commerce Bank of Washington (“TCBW”). Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographical structure. Most of the lending and other decisions affecting customers are made at the local level. The accounting policies of the individual segments are the same as those of the Bank. We allocate the cost of centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated or actual usage of those services. We also use an internal Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) allocation system to report results of operations for business segments. This process is continually refined. The operating segment identified as “Other” includes certain nonbank financial service subsidiaries, centralized back-office functions, and eliminations of transactions between segments. See Note

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Interest-Earning Assets

Interest-earning assets are those assets that have interest rates or yields associated with them. One of our goals is to maintain a high level of interest-earning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum. Interest-earning assets consist of money market investments, securities, loans, and leases.

Schedule 5

,

which we referenced in our discussion of net interest income, includes the average balances of our interest-earning assets, the amount of revenue generated by them, and their respective yields. Another goal is to maintain a higher-yielding mix of interest-earning assets, such as loans, relative to lower-yielding assets, while maintaining adequate levels of highly liquid assets. As a result of this goal we redeployed funds from lower-yielding money market investments, in addition to using wholesale borrowings, to purchase agency securities.

Average interest-earning assets were

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Loan portfolio growth during 2018 was widespread across loan products and geographies with particular strength in

consumer 1-4 family residential, commercial and industrial, municipal, and commercial owner-occupied loans. The growth in the loan portfolio was primarily at CB&T and Zions Bank.

Of the significant increases within the portfolio, consumer 1-4 family residential loans increased $514 million, commercial and industrial loans increased $510 million, municipal loans increased $390 million, and commercial owner-occupied loans increased $373 million. The impact of these increases was partially offset by a decrease of $164 million in our CRE term portfolio.

We expect moderate total loan and lease growth during 2019, primarily in consumer 1-4 family residential, municipal, commercial and industrial, and commercial owner-occupied (non-NRE). We expect stable to moderate growth in oil and gas and CRE loans, partially offset by a moderate decline in the National Real Estate (“NRE”) loan portfolio.

Loans serviced for the benefit of others increased to $3.9 billion during 2018 from $3.7 billion in 2017.

Other Noninterest-Bearing Investments

During 2018, the Bank increased its short-term borrowings with the FHLB by $900 million. This increase required a further investment in FHLB activity stock, which consequently increased by $36 million during the year. Aside from this increase, other noninterest-bearing investments remained relatively stable as set forth in the following schedule.

RISK ELEMENTS

Since risk is inherent in substantially all of the Bank’s operations, management of risk is an integral part of its operations and is also a key determinant of its overall performance. The Board of Directors has appointed a Risk Oversight Committee (“ROC”) that consists of appointed Board members who oversee the Bank’s risk management processes. The ROC meets on a regular basis to monitor and review Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) policies and activities. As required by its charter, the ROC performs oversight for various ERM activities and approves ERM policies and activities as detailed in the ROC charter.

Management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which the Bank’s operations are exposed, including credit, interest rate and market, liquidity, and operational risks. These risks are overseen by the various management committees of which the Enterprise Risk Management Committee is the focal point for the monitoring and review of enterprise risk.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-related contract. Credit risk arises primarily from our lending activities, as well as from off-balance sheet credit instruments.

The Board of Directors, through the ROC, is responsible for approving the overall credit policies relating to the management of the credit risk of the Bank. In addition, the ROC oversees and monitors adherence to key credit policies and the credit risk appetite as defined in the Risk Appetite Framework. Additionally, the Board has established the Credit Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and consisting of members of management, to which it has delegated the responsibility for managing credit risk for the Bank and approving changes to the Bank’s credit policies.

Centralized oversight of credit risk is provided through credit policies, credit risk management, and credit examination functions. Our credit policies place emphasis on strong underwriting standards and early detection of potential problem credits in order to develop and implement action plans on a timely basis to mitigate any potential losses. These formal credit policies and procedures provide the Bank with a framework for consistent underwriting and a basis for sound credit decisions at the local banking affiliate level. Credit examinations related to the ACL are reported to both the Audit Committee and the ROC.

Our credit risk management function is separate from the lending function and strengthens control over, and the independent evaluation of, credit activities. In addition, we have a well-defined set of standards for evaluating our loan portfolio, and we utilize a comprehensive loan risk-grading system to determine the risk potential in the portfolio. Furthermore, the internal credit examination department, which is independent of the lending function, periodically conducts examinations of the Bank’s lending departments and credit activities. These examinations are designed to review credit quality, adequacy of documentation, appropriate loan risk-grading administration, and compliance with credit policies. New, expanded, or modified products and services, as well as new lines of business, are approved by the New Initiative Review Committee.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our credit risk management strategy includes diversification of our loan portfolio. We attempt to avoid the risk of an undue concentration of credits in a particular collateral type or with an individual customer or counterparty. Generally, our loan portfolio is well diversified; however, due to the nature of our geographical footprint, there are certain significant concentrations primarily in CRE and oil and gas-related lending. We have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on leveraged lending, municipal lending, oil and gas-related lending, and various types of CRE lending, particularly construction and land development lending. All of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary. The recent growth in construction and land development loan commitments is within the established concentration limits. Our business activity is primarily with customers located within the geographical footprint of our banking affiliates.

As we continue to monitor our concentration risk, the composition of our loan portfolio has slightly changed. Total commercial loans were 52% of the total portfolio, compared with 51% at December 31, 2017. CRE loans declined to 24% of the total portfolio, compared with 25% at December 31, 2017. Consumer loans remained at 24% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Approximately

13%

of the CRE term loans consist of mini-perm loans as of

December 31, 2018

. For such loans, construction has been completed and the project has stabilized to a level that supports the granting of a mini-perm loan in accordance with our underwriting standards. Mini-perm loans generally have initial maturities of three to five years. The remaining

87%

of CRE loans are term loans with initial maturities generally of 5 to 20 years. The stabilization criteria for a project to qualify for a term loan differ by product type and include criteria related to the cash flow generated by the project, loan-to-value ratio, and occupancy rates.

Approximately

$134 million

, or

9%

, of the commercial construction and land development portfolio at

December 31, 2018

consists of acquisition and development loans. Most of these acquisition and development loans are secured by specific retail, apartment, office, or other projects.

Underwriting on commercial properties is primarily based on the economic viability of the project with heavy consideration given to the creditworthiness and experience of the sponsor. We generally require that the owner’s equity be injected prior to bank advances. Remargining requirements (required equity infusions upon a decline in value or cash flow of the collateral) are often included in the loan agreement along with guarantees of the sponsor. Recognizing that debt is paid via cash flow, the projected cash flows of the project are critical in the underwriting because these determine the ultimate value of the property and its ability to service debt. Therefore, in most projects (with the exception of multifamily and hospitality construction projects), we require substantial pre-leasing/leasing in our underwriting and we generally require a minimum projected stabilized debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 or higher, depending on the project asset class.

Within the residential construction and development sector, many of the requirements previously mentioned, such as creditworthiness and experience of the developer, up-front injection of the developer’s equity, principal curtailment requirements, and the viability of the project are also important in underwriting a residential development loan. Significant consideration is given to the forecasted market acceptance of the product, location, strength of the developer, and the ability of the developer to stay within budget. Progress inspections by qualified independent inspectors are routinely performed before disbursements are made.

Real estate appraisals are ordered in accordance with regulatory guidelines and are validated independently of the loan officer and the borrower, generally by our internal appraisal review function, which is staffed by licensed appraisers. In some cases, reports from automated valuation services are used or internal evaluations are performed. A new appraisal or evaluation is required when a loan deteriorates to a certain level of credit weakness.

Advance rates (i.e., loan commitments) will vary based on the viability of the project and the creditworthiness of the sponsor, but our guidelines generally limit advances to 50% for raw land, 65% for land development, 65% for finished commercial lots, 75% for finished residential lots, 80% for pre-sold homes, 75% for models and homes not under contract, and 75% for commercial properties. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.

Loan agreements require regular financial information on the project and the sponsor in addition to lease schedules, rent rolls and, on construction projects, independent progress inspection reports. The receipt of this financial information is monitored, and calculations are made to determine adherence to the covenants set forth in the loan agreement.

The existence of a guarantee that improves the likelihood of repayment is taken into consideration when analyzing CRE loans for impairment. If the support of the guarantor is quantifiable and documented, it is included in the potential cash flows and liquidity available for debt repayment, and our impairment methodology takes this repayment source into consideration.

When we modify or extend a loan, we also give consideration to whether the borrower is in financial difficulty, and whether we have granted a concession. In determining if an interest rate concession has been granted, we consider whether the interest rate on the modified loan is equivalent to current market rates for new debt with similar risk characteristics. If the rate in the modification is less than current market rates, it may indicate that a concession was granted and impairment exists. However, if additional collateral is obtained, or if a guarantor exists who has the



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

capacity and willingness to support the loan on an extended basis, we also consider the nature and amount of the additional collateral and guarantees in the ultimate determination of whether a concession has been granted.

In general, we obtain and consider updated financial information for the guarantor as part of our determination to extend a loan. The quality and frequency of financial reporting collected and analyzed varies depending on the contractual requirements for reporting, the size of the transaction, and the strength of the guarantor.

Complete underwriting of the guarantor includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the guarantor’s current financial statements, leverage, liquidity, global cash flow, global debt service coverage, contingent liabilities, etc. The assessment also includes a qualitative analysis of the guarantor’s willingness to perform in the event of a problem and demonstrated history of performing in similar situations. Additional analysis may include personal financial statements, tax returns, liquidity (brokerage) confirmations, and other reports, as appropriate.

A qualitative assessment is performed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate the guarantor’s experience, performance track record, reputation, and willingness to work with us. We also utilize market information sources, rating, and scoring services in our assessment. This qualitative analysis coupled with a documented quantitative ability to support the loan may result in a higher-quality internal loan grade, which may reduce the level of allowance we estimate. Previous documentation of the guarantor’s financial ability to support the loan is discounted if there is any indication of a lack of willingness by the guarantor to support the loan.

In the event of default, we evaluate the pursuit of any and all appropriate potential sources of repayment, which may come from multiple sources, including the guarantee. A number of factors are considered when deciding whether or not to pursue a guarantor, including, but not limited to, the value and liquidity of other sources of repayment (collateral), the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor, possible statutory limitations (e.g., single action rule on real estate) and the overall cost of pursuing a guarantee compared with the ultimate amount we may be able to recover. In other instances, the guarantor may voluntarily support a loan without any formal pursuit of remedies.

A decrease in oil and gas prices could potentially produce an adverse impact on our CRE loan portfolio within Texas. However, based upon generally strong equity and cash flow coverage levels, and sponsor support for the various properties, we do not expect a material amount of losses within this portfolio in 2019. Our largest CRE credit exposures in Texas are to the multi-family, office, and retail sectors. At

Consumer Loans

We have mainly been an originator of first and second mortgages, generally considered to be of prime quality. We generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell “conforming” fixed-rate loans to third parties, including Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, for which we make representations and warranties that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards.

We are engaged in Home Equity Credit Line (“HECL”) lending. At

December 31, 2018

and

billion, respectively. The following schedule describes the composition of our HECL portfolio by lien status.

Schedule 20

HECL PORTFOLIO BY LIEN STATUS



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

At

December 31, 2018

, loans representing less than 1% of the outstanding balance in the HECL portfolio were estimated to have combined loan-to-value ratios (“CLTV”) above 100%. An estimated CLTV ratio is the ratio of our loan plus any prior lien amounts divided by the estimated current collateral-value. At origination, underwriting standards for the HECL portfolio generally include a maximum 80% CLTV with high credit scores at origination.

Approximately

89%

of our HECL portfolio is still in the draw period, and approximately

18%

of those loans are scheduled to begin amortizing within the next five years. We regularly analyze the risk of borrower default in the event of a loan becoming fully amortizing and the risk of higher interest rates. The analysis indicates that the risk of loss from this factor is minimal in the current economic environment. The ratio of net charge-offs to average balances at year-end 2018 and 2017 for the HECL portfolio was

decreased to

$252

million from

, primarily in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. However, nonaccrual loans slightly increased in the commercial real estate term loan portfolio. The largest total decrease in nonaccrual loans occurred at Amegy, mainly due to improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio.

The balance of nonaccrual loans can decrease due to paydowns, charge-offs, and the return of loans to accrual status under certain conditions. If a nonaccrual loan is refinanced or restructured, the new note is immediately placed on nonaccrual. If a restructured loan performs under the new terms for at least a period of six months, the loan can be considered for return to accrual status. See “Restructured Loans” following for more information. Bank policy does not allow for the conversion of nonaccrual construction and land development loans to CRE term loans. See Note

Restructured Loans

Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) are loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties, and for whom we have granted a concession that we would not otherwise consider. TDRs decreased $24 million, or 11%, during 2018, primarily due to payments and payoffs. Commercial loans may be modified to provide the borrower more time to complete the project, to achieve a higher lease-up percentage, to sell the property, or for other reasons. Consumer loan TDRs represent loan modifications in which a concession has been granted to the borrower who is unable to refinance the loan with another lender, or who is experiencing economic hardship. Such consumer loan TDRs may include first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

If the restructured loan performs for at least six months according to the modified terms, and an analysis of the customer’s financial condition indicates that we are reasonably assured of repayment of the modified principal and interest, the loan may be returned to accrual status. The borrower’s payment performance prior to and following the restructuring is taken into account to determine whether a loan should be returned to accrual status.

Interest Rate and Market Risk Management

Interest rate and market risk are managed centrally. Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. As a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products, we are exposed to both interest rate risk and market risk.

The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for approving the overall policies relating to the management of the financial risk of the Bank, including interest rate and market risk management. The Board has established ALCO consisting of members of management, to which it has delegated the responsibility of managing interest rate and market risk for the Bank. ALCO establishes and periodically revises policy limits and reviews with the ROC the limits and limit exceptions reported by management.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is one of the most significant risks to which we are regularly exposed. In general, our goal in managing interest rate risk is to manage the balance sheet to reduce net income volatility due to changes in interest rates.

Over the course of the last year, we have maintained a moderate level of asset-sensitivity as the market rates seemed more likely to increase than to decrease. As risks shifted at the end of the year to be more balanced between higher or lower rates in the future, ALCO has undertaken strategies to reduce the level of asset sensitivity, such as entering into rate floor agreements and increasing the use of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to synthetically convert floating-rate assets to fixed-rate. We anticipate moving towards a less asset-sensitive interest rate risk position over the course of 2019.

Interest Rate Risk Measurement

We monitor interest rate risk through the use of two complementary measurement methods: net interest income simulation, or Earnings at Risk (“EaR”), and Economic Value of Equity at Risk (“EVE”). EaR analyzes the expected change in near term (one year) net interest income in response to changes in interest rates. In the EVE method, we measure the expected changes in the fair value of equity in response to changes in interest rates.

EaR is an estimate of the change in total net interest income that would be recognized under different rate environments over a one-year period. EaR is measured simulating net interest income under several different scenarios including parallel and nonparallel interest rate shifts across the yield curve, taking into account deposit repricing assumptions and estimates of the possible exercise of embedded options within the portfolio (e.g., a borrower’s ability to refinance a loan under a lower-rate environment). Our policy contains a trigger for a 10% decline in rate-sensitive income as well as a risk capacity of a 13% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps. As of December 31, 2018 the EaR declined by 12% for a 200 bps decline in rates. This trigger violation informed our decision to move to a less asset-sensitive position throughout 2019.

EVE is calculated as the fair value of all assets minus the fair value of liabilities. We measure changes in the dollar amount of EVE for parallel shifts in interest rates. Due to embedded optionality and asymmetric rate risk, changes in EVE can be useful in quantifying risks not apparent for small rate changes. Examples of such risks may include out-of-the-money interest rate caps (or limits) on loans, which have little effect under small rate movements but may become important if large rate changes were to occur, or substantial prepayment deceleration for low-rate mortgages



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

in a higher-rate environment. Our policy contains a trigger for an 8% decline in EVE as well as a risk capacity of a 10% decline if rates were to immediately rise or fall in parallel by 200 bps. Exceptions to the EVE limits are subject to notification and approval by the ROC.

Estimating the impact on net interest income and EVE requires that we assess a number of variables and make various assumptions in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates. The assessments address deposit withdrawals and deposit product migration (e.g., customers moving money from checking accounts to certificates of deposit), competitive pricing (e.g., existing loans and deposits are assumed to roll into new loans and deposits at similar spreads relative to benchmark interest rates), loan and security prepayments, and the effects of other similar embedded options. As a result of uncertainty about the maturity and repricing characteristics of both deposits and loans, we also calculate the sensitivity of EaR and EVE results to key assumptions. As most of our liabilities are comprised of indeterminate maturity and managed rate deposits, the modeled results are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for these deposits, such as checking, savings and money market accounts, and also to prepayment assumptions used for loans with prepayment options. We use historical regression analysis as a guide for setting such assumptions; however, due to the current low interest rate environment, which has little historical precedent, estimated deposit behavior may not reflect actual future results. Additionally, competition for funding in the marketplace has and may again result in changes to deposit pricing on interest-bearing accounts that are greater or less than changes in benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR or the federal funds rate.

Under most rising interest rate environments, we would expect some customers to move balances from demand deposits to interest-bearing accounts such as money market, savings, or certificates of deposit. The models are particularly sensitive to the assumption about the rate of such migration.

In addition, we assume certain correlation rates, often referred to as a “deposit beta,” of interest-bearing deposits, wherein the rates paid to customers change at a different pace when compared to changes in benchmark interest rates. Generally, certificates of deposit are assumed to have a high correlation rate, while interest-on-checking accounts are assumed to have a lower correlation rate. Actual results may differ materially due to factors including competitive pricing, money supply, credit worthiness of the Bank, and so forth; however, we use our historical experience as well as industry data to inform our assumptions.

The aforementioned migration and correlation assumptions result in deposit durations presented in

Schedule 26

.

Schedule 26

DEPOSIT ASSUMPTIONS

As of the dates indicated and incorporating the assumptions previously described, the following schedule shows EaR, or percentage change in net interest income, based on a static balance sheet size, in the first year after the interest rate change if interest rates were to sustain immediate parallel changes ranging from -100 bps to +300 bps.

Schedule 27

INCOME SIMULATION – CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME


Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift.

For non-maturity interest-bearing deposits, the weighted average modeled beta is 46%. If the weighted average deposit beta increased to 56% it would decrease the EaR in the +200bp shock from 5.1% to 2.8%.

The EaR analysis focuses on parallel rate shocks across the term structure of rates. The yield curve typically does not move in a parallel manner. During the past year, an increase in short-term rates has led to a flatter yield curve as longer-term rates have not increased at the same pace as short-term rates. If we consider a flattening rate shock where the short-term rate moves +200bp but the ten-year rate only moves +30bp, the increase in earnings is 43% lower over 12 months compared with the parallel +200bp rate shock.

For comparative purposes, the December 31, 2017 measures as presented in the following schedule.


Assumes rates cannot go below zero in the negative rate shift.

The asset-sensitivity as measured by EaR increased slightly year-over-year due to changes in the investment securities and funding compositions.

Schedule 28

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY

As of the dates indicated, the following schedule shows our estimated percentage change in EVE under parallel interest rate changes ranging from -100 bps to +300 bps. For

non-maturity interest-bearing deposits, the weighted average modeled beta is 46%. If the weighted average deposit beta increased to 56% it would decrease the EVE in the +200bp shock from -5.6% to -7.7%.

For comparative purposes, the

Our focus on business banking also plays a significant role in determining the nature of the Bank’s asset-liability management posture. At

December 31, 2018

, $20.4 billion of the Bank’s commercial lending and CRE loan balances were scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate loans approximately 98% are tied to either the prime rate or LIBOR. For these variable-rate loans we have executed $688 million of cash flow hedges by receiving fixed rates on interest rate swaps. Additionally, asset-sensitivity is reduced due to $48 million of variable-rate loans being priced at floored rates at

December 31, 2018

, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 74 bps. At

December 31, 2018

, we also had $3.3 billion of variable-rate consumer loans scheduled to reprice in the next six months. Of these variable-rate consumer loans approximately $9 million were priced at floored rates, which were above the “index plus spread” rate by an average of 81 bps.

Market Risk – Fixed Income

We engage in the underwriting and trading of municipal securities. This trading activity exposes us to a risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the prices of these fixed income securities.

At

December 31, 2018

, we had a relatively small amount,

$106 million

, of trading assets and

$85 million

of securities sold, not yet purchased, compared with

$148 million

and

$95 million

, respectively, at

December 31, 2017

.

We are exposed to market risk through changes in fair value. We are also exposed to market risk for interest rate swaps used to hedge interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of AFS securities and in interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges are included in AOCI for each financial reporting period. During


, the after-tax change in AOCI attributable to AFS securities decreased by $114 million, due largely to changes in the interest rate environment, compared with a $22 million decrease in the same prior year period.

Market Risk – Equity Investments

Through our equity investment activities, we own equity securities that are publicly-traded. In addition, we own equity securities in companies and governmental entities, e.g., Federal Reserve Bank and an FHLB, that are not publicly-traded. The accounting for equity investments may use the cost, fair value, equity, or full consolidation methods of accounting, depending on our ownership position and degree of involvement in influencing the investees’ affairs. Regardless of the accounting method, the value of our investment is subject to fluctuation. Because the fair value of these securities may fall below our investment costs, we are exposed to the possibility of loss. Equity investments in private and public companies are approved, monitored, and evaluated by the Bank’s Equity Investments Committee consisting of members of management.

We hold both direct and indirect investments in predominantly pre-public companies, primarily through various SBIC venture capital funds. Our equity exposure to these investments was approximately $132 million and $127 million at

December 31, 2018

and

December 31, 2017

, respectively. On occasion, some of the companies within our SBIC investments may issue an initial public offering. In this case, the fund is generally subject to a lockout period before liquidating the investment, which can introduce additional market risk.

Liquidity Risk Management

Overview

Liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash and collateral obligations and to manage both expected and unexpected cash flows without adversely impacting the operations or financial strength of the Bank. Sources of liquidity include both traditional forms of funding, such as deposits, borrowings, and equity and unencumbered assets, such as marketable loans and securities.

Since liquidity risk is closely linked to both credit risk and market risk, many of the previously discussed risk control mechanisms also apply to the monitoring and management of liquidity risk. We manage our liquidity to provide adequate funds for our customers’ credit needs, capital plan actions, anticipated financial and contractual obligations, which include withdrawals by depositors, debt and capital service requirements, and lease obligations.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Overseeing liquidity management is the responsibility of ALCO, which implements a Board-approved corporate Liquidity and Funding Policy. This policy addresses monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity, diversifying funding positions, and anticipating future funding needs. The policy also includes liquidity ratio guidelines, such as a 30-day liquidity coverage ratio, that are used to monitor the liquidity positions of the Bank as well as various stress test and liquid asset measurements for the Bank.

The management of liquidity and funding is performed by the Treasury Department under the direction of the Corporate Treasurer, with oversight by ALCO. The Treasurer is responsible for recommending changes to existing funding plans, as well as to the Bank’s Liquidity Policy. These recommendations must be submitted for approval to ALCO, and changes to the Policy also must be approved by the Bank’s ERMC and the Board of Directors. The Bank has adopted policy limits that govern liquidity risk. The policy requires the Bank to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to cover cash outflows in the event of a severe liquidity crisis. Throughout 2018 and as of December 31, 2018, the Bank complied with this policy.

Liquidity Regulation

Upon passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the Bank is no longer subject to the Enhanced Prudential Standards for liquidity management (Reg. YY). However, the Bank continues to perform liquidity stress tests and assess its portfolio of highly liquid assets (sufficient to cover 30-day funding needs under the stress scenarios). Although the Bank is no longer subject to the regulations of the Final LCR Rule, it exceeds the regulatory requirements that mandates a buffer of securities and other liquid assets to cover 70% of 30-day cash outflows under the assumptions mandated therein.

Liquidity Management Actions

The Bank’s consolidated cash, interest-bearing deposits held as investments, and security resell agreements was $2.4 billion at

December 31, 2018

compared to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017. During 2018 the primary sources of cash were from (1) a net increase in deposits, (2) net cash provided by operating activities, (3) short-term borrowings, (4) a net decrease in investment securities, and (5) the issuance of long-term debt. The primary uses of cash during the same period were primarily from (1) loan originations, (2) repurchases of our common stock, and (3) dividends on common and preferred stock.

The Bank’s loan to total deposit ratio has remained consistent and was 86% at

December 31, 2018

compared with 85% at December 31, 2017. The Bank’s core deposits, consisting of noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings and money market deposits, and time deposits under $250,000, was $51.2 billion at December 31, 2018 compared with $50.7 billion at December 31, 2017.

Total deposits were $54.1 billion at

December 31, 2018

, compared with $52.6 billion at

December 31, 2017

. The increase during 2018 was a result of a $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion increase in time deposits and savings and money market, respectively, partially offset by a $241 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits.

During 2018, the Bank issued a $500 million senior note with an interest rate of 3.5% and a maturity date of August 27, 2021. At

December 31, 2018

, maturities of our long-term senior and subordinated debt ranged from August 2021 to September 2028. Also, during 2018, the Bank called and redeemed $162 million of 5.65% subordinated notes maturing November 15, 2023.

The Bank’s cash payments for interest, reflected in operating expenses, increased to $237 million during


from $118 million during


primarily due to an increase in deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt and an increase in interest rates. Additionally, the Bank paid approximately $236 million of total dividends on preferred stock and common stock during


compared with $129 million during


. Dividends paid per common share have increased gradually from $0.12 in the third quarter of

General financial market and economic conditions impact our access to, and cost of, external financing. Access to funding markets for the Bank is also directly affected by the credit ratings received from various rating agencies.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The ratings not only influence the costs associated with the borrowings, but can also influence the sources of the borrowings. All of the credit rating agencies rate the Bank’s debt at an investment-grade level. The Bank’s credit ratings have continued to improve during 2018 and are presented in the following schedule.

CREDIT RATINGS

The FHLB system and Federal Reserve Banks have been and are a source of back-up liquidity, and from time to time, have been a significant source of funding. Zions Bancorporation, N.A. is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB allows member banks to borrow against their eligible loans and securities to satisfy liquidity and funding requirements. The Bank is required to invest in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock to maintain their borrowing capacity.

At

December 31, 2018

, the amount available for additional FHLB and Federal Reserve borrowings was approximately $13.8 billion, compared with $14.7 billion at

December 31, 2017

. Loans with a carrying value of approximately

$22.6 billion

at

December 31, 2018

have been pledged at the FHLB of Des Moines and the Federal Reserve as collateral for current and potential borrowings compared with

$25.6 billion

at

December 31, 2017

. At December 31, 2018, we had $4.5 billion of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding and no long-term FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding, compared with $3.6 billion of short-term FHLB borrowings and no long-term FHLB or Federal Reserve borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017. At

December 31, 2018

, our total investment in FHLB and Federal Reserve stock was $190 million and $139 million, respectively, compared with $154 million and $184 million at

December 31, 2017

.

Our investment activities can provide or use cash, depending on the asset-liability management posture taken. During


, held-to-maturity (“HTM”) and AFS investment securities’ activities resulted in a net decrease in investment securities and a net $130 million increase in cash, compared with a net $2.2 billion decrease in cash for

We may also, from time to time, issue additional preferred stock, senior or subordinated notes or other forms of capital or debt instruments, depending on our capital, funding, asset-liability management or other needs as market conditions warrant and subject to any required regulatory approvals. Management believes that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term and intermediate-term demands.

Contractual Obligations

Schedule 29

summarizes our contractual obligations at

December 31, 2018

.

Schedule 29

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS


Indeterminable maturity deposits include noninterest-bearing demand, savings and money market. Unrecognized tax benefits also have an indeterminable maturity.


Commitments to make venture and other noninterest-bearing investments do not have defined maturity dates. They have therefore been considered due on demand, maturing in one year or less.

In addition to the commitments specifically noted in

Schedule 29

, we enter into a number of contractual commitments in the ordinary course of business. These include software licensing and maintenance, telecommunications services, facilities maintenance and equipment servicing, supplies purchasing, and other goods and services used in the operation of our business. Some of these contracts are renewable or cancelable at least annually, and in certain cases, to secure favorable pricing concessions, we have committed to contracts that may extend to several years.

We also enter into derivative contracts under which we are required either to receive or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest. The fair value of the contracts changes daily as interest rates change. See Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on derivative contracts.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. In our ongoing efforts to identify and manage operational risk, we have an ERM department whose responsibility is to help employees, management and the Board of Directors to assess, understand, measure, manage, and monitor risk in accordance with our Risk Appetite Framework. We have documented both controls and the Control Self-Assessment related to financial reporting under the 2013 framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and the FDICIA.

To manage and minimize our operational risk, we have in place transactional documentation requirements; systems and procedures to monitor transactions and positions; systems and procedures to detect and mitigate attempts to commit fraud, penetrate our systems or telecommunications, access customer data, and/or deny normal access to



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

those systems to our legitimate customers; regulatory compliance reviews; and periodic reviews by the Bank’s Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit and Credit Examination departments. Reconciliation procedures have been established to ensure that data processing systems consistently and accurately capture critical data. In addition, the Data Governance department has key governance surrounding data integrity and availability oversight. Further, we have key programs and procedures to maintain contingency and business continuity plans for operational support in the event of natural or other disasters. We also mitigate certain operational risks through the purchase of insurance, including errors and omissions and professional liability insurance.

We are continually improving our oversight of operational risk, including enhancement of risk identification, risk and control self-assessments, and antifraud measures, which are reported on a regular basis to enterprise management committees. The Operational Risk Committee reports to the ERMC, which reports to the ROC. Key measures have been established to increase oversight by ERM and Operational Risk Management through the strengthening of new initiative reviews, enhancements to the Enterprise Procurement and Third Party Risk Management framework, enhancements to the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery programs and Enterprise Security programs, and the establishment of Fraud Risk Oversight, Incident Response Oversight and Technology Project Oversight programs. Significant enhancements have also been made to governance, technology, and reporting, including the establishment of Policy and Committee Governance programs, the implementation of a governance, risk and control solution, and the creation of an Enterprise Risk Profile and an Operational Risk Profile along with business line risk profiles. In addition, the establishment of an Enterprise Exam Management department has standardized our response and reporting, and increased our effectiveness and efficiencies with regulatory examinations, communications and issues management.

The number and sophistication of attempts to disrupt or penetrate our critical systems, sometimes referred to as hacking, cyber fraud, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism, or other similar names, also continue to grow. Given the importance and increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, the Bank has designated cyber risk a level one risk in its risk taxonomy, which places it at the highest level of oversight with its other top risks.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Overview

The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the policies associated with capital management. The Board has established the Capital Management Committee (“CMC”), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and consisting of members of management, whose primary responsibility is to recommend and administer the approved capital policies that govern the capital management of the Bank. Other major CMC responsibilities include:

•

Setting overall capital targets within the Board-approved capital policy, monitoring performance compared to the Bank’s Capital Policy limits, and recommending changes to capital including dividends, common stock repurchases, subordinated debt, and changes in major strategies to maintain the Bank at well-capitalized levels;

•

Maintaining an adequate capital cushion to withstand adverse stress events while continuing to meet the borrowing needs of its customers, and to provide reasonable assurance of continued access to wholesale funding, consistent with fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders; and

•

Reviewing agency ratings of the Bank.

The Bank has a fundamental financial objective to consistently produce superior risk-adjusted returns on its shareholders’ capital. We believe that a strong capital position is vital to continued profitability and to promoting depositor and investor confidence. Specifically, it is the policy of the Bank to:

•

Maintain sufficient capital to support current needs;

•

Maintain an adequate capital cushion to withstand future adverse stress events while continuing to meet borrowing needs of its customers; and

•

Meet fiduciary responsibilities to depositors and bondholders while managing capital distributions to shareholders through dividends and repurchases of common stock so as to be consistent with Federal Reserve guidelines SR 09-04 and 12 U.S.C §§ 56 and 60.

Merger of Bank Holding Company into Bank

On September 30, 2018, the Bank completed the merger of Zions Bancorporation, its former bank holding company, with, and into the Bank, formerly known as ZB, N.A. in order to reduce organizational complexity. The restructuring eliminated the bank holding company structure and associated regulatory framework, and resulted in ZB, N.A. being renamed Zions Bancorporation, National Association and becoming the top-level entity within our corporate structure. The Bank’s primary regulator is now the OCC. The Bank continues to be subject to examinations by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial regulations. Under the National Bank Act and OCC regulations, certain capital transaction may be subject to the approval of the OCC.

Stress Testing

As a result of the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s action on September 12, 2018 and the merger of the holding company into the Bank on September 30, 2018, the Bank is no longer considered a systemically important financial institution under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank expects to have greater flexibility in the active management of shareholders’ equity. The Bank expects to continue to utilize stress testing as the primary mechanism to inform its decisions on the appropriate level of capital, based upon actual and hypothetically-stressed economic conditions. Therefore, the timing and amount of capital actions will be subject to various factors, including the Bank's financial performance and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions.

Capital Management Actions

During 2018, the Bank repurchased 12.9 million shares of common stock for $670 million at an average price of $51.77 per share. In February 2019, the Bank announced that the Board approved a plan to repurchase $275 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2019. The timing and amount of additional common share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Bank's financial performance, business needs, prevailing economic conditions, and OCC approval. Shares may be repurchased occasionally in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise.

The Bank paid common dividends of $202 million, or $1.04 per share, during 2018 compared to $89 million, $0.44 per share, during 2017. In February 2019, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.30 per common share payable on February 21, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 14, 2019. We paid dividends on preferred stock of $34 million during

Total shareholders’ equity decreased slightly and was $7.6 billion at

December 31, 2018

compared with $7.7 billion at

December 31, 2017

. This decrease was primarily a result of (1) $670 million from repurchases of Bank common stock, (2) $236 million from common and preferred dividends paid and (3) $111 million from a decrease in the fair value of our AFS securities due largely to changes in the interest rate environment. These decreases were partially offset by net income of $884 million.

During 2018 and 2017, the market price of our common stock was higher than the exercise price of common stock warrants on our common stock and had a dilutive effect upon earnings per share. Weighted average diluted shares decreased by 3.2 million compared with


, primarily due to share repurchases, partially offset by the dilutive impact of an increased common share price on warrants that have been outstanding since 2008 (Troubled Asset Relief Program or “TARP” warrants - NASDAQ: ZIONZ) and 2010 (NASDAQ: ZIONW) and employee equity grants. During 2018, 1.8 million shares of common stock were issued from the cashless exercise of 5.8 million ZIONZ common stock warrants which expired on November 14, 2018. As of

December 31, 2018

IMPACT OF COMMON STOCK WARRANTS

Basel III

In 2013, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC published final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III capital rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components. In November 2017, the FRB, FDIC and OCC published a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain U.S. Basel III capital rules for non-advanced approaches banks, such as the Bank. Effective January 1, 2018, the final rule retains the 2017 Basel III transitional treatment of certain DTAs and mortgage servicing assets, among others. A detailed discussion of Basel III requirements, including implications for the Bank, is contained on page


in “Capital Standards – Basel Framework” under Part 1, Item 1 in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules based upon phase-in rules as of December 31, 2018, and believe that we would meet all capital adequacy requirements on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.

Capital Ratios

Banking organizations are required by capital regulations to maintain adequate levels of capital as measured by several regulatory capital ratios.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the Bank’s significant accounting policies. Discussed below are certain significant accounting policies that we consider critical to the Bank’s financial statements. These critical accounting policies were selected because the amounts affected by them are significant to the financial statements. Any changes to these amounts, including changes in estimates, may also be significant to the financial statements. We believe that an understanding of these policies, along with the related estimates we are required to make in recording the financial transactions of the Bank, is important to have a complete picture of the Bank’s financial condition. In addition, in arriving at these estimates, we are required to make complex and subjective judgments, many of which include a high degree of uncertainty. The following discussion of these critical accounting policies includes the significant estimates related to these policies. We have discussed each of these accounting policies and the related estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

We have included, where applicable in this document, sensitivity schedules and other examples to demonstrate the impact of the changes in estimates made for various financial transactions. The sensitivities in these schedules and examples are hypothetical and should be viewed with caution. Changes in estimates are based on variations in assumptions and are not subject to simple extrapolation, as the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in the amount of the estimate may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a variation in one assumption is in reality likely to cause changes in other assumptions, which could potentially magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

Fair Value Estimates

We measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP has established a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among (1) observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets, (2) inputs



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

other than quoted prices with observable market data, and (3) unobservable data such as the Bank’s own data or single dealer nonbinding pricing quotes.

When observable market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis. These modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, the life of the asset and applicable growth rate, the risk of nonperformance, and other related assumptions.

The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than the carrying value of the item being valued. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.

For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, the Bank’s policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. In certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, the Bank is required to make judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. The models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.

Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. When market data is not available, the Bank uses valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.

Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including HTM securities, loans held for sale, and OREO) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.

Impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed.

Investment securities are valued using several methodologies, which depend on the nature of the security, availability of current market information, and other factors. Investment securities in an unrealized loss position are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). OTTI is considered to have occurred if the instrument’s fair value is below its amortized cost and (1) we intend to sell the security, or (2) it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. The “more likely than not” criterion is a lower threshold than the “probable” criterion.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The ACL includes the ALLL and the RULC. The ALLL represents management’s estimate of probable losses believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the portfolios. This process includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, as well as a qualitative review of the results. The qualitative review requires a significant amount of judgment, and is described in more detail in Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The RULC provides for potential losses associated with off-balance sheet lending commitments and standby letters of credit. The reserve is estimated using the same procedures and methodologies as for the ALLL, plus assumptions regarding the probability and amount of unfunded commitments being drawn.

Although we believe that our processes for determining an appropriate level for the allowance adequately address the various components that could potentially result in credit losses, the processes and their elements include features that may be susceptible to significant change. Any unfavorable differences between the actual outcome of credit-related events and our estimates could require an additional provision for credit losses.

As an example, if the probability of default risk grade for all pass-graded commercial and CRE loans was immediately downgraded one grade on our internal risk-grading scale, the quantitatively determined amount of the ALLL at December 31, 2018 would increase by approximately $89 million. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and has been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in risk grades may have on the allowance estimate.

Although the qualitative process is subjective, it represents the Bank’s best estimate of qualitative factors impacting the determination of the ACL. We believe that given the procedures we follow in determining the ACL, the various components used in the current estimation processes are appropriate.

Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Credit Risk Management” on page


contains further information and more specific descriptions of the processes and methodologies used to estimate the ACL.

Accounting for Goodwill

Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value in the financials of a reporting unit at the time of its acquisition and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with current accounting guidance. We perform this test at the beginning of the fourth quarter annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of our reporting units, inclusive of goodwill, is less than fair value. The goodwill impairment test for a given reporting unit compares its fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying amount, inclusive of goodwill, is more likely than not to exceed its fair value, additional quantitative analysis must be performed to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. Our reporting units with goodwill are Amegy, CB&T and Zions Bank.

To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we historically have used a combination of up to three separate quantitative methods: comparable publicly-traded commercial banks in the western and southwestern states (“Market Value”); where applicable, comparable acquisitions of commercial banks in the western and southwestern states (“Transaction Value”); and the discounted present value of management’s estimates of future cash flows. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these calculations include:

•

selection of comparable publicly-traded companies based on location, size, and business focus and composition;

•

selection of market comparable acquisition transactions based on location, size, business focus and composition, and date of the transaction;

•

the discount rate, which is based on the Bank’s estimate of its cost of equity capital;

•

the projections of future earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit;

•

the relative weight given to the valuations derived by the three methods described; and

•

the control premium associated with reporting units.

We apply a control premium in the Market Value approach to determine the reporting units’ equity values. Control premiums represent the ability of a controlling shareholder to change how the Bank is managed and can cause the fair value of a reporting unit as a whole to exceed its market capitalization. Based on a review of historical bank acquisition transactions within the Bank’s geographic footprint, and a comparison of the target banks’ market values 30 days prior to the announced transaction to the deal value, we have determined that a control premium ranging from 0% to 15% for the reporting units was appropriate.

Since estimates are an integral part of the impairment computations, changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on any calculated impairment amount. Estimates include economic conditions, which impact the



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates, and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporate current economic and market conditions, including Federal Reserve monetary policy expectations and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes. Additional factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, loan losses, changes in growth trends, cost structures and technology, changes in equity market values and merger and acquisition valuations, and changes in industry conditions.

Weakening in the economic environment, a decline in the performance of the reporting units, or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Bank

’

s regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio, or liquidity position.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed a full quantitative analysis of the reporting units’ fair value as described above. Our evaluation process determined that the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank exceeded their carrying values by 35%, 54%, and 78%, respectively. Additionally, we performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis on the discount rate assumption to evaluate the impact of an adverse change to this assumption. If the discount rate applied to future earnings were increased by 100 bps, the fair values of Amegy, CB&T, and Zions Bank would exceed their carrying values by 33%, 52%, and 72%, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of


, we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation, effective October 1,


. The Bank elected to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if the quantitative analysis performed in prior years as described above was required. The Bank’s qualitative analysis assessed factors related to each reporting unit to determine if it was more likely than not that the carrying value of any reporting unit was greater than the unit’s fair value. The qualitative factors considered in our assessment for each reporting unit included (1) economic, industry and market conditions, (2) regulatory or political developments that could negatively impact operating costs and overall financial performance of any of our specific reporting units, and (3) any changes in management, key personnel, strategy, customers, and any new or evolving litigation.

None of the factors considered in our qualitative assessment gave any indication that the reporting units’ fair values decreased during the 2018 fiscal year. Additionally, as evidenced in the Business Segment Analysis section of the MD&A, each reporting unit’s key performance metrics remained materially unchanged or improved in 2018 compared to 2017. Considering the improved performance of each reporting unit and the lack of any significant concerns being identified in our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit continues to be greater than its carry amount making further quantitative impairment testing unnecessary. As a result, none of our reporting units were subject to goodwill impairment during 2018 or were determined to be at-risk for a potential goodwill impairment in the near future based on information known at this time.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT ON MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Zions Bancorporation, National Association and subsidiaries (“the Bank”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Bank as defined by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Although any system of internal control can be compromised by human error or intentional circumvention of required procedures, we believe our system provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are recorded and reported properly, providing an adequate basis for reliable financial statements.

The Bank’s management has used the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the COSO to evaluate the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Bank’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2018

and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective. There are no material weaknesses in the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by the Bank’s management.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended

December 31, 2018

and has also issued an attestation report, which is included herein, on internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zions Bancorporation, National Association and Subsidiaries

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Zions Bancorporation, National Association and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Zions Bancorporation, National Association and subsidiaries (“the Bank”) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2018 consolidated financial statements of the Bank and our report dated February 25, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Bank’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business

Zions Bancorporation, National Association, (“Zions Bancorporation, N.A.”, “the Bank,” “we,” “our,” “us”) is a national commercial bank headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Bank provides a full range of banking and related services in


western and southwestern states through seven separately managed and branded units as follows: Zions Bank, in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming; California Bank & Trust (“CB&T”); Amegy Bank (“Amegy”), in Texas; National Bank of Arizona (“NBAZ”); Nevada State Bank (“NSB”); Vectra Bank Colorado (“Vectra”), in Colorado and New Mexico; and The Commerce Bank of Washington (“TCBW”) which operates under that name in Washington and under the name The Commerce Bank of Oregon (“TCBO”) in Oregon.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Zions Bancorporation, National Association and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Unconsolidated investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the respective investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting; those that are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method of accounting are accounted for under cost or fair value accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices within the financial services industry. References to GAAP, including standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), are made according to sections of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Changes to the ASC are made with Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) that include consensus issues of the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”). In certain cases, ASUs are issued jointly with International Financial Reporting Standards.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect net income or shareholders’ equity.

Variable Interest Entities

A variable interest entity (“VIE”) is consolidated when a company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Current accounting guidance requires continuous analysis on a qualitative rather than a quantitative basis to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE. At the commencement of our involvement, and periodically thereafter, we consider our consolidation conclusions for all entities with which we are involved. As of

December 31, 2018

and


, no VIEs have been consolidated in the Bank’s financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows, “cash and cash equivalents” are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks in the consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Estimates

We measure many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. To improve consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP has established a hierarchy to prioritize the valuation inputs among three levels. The Bank prioritizes quoted prices in active markets and minimizes reliance on



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

unobservable inputs when possible. When observable market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis. These modeling techniques use assumptions that market participants would consider in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, the life of the asset and applicable growth rate, the risk of nonperformance, and other related assumptions. Changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. When market data is not available, the Bank uses valuation techniques requiring professional judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value. See Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the use of fair value estimates.

Security Resell Agreements

Security resell agreements represent overnight and term agreements with the majority maturing within


days. These agreements are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at amounts at which the securities were acquired plus accrued interest. Either the Bank, or in some instances third parties on its behalf, take possession of the underlying securities. The fair value of such securities is monitored throughout the contract term to ensure that asset values remain sufficient to protect against counterparty default. We are permitted by contract to sell or repledge certain securities that we accept as collateral for security resell agreements. If sold, our obligation to return the collateral is recorded as “securities sold, not yet purchased” and included as a liability in “Federal funds and other short-term borrowings.” At

December 31, 2018

, we held

$1.2 billion

of securities for which we were permitted by contract to sell or repledge. Security resell agreements averaged

$488 million

during


, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month-end during


was

$1.2 billion

.

Investment Securities

We classify our investment securities according to their purpose and holding period. Gains or losses on the sale of securities are recognized using the specific identification method and recorded in noninterest income.

Held-to-maturity (“HTM”) debt securities are carried at amortized cost with purchase discounts or premiums accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the security. The Bank has the intent and ability to hold such securities until maturity.

Available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities are stated at fair value and generally consist of debt securities held for investment. Unrealized gains and losses of AFS securities, after applicable taxes, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”).

We review quarterly our investment securities portfolio for any declines in value that are considered to be other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). The process, methodology, and factors considered to evaluate securities for OTTI are discussed further in Note


.

Trading securities are stated at fair value and consist of securities acquired for short-term appreciation or other trading purposes. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in trading income, which is included in “Capital markets and foreign exchange.”

The fair values of investment securities, as estimated under current accounting guidance, are discussed in Note


.

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

Loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Unearned income, which includes deferred fees net of deferred direct loan origination costs, is amortized to interest income over the life of the loan using the interest method. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.

At the time of origination, we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale. We may subsequently change our intent to hold loans for investment and reclassify them as held for sale. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. A valuation allowance is recorded when cost exceeds fair value based on reviews at the time of reclassification and periodically thereafter. Gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income based on the difference between sales proceeds and carrying value.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

We evaluate loans throughout their lives for signs of credit deterioration, which may impact the loan’s status, and potentially impact our accounting for that loan. Loan status categories include past due as to contractual payments, nonaccrual, impaired, and restructured (including troubled debt restructurings “TDRs”). Our accounting policies for these loan statuses and our estimation of the related allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) are discussed further in Note


.

In the ordinary course of business, we transfer portions of loans under participation agreements to manage credit risk and our portfolio concentration. We evaluate the loan participations to determine if they meet the appropriate accounting guidance to qualify as sales. Certain purchased loans require separate accounting procedures that are also discussed in Note


.

The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) includes the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments (“RULC”) and represents our estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio that may be recognized from loans and lending commitments that are not recoverable. Further discussion of our estimation process for the ACL is included in Note


.

Other Noninterest-Bearing Investments

These investments include investments in private equity funds (referred to in this document as private equity investments “PEIs”), venture capital securities, securities acquired for various debt and regulatory requirements, bank-owned life insurance, and certain other noninterest-bearing investments. See further discussions in Notes


,


and


.

Certain PEIs and venture capital securities are accounted for under the equity method and reported at fair value. Changes in fair value and gains and losses from sales are recognized in noninterest income. The values assigned to the securities where no market quotations exist are based upon available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that will ultimately be realized. Such estimated amounts depend on future circumstances and will not be realized until the individual securities are liquidated.

Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for at fair value based on the cash surrender values (“CSVs”) of the general account insurance policies. A third-party service provides these values.

Other PEIs and those acquired for various debt and regulatory requirements are accounted for at cost. Periodic reviews are conducted for impairment by comparing carrying values with estimates of fair value determined according to the previous discussion.

Premises, Equipment and Software, Net

Premises, equipment and software are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation, computed primarily on the straight-line method, is charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the properties, generally


to


years for buildings,


to


years for furniture and equipment, and


to


years for software, including capitalized costs related to the Bank’s technology initiatives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements (including any extension options that are reasonably certain to be exercised), whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized. We subject these assets to annual specified impairment tests as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and more frequently if changing conditions warrant. Core deposit assets and other intangibles with finite useful lives are generally amortized on an accelerated basis using an estimated useful life of up to


years.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Upon initially obtaining control, we recognize

100%

of all acquired assets and all assumed liabilities regardless of the percentage owned. The assets and liabilities are recorded at their estimated fair values, with goodwill being recorded when such fair values are less than the cost of acquisition. Certain transaction and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Changes to estimated fair values from a business combination are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill over the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in our statement of income from the date of acquisition.

Other Real Estate Owned

Other real estate owned (“OREO”) consists principally of commercial and residential real estate obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. Amounts are recorded initially at fair value (less any selling costs) based on property appraisals at the time of transfer and subsequently at the lower of cost or fair value (less any selling costs).

Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, purchased and sold options such as floors and basis swaps, as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy. Derivatives are an important tool used in managing our overall asset and liability sensitivities to remain within management’s stated interest rate risk thresholds. Their use allows us to adjust and align our naturally occurring mix of fixed and floating-rate assets and liabilities to manage interest income volatility by synthetically converting variable-rate assets to fixed-rate, or synthetically converting fixed-rate funding instruments to floating rates.

We also execute both interest rate and short-term foreign currency derivative instruments with our commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management strategies. These derivatives are immediately hedged by offsetting derivatives with third parties such that we minimize our net risk exposure as a result of such transactions. We record all derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. See Note


for more information.

Derivatives in Designated Accounting Hedge

We apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes, primarily interest rate risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and the hedging relationship must be formally documented. We primarily use regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship, unless the hedge qualifies for other methods of assessing effectiveness (e.g. shortcut or critical terms match), both at inception and on an ongoing basis. We use Accounting Hedges as designated fair value and cash flow hedges and can be a significant aspect of the Bank’s overall interest risk sensitivity management. The Bank may add additional hedging strategies and apply hedge accounting to the strategies as it deems necessary. See Note


for more information regarding the accounting for derivatives designated as hedging instruments.

Commitments and Letters of Credit

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they become payable. The credit risk associated with these commitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the ALLL. The RULC is presented separately in the balance sheet.

Revenue Recognition

Service charges and fees on deposit accounts are recognized in accordance with published deposit account agreements for customer accounts or contractual agreements for commercial accounts. Other service charges, commissions and fees include interchange fees, bank services, and other fees, which are generally recognized at the time of transaction or as the services are performed.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation generally includes grants of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other awards to employees and non-employee directors. We recognize compensation expense in the statement of income based on the grant-date value of the associated share-based awards. See further discussion in Note


.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement asset and liability amounts and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. Unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions relate primarily to tax credits on technology initiatives. See further discussion in Note


.

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Net earnings per common share is based on net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is net of preferred stock dividends. Basic net earnings per common share is based on the weighted average outstanding common shares during each year. Unvested share-based awards with rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends are considered participating securities and included in the computation of basic earnings per share. Diluted net earnings per common share is based on the weighted average outstanding common shares during each year, including common stock equivalents. Stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, and stock warrants are converted to common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method. Diluted net earnings per common share excludes common stock equivalents whose effect is antidilutive. See further discussion in Note

FAIR VALUE

Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, a hierarchy has been established that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. This hierarchy uses three levels of inputs to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities as follows:

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Bank has the ability to access;

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets, observable inputs other than quoted prices that are used in the valuation of an asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means; and

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose value is determined by pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Market activity is presumed to be orderly in the absence of evidence of forced or disorderly sales, although such sales may still be indicative of fair value. Applicable accounting guidance precludes the use of blockage factors or liquidity adjustments due to the quantity of securities held by an entity.

We use fair value to measure certain assets and liabilities on a recurring basis when fair value is the primary measure for accounting. Fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets when adjusting carrying values, such as the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting, including recognition of impairment on assets. Fair value is also used when providing required disclosures for certain financial instruments.

Fair Value Policies and Procedures

We have various policies, processes and controls in place to ensure that fair values are reasonably developed, reviewed and approved for use. These include a Securities Valuation Committee, comprised of executive management, that reviews and approves on a quarterly basis the key components of fair value estimation, including critical valuation assumptions for Level 3 modeling. A Model Risk Management Group conducts model validations, including internal models, and sets policies and procedures for revalidation, including the timing of revalidation.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Third Party Service Providers

We use a third party pricing service to measure fair value for approximately

95%

of our AFS Level 2 securities. Fair value measurements for other AFS Level 2 securities generally use certain inputs corroborated by market data and include standard discounted cash flow analysis.

For Level 2 securities, the third party pricing service provides documentation on an ongoing basis that presents market corroborative data, including detail pricing information and market reference data. The documentation includes benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data, including information from the vendor trading platform. We review, test and validate this information as appropriate. Absent observable trade data, we do not adjust prices from our third party sources.

The following describes the hierarchy designations, valuation methodologies, and key inputs to measure fair value on a recurring basis for designated financial instruments:

U.S. Treasury, Agencies and Corporations

U.S. Treasury securities are measured under Level 1 using quoted market prices when available. U.S. agencies and corporations are measured under Level 2 generally using the previously discussed third party pricing service.

Municipal Securities

Municipal securities are measured under Level 2 using the third party pricing service.

Money Market Mutual Funds and Other

Money market mutual funds and other securities are measured under Level 1 or Level 2. For Level 1, quoted market prices are used which may include net asset values (“NAVs”) or their equivalents. Level 2 valuations generally use quoted prices for similar securities. With the adoption of ASU 2016-01, as of January 1, 2018 our money market mutual funds are no longer classified as AFS and are now recognized in trading.

Trading Account

Securities in the trading account are generally measured under Level 2 using third party pricing service providers as described previously.

Held-to-Maturity

HTM securities are carried at amortized cost, but for disclosure purposes are measured at fair value using a third party pricing service or an internal model. The internal model utilizes observable market yields as inputs.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance

Bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) is measured under Level 2 according to CSVs of the insurance policies that are provided by a third party service. Nearly all policies are general account policies with CSVs based on the Bank’s claims on the assets of the insurance companies. The insurance companies’ investments include predominantly fixed income securities consisting of investment-grade corporate bonds and various types of mortgage instruments. Management regularly reviews its BOLI investment performance, including concentrations among insurance providers.

Private Equity Investments

PEIs are generally measured under Level 3. The majority of these PEIs are held in the Bank’s Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) and are early-stage venture investments. The fair value measurements of these investments are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, including whenever a new round of financing occurs. Certain of these investments may be measured using multiples of operating performance. The fair value measurements of PEIs are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Securities Valuation Committee. The Equity Investments Committee,



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

consisting of executives familiar with the investments, reviews periodic financial information, including audited financial statements when available.

Certain valuation analytics may be employed that include current and projected financial performance, recent financing activities, economic and market conditions, market comparables, market liquidity, sales restrictions, and other factors. A significant change in the expected performance of the individual investment would result in a change in the fair value measurement of the investment.

Agriculture Loan Servicing

This asset results from our servicing of agriculture loans approved and funded by Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“FAMC”). We provide this servicing under an agreement with FAMC for loans they own. The asset’s fair value represents our projection of the present value of future cash flows measured under Level 3 using discounted cash flow methodologies.

Interest-Only Strips

Interest-only strips are created as a by-product of the securitization process. When the guaranteed portions of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) loans are pooled, interest-only strips may be created in the pooling process. The asset’s fair value represents our projection of the present value of future cash flows measured under Level 3 using discounted cash flow methodologies.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Obligations

Invested assets in the deferred compensation plan consist of shares of registered investment companies. These mutual funds are valued under Level 1 at quoted market prices, which represents the NAV of shares held by the plan at the end of the period.

Derivatives

Derivatives are measured according to their classification as either exchange-traded or over-the-counter. Exchange-traded derivatives consist of foreign currency exchange contracts measured under Level 1 because they are traded in active markets. Over-the-counter derivatives, including those for customers, consist of interest rate swaps and options. These derivatives are measured under Level 2 using third party services. Observable market inputs include yield curves (the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) swap curve and relevant overnight index swap curves), foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, option volatilities, counterparty credit risk, and other related data. Credit valuation adjustments are required to reflect nonperformance risk for both the Bank and the respective counterparty. These adjustments are determined generally by applying a credit spread to the total expected exposure of the derivative.

Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased

Securities sold, not yet purchased, included in “Federal funds and other short-term borrowings” on the balance sheet, are measured under Level 1 using quoted market prices. If not available, quoted prices under Level 2 for similar securities are used.

Loans

Loans are generally carried at amortized cost, but for disclosure purposes are measured at fair value according to their status as nonimpaired or impaired. For nonimpaired loans, fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the LIBOR yield curve adjusted by a factor which reflects the credit, interest rate risk, and liquidity inherent in the loan. These future cash flows are then reduced by the estimated “life-of-the-loan” aggregate credit losses in the loan portfolio. These adjustments for lifetime future credit losses are derived from the methods used to estimate the ALLL for our loan portfolio and are adjusted quarterly as necessary to reflect the most recent loss experience. Impaired loans that are collateral-dependent are already considered to be held at fair value. Impaired loans that are not collateral-dependent have future cash flows reduced by the estimated “life-of-the-loan” credit loss



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

derived from methods used to estimate the ALLL for these loans. See Impaired Loans in Note


for details on the impairment measurement method for impaired loans. Loans, other than those held for sale, are not normally purchased and sold by the Bank, and there are no active trading markets for most of this portfolio.

Impaired (or nonperforming) loans that are collateral-dependent were measured at fair value based on the fair value of the collateral. OREO was measured initially at fair value based on collateral appraisals at the time of transfer and subsequently at the lower of cost or fair value.

Measurement of fair value for collateral-dependent loans and OREO was based on third party appraisals that utilize one or more valuation techniques (income, market and/or cost approaches). Any adjustments to calculated fair value were made based on recently completed and validated third party appraisals, third party appraisal services, automated valuation services, or our informed judgment. Evaluations were made to determine that the appraisal process met the relevant concepts and requirements of applicable accounting guidance.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Automated valuation services may be used primarily for residential properties when values from any of the previous methods were not available within 90 days of the balance sheet date. These services use models based on market, economic, and demographic values. The use of these models has only occurred in a very few instances and the related property valuations have not been sufficiently significant to consider disclosure under Level 3 rather than Level 2.

Impaired loans that are not collateral-dependent were measured based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the expected coupon rates over the lives of the loans. Because the loans were not discounted at market interest rates, the valuations do not represent fair value and have been excluded from the nonrecurring fair value balance in the preceding schedules.

Fair Value of Certain Financial Instruments

Following is a summary of the carrying values and estimated fair values of certain financial instruments:

This summary excludes financial assets and liabilities for which carrying value approximates fair value and financial instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Financial instruments for which carrying values approximate fair value include cash and due from banks, money market investments, demand, savings and money market deposits, federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings, and security repurchase agreements. The estimated fair value of demand, savings and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Carrying value is used because the accounts have no stated maturity and the customer has the ability to withdraw funds immediately. Time and foreign deposits, and any other short-term borrowings, are measured at fair value by discounting future cash flows using the LIBOR yield curve to the given maturity dates. Long-term debt is measured at fair value based on actual market trades (i.e., an asset value) when available, or discounting cash flows to maturity using the LIBOR yield curve adjusted for credit spreads. The methods used to measure fair value for HTM securities and loans were previously described in this footnote.

These fair value disclosures represent our best estimates based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, future expected loss experience, risk characteristics of the various instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and cannot be determined with precision. Changes in these methodologies and assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

INVESTMENTS

Investment Securities

Securities are classified as HTM, AFS or trading. HTM securities, which management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost. AFS securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Realized gains and losses on AFS securities are determined by using the cost basis of each individual security. Trading securities are carried at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current period earnings. The purchase premiums for callable debt securities classified as held-to-maturity HTM or AFS are amortized at a constant

effective yield to the earliest call date. The purchase premiums and discounts for all other HTM and AFS securities are amortized and accreted at a constant effective yield to the contractual maturity date and no assumption is made concerning prepayments. As principal prepayments occur, the portion of the unamortized premium or discount associated with the principal reduction is recognized in interest income in the period the principal is reduced. Note


discusses the process to estimate fair value for investment securities. The purchase premiums for callable debt securities classified as HTM or AFS are amortized at a constant effective yield to the earliest call date.

Maturities

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment debt securities are shown subsequently as of

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment

Ongoing Policy

We review investment securities on a quarterly basis for the presence of OTTI. We assess whether OTTI is present when the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. When we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security then the decline in fair value is considered to be other-



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

than-temporary. OTTI is considered to have occurred for debt securities in unrealized loss positions if we have formed a documented intent to sell identified securities or initiated such sales or it is “more likely than not” we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these scenarios the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that we have the intent and ability to hold, the expected cash flows to be received from the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. Unrealized losses relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI.

Our OTTI evaluation process takes into consideration current market conditions; fair value in relationship to cost; extent and nature of change in fair value; severity and duration of the impairment; recent events specific to the issuer or industry; our assessment of the creditworthiness of the issuer, including external credit ratings, changes, recent downgrades, and trends; the cash flow priority position of the instrument that we hold in the case of structured securities; volatility of earnings and trends; current analysts’ evaluations; all available information relevant to the collectability of debt securities; and other key measures. In addition, for AFS securities with fair values below amortized cost, we must determine if we intend to sell the securities or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. For HTM securities, we must determine we have the ability to hold the securities to maturity. We consider any other relevant factors before concluding our evaluation for the existence of OTTI in our securities portfolio.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Conclusions

The Bank did not recognize any OTTI on its investment securities portfolio during


. Unrealized losses relate to changes in interest rates subsequent to purchase and are not attributable to credit. At

December 31, 2018

, we did not have an intent to sell identified securities with unrealized losses or initiate such sales, and we believe it is not more likely than not we would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.

To determine the credit component of OTTI for all security types, we utilize projected cash flows. These cash flows are credit adjusted using, among other things, assumptions for default probability and loss severity. Certain other unobservable inputs such as prepayment rate assumptions are also utilized. In addition, certain internal models may be utilized. See Note


for further discussion. To determine the credit-related portion of OTTI in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we use the security specific effective interest rate when estimating the present value of cash flows.

Effect of Volcker Rule

The Bank’s PEIs are subject to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks from holding PEIs, except for SBIC funds and certain other permitted exclusions, beyond a required deadline. The Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”) announced in December 2016 that it would allow banks to apply for an additional five-year extension beyond the July 21, 2017 deadline to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act requirement for these investments. The Bank applied for and was granted an extension for its eligible PEIs. All positions in the remaining portfolio of PEIs are subject to the extended deadline or other applicable exclusions.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments (“RULC”).

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

The ALLL represents our estimate of probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Losses are charged to the ALLL when recognized. Generally, commercial and commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans are charged off or charged down when they are determined to be uncollectible in whole or in part, or when


days past due, unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are either charged off or charged down to net realizable value no later than the month in which they become


days past due. Closed-end consumer loans that are not secured by residential real estate are either charged off or charged down to net realizable value no later than the month in which they become 120 days past due. We establish the amount of the ALLL by analyzing the portfolio at least quarterly, and we adjust the provision for loan losses so the ALLL is at an appropriate level at the balance sheet date.

We determine our ALLL as the best estimate within a range of estimated losses. The methodologies we use to estimate the ALLL depend upon the impairment status and loan portfolio. The methodology for impaired loans is discussed subsequently. For commercial and CRE loans with commitments greater than

$1 million

, we assign internal risk grades using a comprehensive loan grading system based on financial and statistical models, individual credit analysis, and loan officer experience and judgment. The credit quality indicators discussed subsequently are based on this grading system. Estimated losses for these commercial and CRE loans are derived from a statistical analysis of our historical default and loss given default experience over the period of January 2008 through the most recent full quarter.

For consumer and small commercial and CRE loans with commitments less than or equal to

$1 million

, we primarily use roll rate models to forecast probable inherent losses. Roll rate models measure the rate at which these loans migrate from one delinquency category to the next worse delinquency category, and eventually to loss. We estimate roll rates for these loans using recent delinquency and loss experience by segmenting our loan portfolios into separate pools based on common risk characteristics and separately calculating historical delinquency and loss experience for each pool. These roll rates are then applied to current delinquency levels to estimate probable inherent losses.

The current status and historical changes in qualitative and environmental factors may not be reflected in our quantitative models. Thus, after applying historical loss experience, as described above, we review the quantitatively derived level of ALLL for each segment using qualitative criteria, and use those criteria to determine



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

our qualitative estimate. We monitor various risk factors that influence our judgment regarding the level of the ALLL across the portfolio segments. These factors primarily include:

•

Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices;

•

Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions;

•

Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;

•

Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;

•

Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;

•

Changes in the quality of the loan review system;

•

Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans;

•

The existence and effect of any concentration of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations;

•

The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements;

The magnitude of the impact of these factors on our qualitative assessment of the ALLL changes from quarter to quarter according to changes made by management in its assessment of these factors, the extent these factors are already reflected in historical loss rates, and the extent changes in these factors diverge from one to another. We also consider the uncertainty inherent in the estimation process when evaluating the ALLL.

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments

The RULC represents our estimated reserve for potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, including standby letters of credit. We estimate the RULC using the same procedures and methodologies that we use for the ALLL. The loss factors and qualitative adjustments used in the RULC are the same as the loss factors and qualitative adjustments used in the ALLL. We adjust the Bank’s unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable to an outstanding amount equivalent using credit conversion factors, and we apply the loss factors to the outstanding equivalents.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses are summarized as follows:

The ALLL and outstanding loan balances according to the Bank’s impairment method are summarized as follows:



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, or the loan is


days or more past due as to principal or interest, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Factors we consider in determining whether a loan is placed on nonaccrual include delinquency status, collateral-value, borrower or guarantor financial statement information, bankruptcy status, and other information which would indicate that the full and timely collection of interest and principal is uncertain.

A nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement; the loan, if secured, is well secured; the borrower has paid according to the contractual terms for a minimum of six months; and analysis of the borrower indicates a reasonable assurance of the ability and willingness to maintain payments. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding.

Closed-end loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported as past due when the borrower is in arrears for

two

or more monthly payments. Similarly, open-end credits, such as charge-card plans and other revolving credit plans, are reported as past due when the minimum payment has not been made for

two

or more billing cycles. Other multi-payment obligations (i.e., quarterly, semiannual, etc.), single payment, and demand notes, are reported as past due when either principal or interest is due and unpaid for a period of


days or more.

Represents nonaccrual loans that are not past due more than 30 days; however, full payment of principal and interest is still not expected.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Credit Quality Indicators

In addition to the past due and nonaccrual criteria, we also analyze loans using loan risk-grading systems, which vary based on the size and type of credit risk exposure. The internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful, which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications.

Definitions of Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful are summarized as follows:

Pass –

A Pass asset is higher quality and does not fit any of the other categories described below. The likelihood of loss is considered low.

Special Mention –

A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Bank’s credit position at some future date.

Substandard –

A Substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified have well-defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank may sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful –

A Doubtful asset has all the weaknesses inherent in a Substandard asset with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.

We generally assign internal risk grades to commercial and CRE loans with commitments greater than

$1 million

based on financial and statistical models, individual credit analysis, and loan officer experience and judgment. For these larger loans, we assign one of multiple grades within the Pass classification or one of the following four grades: Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Loss indicates that the outstanding balance has been charged off. We confirm our internal risk grades quarterly, or as soon as we identify information that affects the credit risk of the loan.

For consumer loans and certain small commercial and CRE loans with commitments less than or equal to

$1 million

, we generally assign internal risk grades similar to those described previously based on automated rules that depend on refreshed credit scores, payment performance, and other risk indicators. These are generally assigned either a Pass or Substandard grade and are reviewed as we identify information that might warrant a grade change.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Outstanding loan balances (accruing and nonaccruing) categorized by these credit quality classifications are summarized as follows:

Impaired Loans

Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement, including scheduled interest payments. If a nonaccrual loan has a balance greater than

$1 million

, or if a loan is a TDR, including TDRs that subsequently default, or if the loan is no longer reported as a TDR, we individually evaluate the loan for



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

impairment and estimate a specific reserve for the loan for all portfolio segments under applicable accounting guidance. Smaller nonaccrual loans are pooled for ALLL estimation purposes.

When a loan is impaired, we estimate a specific reserve for the loan based on the projected present value of the loan’s future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the loan’s underlying collateral. The process of estimating future cash flows also incorporates the same determining factors discussed previously under nonaccrual loans. When we base the impairment amount on the fair value of the loan’s underlying collateral, we generally charge-off the portion of the balance that is impaired, such that these loans do not have a specific reserve in the ALLL. Payments received on impaired loans that are accruing are recognized in interest income, according to the contractual loan agreement. Payments received on impaired loans that are on nonaccrual are not recognized in interest income, but are applied as a reduction to the principal outstanding.

Modified and Restructured Loans

Loans may be modified in the normal course of business for competitive reasons or to strengthen the Bank’s position. Loan modifications and restructurings may also occur when the borrower experiences financial difficulty and needs temporary or permanent relief from the original contractual terms of the loan. Loans that have been modified to accommodate a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties, and for which the Bank has granted a concession that it would not otherwise consider, are considered TDRs.

We consider many factors in determining whether to agree to a loan modification involving concessions, and seek a solution that will both minimize potential loss to the Bank and attempt to help the borrower. We evaluate borrowers’ current and forecasted future cash flows, their ability and willingness to make current contractual or proposed modified payments, the value of the underlying collateral (if applicable), the possibility of obtaining additional security or guarantees, and the potential costs related to a repossession or foreclosure and the subsequent sale of the collateral.

TDRs are classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. A loan on nonaccrual and restructured as a TDR will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower has proven the ability to perform under the modified structure for a minimum of

six

months, and there is evidence that such payments can and are likely to continue as agreed. Performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual at the time of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan. A TDR loan that specifies an interest rate that at the time of the restructuring is greater than or equal to the rate the Bank is willing to accept for a new loan with comparable risk may not be reported as a TDR or an impaired loan in the calendar years subsequent to the restructuring if it is in compliance with its modified terms.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a borrower, guarantor, or another obligor to fully perform under the terms of a credit-related contract. Credit risks (whether on- or off-balance sheet) may occur when individual borrowers, groups of borrowers, or counterparties have similar economic characteristics, including industries, geographies, collateral types, sponsors, etc., and are similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Credit risk also includes the loss that would be recognized subsequent to the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted. See Note


for a discussion of counterparty risk associated with the Bank’s derivative transactions.

We perform an ongoing analysis of our loan portfolio to evaluate whether there is any significant exposure to any concentrations of credit risk. Based on this analysis, we believe that the loan portfolio is generally well diversified; however, there are certain significant concentrations in CRE and oil and gas-related lending. Further, we cannot guarantee that we have fully understood or mitigated all risk concentrations or correlated risks. We have adopted and adhere to concentration limits on various types of CRE lending, particularly construction and land development lending, leveraged and enterprise value lending, municipal lending, and oil and gas-related lending. All of these limits are continually monitored and revised as necessary.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Objectives

The Bank maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that actively incorporates the use of interest rate derivatives including unleveraged interest rate swaps, purchased options, combinations of options, and may include futures and other forward interest rate contracts. The Bank’s objective for using derivatives is to manage risks, primarily interest rate risk. The Bank uses derivatives to manage volatility in interest income, interest expense, earnings, and capital by adjusting our interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. Derivatives are used to stabilize forecasted interest receipts from variable-rate assets and to modify the coupon or the duration of fixed-rate financial assets or liabilities as we consider advisable.

We also provide certain borrowers access to over-the-counter interest rate derivatives by selling interest rate derivatives to our customers, which we generally offset with interest rate derivatives executed with other dealers or central clearing houses. The Bank also provides commercial clients short-term foreign currency spot trades or forward contracts with a maturity of generally 90 days or less that are also largely offset by foreign currency trades with closely mirroring terms executed with other dealer counterparties or central clearing houses.

We apply hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes as subsequently described in more detail. However, we do not apply hedge accounting to all the derivatives involved in our risk management activities. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are not speculative and are used to economically manage our exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks, including offsetting customer-facing derivatives. These derivatives either do not require the use of hedge accounting for their economic impact to be accurately reflected in our financial statements or they do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements.

Accounting

We record all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in Other Assets or Other Liabilities regardless of the accounting designation of each derivative. The Bank enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements, or similar agreements, with substantially all derivative counterparties. See Note


, “Offsetting Assets and Liabilities” for more information. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Bank, in the event of default or the triggering of other specified contingent events by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Bank does not offset derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement and reports all derivatives on a gross fair value basis. Note 3 discusses the process to estimate fair value for derivatives. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting accounting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments attributable to interest rates or other eligible risks, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

Fair Value Hedges

- For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings together with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to the risk being hedged. The Bank reports the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same Consolidated Income Statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported, generally Interest Income or Expense for hedges of interest rate risk of an interest-bearing financial asset or liability. The amounts from the derivative and hedged item for active fair value hedges and the location where they are recorded are detailed in the schedules below.

We currently have one active fair value hedging strategy that is a hedge of the change in fair value of LIBOR benchmark swap rate component of the contractual coupon cash flows of the Bank’s long-term debt. The objective of the hedge is to manage to the interest rate risk associated with changes in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate for $500 million of fixed-rate bonds issued in August of 2018 and subsequently hedged in September 2018. The swap and bonds mature concurrently in August of 2021. All debt basis adjustments from previously designed fair value



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

hedges were fully amortized prior to 2018. The Bank’s existing fair value interest rate hedge is expected to be perfectly effective because the critical terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item match.

Cash flow hedges

- For derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges ineffectiveness is not measured or separately disclosed. The entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred in OCI until the hedged transaction affects earnings, at which point amounts deferred in OCI are reclassified to earnings and reported in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item or forecasted transactions. We use interest rate swaps, options and combination of options in our cash flow hedging strategy to eliminate or reduce the variable cash flows associated primarily with floating-rate commercial loans due to changes in any separately identifiable and reliably measurable contractual interest rate index. The Bank had 23 interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in existence during 2018. Of these 23, six of the swaps matured during the 2018 fiscal year. The Bank has 17 interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges as of

December 31, 2018

. These swaps have an aggregate notional amount of approximately $688 million and a weighted average maturity of approximately 1.3 years and a weighted average received-fixed strike rate of approximately 1.59%. We use these receive-fixed and pay-floating rate interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges of the variable-rate interest receipts of certain pools of loan assets.

We expect to replace the maturing cash flow hedges and potentially increase cash flow hedging to reduce asset-sensitivity and exposure to falling interest rates throughout 2019. Replacement hedges will likely be a combination of received-fixed and pay-floating interest rate swaps and purchased floors, or combinations of purchased floors and other sold options to help offset the cost of the purchased floors’ premium.

During 2016 we closed our branch in Grand Cayman, Grand Cayman Islands B.W.I. and no longer have foreign operations.

No

derivatives were designated as hedges of investments in foreign operations during


.

We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows on the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows on the designated hedged item or transaction for the risk being hedged. For derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The remaining basis adjustments recorded to hedged items in fair value hedging relationships as well as any amounts remaining in AOCI for hedging relationships terminated prior to the maturity date documented in the hedge designation are accreted or amortized to interest income or expense over the originally designated period of the hedging relationship for cash flow hedges as the hedged transactions affect earnings or to the contractual maturity dates of the hedged items in fair value hedges.

Collateral and Credit Risk

Exposure to credit risk arises from the possibility of nonperformance by counterparties. No significant losses on derivative instruments have occurred as a result of counterparty nonperformance. Financial institutions which are well-capitalized and well-established are the counterparties for those derivatives entered into for asset-liability management and to offset derivatives sold to our customers. The Bank reduces its counterparty exposure for derivative contracts by centrally clearing all eligible derivatives.

For those derivatives that are not centrally cleared, the counterparties are typically financial institutions or customers of the Bank. For those that are financial institutions, as noted above, we manage our credit exposure through the use of a Credit Support Annex (“CSA”) to an ISDA master agreement with each counterparty. Eligible collateral types are documented by the CSA and controlled under the Bank’s general credit policies. Collateral balances are typically monitored on a daily basis. A valuation haircut policy reflects the fact that collateral may fall in value between the date the collateral is called and the date of liquidation or enforcement. In practice, all of the Bank’s collateral held as credit risk mitigation under a CSA is cash.

We offer interest rate swaps to our customers to assist them in managing their exposure to changing interest rates. Upon issuance, all of these customer swaps are immediately offset through closely matching derivative contracts, such that the Bank minimizes its interest rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Most of these customers do not have the capability for centralized clearing. Therefore, we manage the credit risk through loan underwriting which includes a credit risk exposure formula for the swap, the same collateral and guarantee



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

protection applicable to the loan and credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures. Fee income from customer swaps is included in other service charges, commissions and fees. Nevertheless, the related credit risk is considered and measured when and where appropriate. See Notes


and


for further discussion of our underwriting, collateral requirements, and other procedures used to address credit risk.

Our non-customer facing derivative contracts generally require us to pledge collateral for derivatives that are in a net liability position at a given balance sheet date. Certain of these derivative contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that include the requirement to maintain a minimum debt credit rating. We may be required to pledge additional collateral if a credit-risk-related feature were triggered, such as a downgrade of our credit rating. However, in past situations, not all counterparties have demanded that additional collateral be pledged when provided for under their contracts. At

December 31, 2018

, the fair value of our derivative liabilities was

$39 million

, for which we were required to pledge cash collateral of approximately

$45 million

in the normal course of business. If our credit rating were downgraded one notch by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s at December 31, 2018, there would likely be no additional collateral required to be pledged. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, all newly eligible derivatives entered into are cleared through a central clearinghouse. Derivatives that are centrally cleared do not have credit-risk-related features that require additional collateral if our credit rating were downgraded.

REGULATORY MATTERS

We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory – and possibly additional discretionary – actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Required capital levels are also subject to judgmental review by regulators.

In 2013, the FRB, FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) published final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework, commonly referred to as Basel III, for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III capital rules became effective for the Bank on January 1, 2015 and were subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components. In November 2017, the FRB, FDIC and OCC published a final rule for non-advanced approaches banks that extends the regulatory capital treatment applicable during 2017 under the regulatory capital rules for certain items. We met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules as of December 31, 2018.

Under prior Basel I capital standards, the effects of AOCI items included in capital were excluded for purposes of determining regulatory capital and capital ratios. As a “non-advanced approaches banking organization,” we made a one-time permanent election as of January 1, 2015 to continue to exclude these items, as allowed under the Basel III Capital Rules.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined). “Well-capitalized” levels are also published as a guideline to evaluate capital positions. As of

December 31, 2018

, all capital ratios of the Bank exceeded the “well-capitalized” levels under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year may not, without the approval of the appropriate federal regulators, exceed specified criteria. When determining dividends, the Bank considers current and historical earning levels, retained earnings, and risk-based and other regulatory capital requirements and limitations.

Bank-run stress tests seek to comprehensively measure all risks to which the institution is exposed, including credit, liquidity, market, operating and other risks, the losses that could result from those risk exposures under adverse scenarios, and the institution’s resulting capital levels. These stress tests have both a qualitative and a quantitative component. The qualitative component evaluates the robustness of the Bank’s risk identification, stress risk modeling, policies, capital planning, governance processes, and other components of a Capital Adequacy Process. The quantitative process subjects the Bank’s balance sheet and other risk characteristics to stress testing by using its own models.

The actual capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the Bank under Basel III are as follows:

Basel III regulatory capital amounts and ratios for 2018 are for Zions Bancorporation, National Association.


There is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company

.

The Bank is also subject to “capital conservation buffer” regulatory requirements. When fully phased-in, the Basel III capital rules will also require the Bank to maintain a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress, composed entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and progressively increases over time, as determined by regulation. The Bank’s triggers and limits under actual conditions and baseline projections are more restrictive than the capital conservation buffer requirements.

Commitments and Guarantees

We use certain financial instruments, including derivative instruments, in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers, to reduce our own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, and to make a market in U.S. Government, agency, corporate, and municipal securities.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our initial credit evaluation of the counterparty. Types of collateral vary, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing properties.

While establishing commitments to extend credit creates credit risk, a significant portion of such commitments is expected to expire without being drawn upon. As of

Legal Matters

We are subject to litigation in court and arbitral proceedings, as well as proceedings, investigations, examinations and other actions brought or considered by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. Litigation may relate to lending, deposit and other customer relationships, vendor and contractual issues, employee matters, intellectual property matters, personal injuries and torts, regulatory and legal compliance, and other matters. While most matters relate to individual claims, we are also subject to putative class action claims and similar broader claims. Proceedings, investigations, examinations and other actions brought or considered by governmental and self-regulatory agencies may relate to our banking, investment advisory, trust, securities, and other products and services; our customers’ involvement in money laundering, fraud, securities violations and other illicit activities or our policies and practices relating to such customer activities; and our compliance with the broad range of banking, securities and other laws and regulations applicable to us. At any given time, we may be in the process of responding to subpoenas, requests for documents, data and testimony relating to such matters and engaging in discussions to resolve the matters.

As of December 31, 2018, we were subject to the following material litigation or governmental inquiries:

•

a civil suit,

Shou-En Wang v. CB&T,

brought against us in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County, Central District in April 2016. The case relates to our depositor relationships with customers who were promoters of an investment program that allegedly misappropriated investors’ funds. This case is in an early phase, with initial motion practice and discovery having been completed, with additional motion practice and expert witness phases being underway.

•

a civil suit,

McFarland as Trustee for International Manufacturing Group v. CB&T, et. al.

, brought against us in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California in May 2016. The Trustee seeks to recover loan payments previously repaid to us by our customer, International Manufacturing Group (“IMG”), alleging that IMG, along with its principal, obtained loans and made loan repayments in furtherance of an alleged Ponzi scheme. Initial motion practice has been completed and discovery is underway.

•

a civil suit,

JTS Communities, Inc. et. al v. CB&T, Jun Enkoji and Dawn Satow

, brought against us in the Superior Court for Sacramento County, California in June 2017. In this case four investors in IMG seek to hold us liable for losses arising from their investments in that company, alleging that we conspired with and knowingly assisted IMG and its principal in furtherance of an alleged Ponzi Scheme. Initial motion practice has been completed and discovery is underway.

•

a civil class action lawsuit,

Evans v. CB&T

, brought against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California in May 2017. This case was filed on behalf of a class of up to 50 investors in IMG and seeks to hold us liable for losses of class members arising from their investments in IMG, alleging that we conspired with and knowingly assisted IMG and its principal in furtherance of an alleged Ponzi Scheme. In December 2017, the District Court dismissed all claims against the Bank. In January 2018, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The appellate briefing process has been completed with a ruling anticipated in 2019.

•

a Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) claim under California law,

Lawson v. CB&T

, brought against us in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego, California, in February 2016. In this case, the plaintiff alleges, on behalf of herself and other current or former employees of the Bank who worked in California on a non-exempt basis, violations by the Bank of California wage and hour laws. The case remains in the early stages of motion practice, to date mainly involving questions of venue and scope of employees covered by the PAGA claims. In March 2018, the Supreme Court of California granted review of an appeal from the intermediate appellate court decision requiring all aspects of the case to be heard in state court, rather than in arbitration. The appellate briefing process has been completed with a ruling anticipated in 2019.

•

a civil case,

Lifescan Inc. and Johnson & Johnson Health Care Services v. Jeffrey Smith, et al.

, brought against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in December 2017. In this case, certain



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

manufacturers and distributors of medical products seek to hold us liable for allegedly fraudulent practices of a borrower of the Bank which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017. The case is in early phase, with initial motion practice and discovery underway.

•

a civil class action lawsuit,

Gregory, et. al. v. Zions Bancorporation

, was brought against us in the United States District Court in Utah in January 2019. This case was filed on behalf of investors in Rust Rare Coin, Inc. alleging that we aided and abetted a Ponzi scheme fraud perpetrated by Rust Rare Coin, a Zions Bank customer. This case follows civil actions and the establishment of a receivership for Rust Rare Coin by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Utah Division of Securities in November 2018, as well as a separate suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Rust Rare Coin and its principal Gaylen Rust.

At least quarterly, we review outstanding and new legal matters, utilizing then available information. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, if we determine that a loss from a matter is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish an accrual for the loss. In the absence of such a determination, no accrual is made. Once established, accruals are adjusted to reflect developments relating to the matters.

In our review, we also assess whether we can determine the range of reasonably possible losses for significant matters in which we are unable to determine that the likelihood of a loss is remote. Because of the difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, discussed subsequently, we are able to meaningfully estimate such a range only for a limited number of matters. Based on information available as of December 31, 2018, we estimated that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses for those matters to be from

$0 million

to roughly

$50 million

in excess of amounts accrued. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. Those matters for which a meaningful estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range and, therefore, this estimated range does not represent our maximum loss exposure.

Based on our current knowledge, we believe that our current estimated liability for litigation and other legal actions and claims, reflected in our accruals and determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, is adequate and that liabilities in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, arising from litigation and other legal actions and claims for which an estimate as previously described is possible, will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in light of the significant uncertainties involved in these matters, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows for any given reporting period.

Any estimate or determination relating to the future resolution of litigation, arbitration, governmental or self-regulatory examinations, investigations or actions or similar matters is inherently uncertain and involves significant judgment. This is particularly true in the early stages of a legal matter, when legal issues and facts have not been well articulated, reviewed, analyzed, and vetted through discovery, preparation for trial or hearings, substantive and productive mediation or settlement discussions, or other actions. It is also particularly true with respect to class action and similar claims involving multiple defendants, matters with complex procedural requirements or substantive issues or novel legal theories, and examinations, investigations and other actions conducted or brought by governmental and self-regulatory agencies, in which the normal adjudicative process is not applicable. Accordingly, we usually are unable to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is remote, reasonably likely, or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss, until relatively late in the course of a legal matter, sometimes not until a number of years have elapsed. Accordingly, our judgments and estimates relating to claims will change from time to time in light of developments and actual outcomes will differ from our estimates. These differences may be material.

Related Party Transactions

We have no material related party transactions requiring disclosure. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiary bank extend credit to related parties, including executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their associates and related interests. These related party loans are made in compliance with applicable banking regulations.

16. REVENUE RECOGNITION

Adoption of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

On January 1, 2018, we adopted the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts with customers for which the performance obligations were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition.” Upon adoption, the Bank has elected to use the following optional exemptions that are permitted under the Topic 606, which have been applied consistently to all contracts within all reporting periods presented:

•

The Bank recognizes the incremental cost of obtaining a contract as an expense, when incurred, if the amortization period of the asset that the Bank would have recognized is one year or less.

•

For performance obligations satisfied over time, if the Bank has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Bank’s performance completed to date, the Bank will generally recognize revenue in the amount to which the Bank has a right to invoice.

•

The Bank does not generally disclose information about its remaining performance obligations for those performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less, or where the Bank recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Bank has a right to invoice.

The cumulative effect of adopting Topic 606 did not have a material impact to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in changes to our accounting policies, business processes, and internal controls to support the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements under Topic 606.

Revenue Recognition

We derive our revenue primarily from interest income on loans and securities, which was more than three-quarters of our revenue for


, and is out of scope of ASC 606. Only noninterest income is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers in scope of ASC 606. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The following is a description of revenue from contracts with customers:

Service charges and fees on deposit accounts

Service charges and fees on deposit accounts typically consist of fees charged for providing customers with deposit services. These fees are primarily comprised of account analysis fees, insufficient funds fees, and other various fees on deposit accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts include fees earned in lieu of compensating balances, and fees earned for performing cash management services and other deposit account services. Service charges on deposit accounts in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided. Treasury Management fees are billed monthly based on services rendered for the month.

Other Service charges, commissions, and fees

Other service charges, commissions, and fees primarily consist of credit and debit card interchange fees, automated teller machine (“ATM”) services, and various account services such as wires, safe deposit box, check issuance and cashing services. Revenue is recognized as the services are rendered or upon completion of services.

The Bank’s card fee income includes interchange income from credit and debit cards and net fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is recognized as earned. Reward program costs are recorded when the rewards are earned by the customer and presented as a reduction to interchange income.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The major income categories within “Other Service charges, commissions and fees” that are in scope of ASC 606 are summarized as follows:

Wealth management and trust income

Wealth management and trust income is comprised of a variety of products, including but not limited to: corporate and personal trust income, wealth management commissions, portfolio services, and advisory services. Revenue is recognized as the services are rendered or upon completion of services. Financial planning and estate services typically have performance obligations that are greater than 12 months, although the amount of future performance obligations are not significant.

Capital markets and foreign exchange

Capital markets and foreign exchange fees primarily consist of mutual fund distribution fees, municipal advisory services, and foreign exchange services provided to customers. Revenue is recognized as the services are rendered or upon completion of services.

Other noninterest income from contracts with customers

Other noninterest income from customers primarily consists of trust operations outsourcing and other various income streams. Revenue is recognized as the services are rendered or upon completion of services.

Disaggregation of Revenue

We provide services across different geographical areas, primarily in 11 Western U.S. States, under banking operations that have their own individual brand names, including Zions Bank, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, National Bank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and The Commerce Bank of Washington. The operating segment listed as “Other” includes certain nonbank financial services subsidiaries, centralized back-office functions, and eliminations of transactions between the segments.

Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, noninterest income and net revenue by operating segments for 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:

Revenue from contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities. Contract receivables are included in Other Assets. Payment terms vary by services offered, and the timing between completion of performance obligations and payment is typically not significant.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans

Pension –

This qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan is frozen to new participation. No service-related benefits have been accrued since July 1, 2013. All participants in the Plan are currently 100% vested in their benefits. Plan assets consist principally of corporate equity securities, mutual fund investments, real estate, and fixed income investments. Plan benefits are paid as a lump-sum cash value or an annuity at retirement age. Contributions to the plan are based on actuarial recommendation and pension regulations.

There was no minimum regulatory contribution required in 2018 and 2017. Currently, it is expected tha

t

no

m

inimum regulatory contributions will be required in


.

In October 2018, the Bank decided to terminate its pension plan subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approval. Completion of this termination is expected in early 2020. Plan participant benefits will not be disadvantaged because of this decision.

Supplemental Retirement

–

These unfunded nonqualified plans are for certain current and former employees. Each year, Bank contributions to these plans are made in amounts sufficient to meet benefit payments to plan participants.

Postretirement Medical/Life

–

This unfunded health care and life insurance plan provides postretirement medical benefits to certain full-time employees who meet minimum age and service requirements. The plan also provides specified life insurance benefits to certain employees. The plan is contributory with retiree contributions adjusted annually, and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. Plan coverage is provided by self-funding or health maintenance organization options. Our contribution towards the retiree medical premium has been permanently frozen at an amount that does not increase in any future year. Retirees pay the difference between the full premium rates and our capped contribution.

Because our contribution rate is capped, there is no effect on the postretirement plan from assumed increases or decreases in health care cost trends. Each year, Bank contributions to the plan are made in amounts sufficient to meet the portion of the premiums that are the Bank’s responsibility.



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following presents the change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of plan assets, and funded status, of the plans and amounts recognized in the balance sheet as of the measurement date of December 31:

The pension asset and the liability for supplement retirement/postretirement benefits are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the balance sheet. The accumulated benefit obligation is the same as the benefit obligation shown in the preceding schedule. During the third quarter of 2017, the Bank revised its pension plan to offer certain participants a temporary opportunity to make an election to receive an immediate distribution from the pension plan. The window was available between August 1, 2017 and November 24, 2017. The impact of these distributions is included in “benefits paid” in the preceding schedule and in “settlement loss” shown in the net period benefit cost (credit) schedule.

The amounts in AOCI (loss) at

expected to be recognized as an expense component of net periodic benefit cost in


for the plans are estimated as follows:

The following presents the components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the plans:



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Weighted average assumptions based on the pension plan are the same where applicable for each of the plans and are as follows:

The discount rate reflects the yields available on long-term, high-quality fixed income debt instruments with cash flows similar to the obligations of the pension plan, and is reset annually on the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a review of the target asset allocation of the plan. This rate is intended to approximate the long-term rate of return that we anticipate receiving on the plan’s investments, considering the mix of the assets that the plan holds as investments, the expected return on these underlying investments, the diversification of these investments, and the rebalancing strategies employed. An expected long-term rate of return is assumed for each asset class and an underlying inflation rate assumption is determined.

Benefit payments to the plans’ participants are estimated in the following schedule for the years succeeding

December 31, 2018

. If the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, and the pension plan is terminated, there would not be payments made by the Bank to plan participants after termination of the plan.

We are also obligated under other supplemental retirement plans for certain current and former employees. Our liability for these plans was

$5 million

and

$6 million

at December 31,


and


, respectively.

For the pension plan, the investment strategy is predicated on its investment objectives and the risk and return expectations of asset classes appropriate for the plan. Investment objectives have been established by considering the plan’s liquidity needs and time horizon and the fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The asset allocation strategy is developed to meet the plan’s long-term needs in a manner designed to control volatility and to reflect risk tolerance. Target investment allocation percentages as of

December 31, 2018

are

9%

in equity,

88%

in fixed income and cash, and

3%

in real estate assets. During the second quarter of 2018 the asset allocation was changed from primarily equity focused to fixed income focused.

The following presents the fair values of pension plan investments according to the fair value hierarchy described in Note


, and the weighted average allocations:



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

In addition to the investments listed in the previous schedule, as of

December 31, 2018

in equity investments, and

$116 million

in debt investments, which are in pooled separate accounts, as well as

.

The following describes the pension plan investments and the valuation methodologies used to measure their fair value:

Bank common stock – Shares of the Bank’s common stock are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the plan year in the active market where individual securities are traded.

Mutual funds – These funds are valued at quoted market prices which represent the NAVs of shares held by the plan at year-end.

Insurance company pooled separate accounts – These funds are invested in by more than one investor. They are offered through separate accounts of the trustee’s insurance company and managed by internal and professional advisors. Participation units in these accounts are valued at the NAV as the practical expedient for fair value as determined by the insurance company.

Guaranteed deposit account – This account is a group annuity product issued by the trustee’s insurance company with guaranteed crediting rates established at the beginning of each calendar year. The account balance is stated at fair value as estimated by the trustee. The account is credited with deposits made, plus earnings at guaranteed crediting rates, less withdrawals and administrative expenses. The underlying investments generally include investment-grade public and privately traded debt securities, mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, real estate and other equity investments. Market value adjustments are applied at the time of redemption if certain withdrawal limits are exceeded.

Additional fair value quantitative information for the guaranteed deposit account is as follows:

The Bank’s Benefits Committee evaluates the methodology and factors used, including review of the contract, economic conditions, industry and market developments, and overall credit ratings of the underlying investments.

Limited partnerships – These partnerships invest in limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or similar investment vehicles that consist of PEIs in a wide variety of investment types, including venture and growth capital, real estate, energy and natural resources, and other private investments. The plan’s investments are valued by the limited partnerships at NAV as the practical expedient for fair value. The estimation process takes into account the plan’s proportional interests credited with realized and unrealized earnings from the underlying investments and charged for operating expenses and distributions. Investments are increased by capital calls and are part of an overall capital commitment by the plan of up to approximately

$9 million

at

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We have a share-based compensation incentive plan which allows us to grant stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, and other awards to employees and non-employee directors. Total shares authorized under the plan were

9,000,000

at

December 31, 2018

, of which

4,407,113

were available for future grants.

All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of income based on their grant date values. The value of an equity award is estimated on the grant date using a fair value-based model without regard to service or performance vesting conditions, but does consider post-vesting restrictions.

We classify all share-based awards as equity instruments. Compensation expense is included in salaries and employee benefits in the statement of income, with the corresponding increase included in additional-paid-in-



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

capital. Substantially all awards of stock options, restricted stock, and RSUs have graded vesting that is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Compensation expense and the related tax benefit for all share-based awards were as follows:

During 2017, as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the tax effects recognized from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs was recorded as a

$9 million

reduction of income tax expense. Income tax was reduced by

$8 million

during 2018 as a result of applying this new accounting standard. Also, upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, we elected to account for forfeitures of share-based compensation awards as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as was previously done. There was no material impact from the cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings from this change.

Prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the tax effects recognized from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSUs increased common stock by approximately

$2 million

in 2016. This amount is included in the net activity under employee plans and related tax benefits in the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity.

During both 2018 and 2017, we reduced share-based compensation expense by

$1 million

as a result of using a valuation model to estimate a liquidity discount on RSUs with post-vesting restrictions.

As of

December 31, 2018

, compensation expense not yet recognized for nonvested share-based awards was approximately

$25 million

, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

2.4

years.

Stock Options

Stock options granted to employees generally vest at the rate of one third each year and expire seven years after the date of grant. For all stock options granted in


,


, and


, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date value of stock options in determining compensation expense. The following summarizes the weighted average value at grant date and the significant assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes model for options granted:

The assumptions for expected dividend yield, expected volatility, and expected life reflect management’s judgment and include consideration of historical experience. Expected volatility is based in part on historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock is common stock with certain restrictions that relate to trading and the possibility of forfeiture. Generally, restricted stock vests over four years. Holders of restricted stock have full voting rights and receive dividend equivalents during the vesting period. In addition, holders of restricted stock can make an election to be subject to income tax on the grant date rather than the vesting date.

RSUs represent rights to one share of common stock for each unit and generally vest over four years. Holders of RSUs receive dividend equivalents during the vesting period, but do not have voting rights.

Compensation expense is determined based on the number of restricted shares or RSUs granted and the market price of our common stock at the issue date.

During 2018, 2017, and 2016, we granted

14,796

,

20,711

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (“DTA”) and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), was signed into law. The Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. In conjunction with the enactment of the Act, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act that may not be complete by the time financial statements are issued. The Bank evaluated all available information and made reasonable estimates of the impact of the Act to substantially all components of its net DTA. The provisional impact of the Act on the net DTA resulted in a non-cash charge of

$47 million

recorded through income tax expense in 2017 related to items such as foregone interest, equity investments in flow-through entities, certain employee compensation arrangements, FDIC-supported transactions and premises and equipment.

During 2018 after filing its 2017 federal and state tax returns, the Bank finalized its analysis of all net DTAs that existed at December 31, 2017 and made a

$2 million

tax benefit adjustment on net DTAs as a result of the Act. This adjustment offset the provisional amount of

$47 million

recognized in 2017 to deferred tax expense, resulting in an overall adjustment of

$45 million

to net DTAs from the Act. The Bank complied with the requirements of SAB 118 as all impacts of the Act were recognized in the financial statements prior to December 22, 2018.

, the Bank early adopted the guidance in ASU 2018-02, which allows reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects related to the change in the corporate income tax rate from the Act. The early adoption of the guidance resulted in a

$25 million

increase to retained earnings out of AOCI as of December 31, 2017.

The amount of net DTAs is included with other assets in the balance sheet. The less than

$1 million

and

$2 million

valuation allowances at

December 31, 2018

and


, respectively, were for certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards included in our acquisition of the remaining interests in a less significant subsidiary. At

ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES


, excluding the less than

$1 million

valuation allowance, the tax effect of remaining net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards was

$2 million

expiring through


.

We evaluate the DTAs on a regular basis to determine whether an additional valuation allowance is required. In conducting this evaluation, we have considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, based on the more likely than not criteria that such assets will be realized. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to: (1) available carryback potential to prior tax years; (2) potential future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, which historically have a reversal pattern generally consistent with DTAs; (3) potential tax planning strategies; and (4) future projected taxable income. Based on this evaluation, and considering the weight of the positive evidence compared to the negative evidence, we have concluded that an additional valuation allowance is not required as of

December 31, 2018

.

We have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions for tax credits on technology initiatives. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

At

December 31, 2018

and


, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included approximately

$7 million

and

$5 million

, respectively (net of the federal tax benefit on state issues) that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that may increase or decrease during the 12 months subsequent to

December 31, 2018

, is dependent on the timing and outcome of various federal and state examinations that are ongoing.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense in the statement of income. At

December 31, 2018

and


, accrued interest and penalties recognized in the balance sheet, net of any federal and/or state tax benefits, were less than

$1 million

.

The Bank files income tax returns in U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. The Bank is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to


for federal returns and


for certain state returns.

OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION

We manage our operations and prepare management reports and other information with a primary focus on geographical area. Our banking operations are managed under their own individual brand names, including Zions Bank, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, National Bank of Arizona, Nevada State Bank, Vectra Bank Colorado, and The Commerce Bank of Washington. Performance assessment and resource allocation are based upon this geographical structure. We use an internal funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) allocation system to report results of operations for business segments. This process is continually refined. Total average loans and deposits presented for the banking segments include insignificant intercompany amounts between banking segments and may also include deposits with the Other segment.

As of

December 31, 2018

, our banking business is conducted through


locally managed and branded segments in distinct geographical areas. Zions Bank operates


branches in Utah,


branches in Idaho, and


branch in Wyoming. CB&T operates


branches in California. Amegy operates


branches in Texas. NBAZ operates


branches in Arizona. NSB operates


branches in Nevada. Vectra operates


branches in Colorado and


branch in New Mexico. TCBW operates


branch in Washington and


branch in Oregon.

The operating segment identified as “Other” includes certain nonbank financial service subsidiaries, centralized back-office functions, and eliminations of transactions between segments. The major components of net interest income at the Bank’s back-office include the revenue associated with the investments securities portfolio and the offset of the FTP costs and benefits provided to the business segments. Throughout 2016 consolidation efforts continued, which resulted in transitioning full-time equivalent employees from the business segments to the Bank’s



ZIONS BANCORPORATION, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

back-office units. Due to the continuing nature and timing of this change, the Bank’s back-office units retained more direct expenses in 2016 than in prior years. In the first quarter of 2017 we made changes to the FTP process and internal allocation of central expenses to better reflect the performance of business segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the impact of these changes had they been instituted in 2016.

The following schedule does not present total assets or income tax expense for each operating segment, but instead presents average loans, average deposits and income before income taxes because these are the metrics that management uses when evaluating performance and making decisions pertaining to the operating segments. The condensed statement of income identifies the components of income and expense which affect the operating amounts presented in the Other segment.

The accounting policies of the individual operating segments are the same as those of the Bank. Transactions between operating segments are primarily conducted at fair value, resulting in profits that are eliminated for reporting consolidated results of operations.

The following is a summary of selected operating segment information:
