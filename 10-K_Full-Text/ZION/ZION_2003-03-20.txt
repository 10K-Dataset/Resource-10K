PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Description of Business

Zions Bancorporation (“the Parent”) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of Utah in 1955, and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Zions Bancorporation and its
subsidiaries (“the Company”) own and operate six commercial banks with a total of 416 offices. The Company provides a full range of banking and related services through its banking and other subsidiaries, primarily in Utah, Idaho,
California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Washington. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 8,073 at year-end 2002. For further information about the Company’s industry segments, see “Business Segment Results” in Management’s
Comments and Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information about the Company’s foreign operations, see “Foreign Operations” in Management’s Comments.

Growth

While the Company’s internally generated growth remained very strong during 2002, the Company also continued to build the
business through acquisitions that complement its strategies and build on its core strengths. For information about merger activities, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Products and Services

The Company focuses on maintaining community–minded banking by strengthening its core business lines of retail
banking, small and medium–sized business lending, residential mortgage, and investment activities. It operates six different banks in eight western states; each bank operates under a different name and each has its own chief executive officer
and management team. The banks provide a wide variety of commercial and retail banking and mortgage lending products and services. The Company provides commercial loans, lease financing, cash management, lockbox, customized draft processing, and
other special financial services for business and other commercial banking customers. The Company provides a wide range of personal banking services to individuals, including bankcard, student and other installment loans and home equity lines of
credit, checking accounts, savings accounts, time certificates of various types and maturities, trust services, safe deposit facilities, direct deposit, and 24-hour ATM access. The Company also provides services to key segments through its
Women’s Financial, Private Client Services, and Executive Banking Groups.

In addition to these core businesses, the Company has built specialized lines of business in
capital markets and public finance. The Company is also a leader in U.S. Small Business Administration lending. Through its six bank subsidiaries, the Company provides SBA 7(a) loans to small businesses throughout the United States and is also one
of the largest providers of SBA 504 financing in the nation. The Company also owns an equity interest in the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and is the nation’s top originator of secondary market agricultural
real estate mortgage loans through Farmer Mac. The Company is a leader in municipal finance advisory and underwriting services. It is also a leader in the emerging electronic corporate bond trading market, and it owns an equity interest in and is
represented on the board of Garban-Intercapital plc, a London Stock Exchange listed company that is a leader in electronic securities trading in the United States. Four venture capital companies owned by the Company provide early-stage capital,
primarily for start-up companies located in the Western United States.

Competition

Zions
Bancorporation and its subsidiaries operate in a highly competitive environment due to the diverse financial services and products they offer. Competitors include not only other banks and thrift institutions, credit unions, and mutual funds, but
also insurance companies, finance companies, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory
restrictions as the Company. Most of these competitors compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in many significant products. These competitive trends are likely to
continue.

Supervision and Regulation

On July 30, 2002, the Senate and the House of Representatives
of the United States (Congress) enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law that addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.
Effective August 29, 2002, as directed by Section 302(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are each required to certify that the Company’s Quarterly and Annual Reports do not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact. The rules have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
controls; they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about internal controls; and they have included information in the Company’s Quarterly and Annual Reports about
theirevaluation and whether there have been significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation.


The Board of Directors of Zions Bancorporation has approved a series of actions to strengthen and improve its already strong corporate governance practices,
including the adoption of new Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and new charters for the Audit, Credit Review, Executive Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. More information on
Zions Bancorporation’s corporate governance practices will be available on the Zions Bancorporation website at

www.zionsbancorporation.com

.

The enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“the GLB Act”) represented a pivotal point in the history of the financial services industry. The GLB Act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework
that had its origins in the Depression Era of the 1930s. Effective March 11, 2000, new opportunities became available for banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that permit a single
financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services. The GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework through a financial holding company, which has as its umbrella regulator the Federal Reserve
Board (“FRB”). Functional regulation of the financial holding company’s separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by their primary functional regulator.

The
GLB Act provides a federal right to privacy for non-public personal information of individual customers. The Company, including its subsidiaries, is also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of nonpublic personal
information.

Zions Bancorporation is a financial holding company and, as such, is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“the BHC
Act”). The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for a financial holding company to acquire or hold more than 5% voting interest in any bank, and restricts interstate banking activities. The BHC Act allows interstate bank acquisitions
and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country.

The BHC Act restricts the Company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted for financial holding
companies or determined by the FRB to be financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or complementary to a financial activity. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding
companies. The Company’s banking subsidiaries are subject to limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates.

The Company’s banking subsidiaries are also
subject to various requirements and restrictions in the laws of the United States and in the states in which the banks operate. These include restrictions on the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates, the nature and amount of their
investments, their ability to act as an underwriter of securities, the opening of branches and the acquisition of other financial entities. The Company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act or the banking
laws of their respective states, are under the supervision of, and are subject to periodic examination by, the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) or their respective state banking departments, and are subject to the rules and regulations
of the OCC, the FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).

The FRB has established capital guidelines for financial holding companies. The OCC, the
FDIC, and the FRB have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks under federal law. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Company and its subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement
remedies. See Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding capital requirements.

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’
risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“the BIS”). The BIS is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that
develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply. In January 2001, the BIS released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new capital accord that would set
capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures. Operational risk is defined to mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events. The 1988 capital accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk. In 2002 the BIS published proposed modifications to its January 2001 proposal. While the ultimate
timing for the new accord and the specifics of capital assessments for addressing operational risk are uncertain, the BIS has stated that its objective is to finalize a new capital accord in the fourth quarter of 2003 and for member countries to
implement the new accord at year-end 2006. The Company expects that a new capital accord addressing operational risk will eventually be adopted by the BIS and implemented by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.

Dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to Zions Bancorporation are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. These restrictions and the amount available for the payment of dividends at
year-end are summarized in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 provides that the Company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred
by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety
and soundness of insured banks. These standards relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, as well as other operational
and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies.

The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires banks to help serve the credit
needs in their communities, including credit to low and moderate income individuals. Should the Company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches,
relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase other financial institutions. The GLB Act requires “satisfactory” or higher CRA compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies in
order for them to engage in new financial activities.

On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation known as the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”). Title III of the USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes
and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) has issued a number of implementing regulations which apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to
financial institutions such as the Company’s bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the Company’s subsidiaries. Those regulations impose new obligations on financial
institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. Treasury is expected to issue a number of additional regulations, which will further clarify the USA
Patriot Act’s requirements.

Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputa-tional consequences
for the institution. The Company has adopted appropriate policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies,
procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the Act and Treasury’s regulations.

Regulators and Congress continue to enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate
the financial services industry and to protect consumers. The nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.

Government Monetary Policies

The earnings and business of the Company are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by
fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities. The Company is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which affects the national supply of bank credit. The instruments and methods of monetary policy available to the
FRB include open-market operations in U.S. government securities; adjustment of the discount rates or cost of bank borrowings; imposing or changing reserve requirements against member bank deposits; and imposing or changing reserve requirements
against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for
deposits.

In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the FRB’s monetary policies, it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand, deposit
levels and interest rates, or their effect on the business and earnings of the Company. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the
future.
