PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Zions Bancorporation
(“the Parent”) is a financial holding company organized under the laws of the State of Utah in 1955, and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Zions Bancorporation and its subsidiaries
(collectively “the Company” or “Zions”) own and operate six commercial banks with a total of 387 offices at year-end 2004. The Company provides a full range of banking and related services through its banking and other
subsidiaries, primarily in Utah, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Washington. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 8,026 at year-end 2004. For further information about the Company’s industry segments, see “Business
Segment Results” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For information about the Company’s foreign operations, see “Foreign Operations”
in MD&A. The “Executive Summary” in MD&A provides further information about the Company.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The Company focuses on
maintaining community-minded banking services by continuously strengthening its core business lines of retail banking, small and medium-sized business lending, residential mortgage, and investment activities. It operates six different banks in eight
western states with each bank operating under a different name and each having its own chief executive officer and management team. The banks provide a wide variety of commercial and retail banking and mortgage lending products and services. The
Company provides commercial loans, lease financing, cash management, lockbox, customized draft processing, and other special financial services for business and other commercial banking customers. The Company also provides a wide range of personal
banking services to individuals, including home mortgages, bankcard, student and other installment loans, home equity lines of credit, checking accounts, savings accounts, time certificates of various types and maturities, trust services, safe
deposit facilities, direct deposit, and 24-hour ATM access. In addition, certain banking subsidiaries provide services to key market segments through their Women’s Financial, Private Client Services, and Executive Banking Groups.

In addition to these core businesses, the Company has built specialized lines of business in
capital markets and public finance and is also a leader in U.S. Small Business Administration lending. Through its six banking subsidiaries, the Company provides Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) loans to small businesses
throughout the United States and is also one of the largest providers of SBA 504 financing in the nation. The Company owns an equity interest in the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and is the nation’s top
originator of secondary market agricultural real estate mortgage loans through Farmer Mac. The Company is a leader in municipal finance advisory and underwriting services and also in the odd lot electronic bond trading market. Zions also controls
four venture capital companies that provide early-stage capital, primarily for start-up companies located in the Western United States.

COMPETITION

As a result of the diverse financial services and products it offers, Zions operates in a highly competitive environment. Competitors include not only other banks, thrift institutions and credit unions, but also
insurance companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Most of these entities compete across geographic boundaries
and provide customers with increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in many significant products. In addition, many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the Company. These competitive
trends are likely to continue.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

On July 30, 2002, the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States
(Congress) enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a law that addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The NASDAQ has also
proposed corporate governance rules, which intend to allow


shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors.

The Board of Directors of Zions Bancorporation has implemented a system of strong corporate
governance practices. This system included Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and charters for the Audit, Credit Review, Executive Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. More
information on Zions Bancorporation’s corporate governance practices is available on the Zions Bancorporation website at

The enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“the GLB Act”) represented a pivotal point in the history of the financial
services industry. The GLB Act swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the Depression Era of the 1930s. Effective March 11, 2000, new opportunities became available for banks, other depository institutions, insurance
companies and securities firms to enter into business combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer customers a more complete array of financial products and services. The GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework
through a financial holding company, which has as its umbrella regulator the Federal Reserve Board (“FRB”). The functional regulation of the separately regulated subsidiaries of a holding company is conducted by the subsidiary’s
primary functional regulator. To qualify for and maintain status as a financial holding company, a company must satisfy certain ongoing criteria.

The GLB Act also provides federal regulations dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of individual customers, which the Company and its subsidiaries must
comply with. In addition, the Company, including its subsidiaries, is subject to various state laws that deal with the use and distribution of nonpublic personal information.

The Parent is a financial holding company and, as such, is subject to the BHC Act. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for a
financial holding company to acquire or hold more than 5% voting interest in any bank. The BHC Act allows, subject to certain limitations, interstate bank acquisitions and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country.

The BHC Act restricts the Company’s nonbanking activities to those that are permitted
for financial holding companies or that have been determined by the FRB to be financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or complementary to a financial activity. The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of
nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies. The Company’s banking subsidiaries, however, are subject to limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates.

The Company’s banking subsidiaries are also subject to various requirements and restrictions in both the laws of the United States and
the states in which the banks operate. These include:

•

restrictions on the amount of loans to a borrower and its affiliates;

•

the nature and amount of any investments;

•

their ability to act as an underwriter of securities;

•

the opening of branches; and

•

the acquisition of other financial entities.

In addition, the Company’s subsidiary banks are subject to either the provisions of the National Bank Act or the banking laws of their respective states, as well as
the rules and regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the FRB, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). They are also under the supervision of, and are subject to periodic examination by, the OCC or
their respective state banking departments, the FRB, and the FDIC.

The FRB has
established capital guidelines for financial holding companies. The OCC, the FDIC, and the FRB have also issued regulations establishing capital requirements for banks. Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Company and its
subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding capital requirements.

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (the “BIS”). The BIS is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines that each country’s supervisors can use to
determine the supervisory policies they apply. In January 2001, the BIS released a proposal to replace the 1988 accord with a new capital framework that would set capital requirements for operational risk and materially change the existing capital
requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures. Operational risk is defined by the proposal to


mean the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The 1988 accord
does not include separate capital requirements for operational risk.

In
January 2005, the U.S. banking regulators issued an interagency statement with regard to the U.S. implementation of the Basel II Framework. They have set January 2008 as the effective date for the final regulations, with mid-year 2006 for the
publication of the final rule. The regulators have previously stated that approximately the ten largest U.S. bank holding companies will be required to adopt the new standard, and that others may elect to “opt in.” We do not currently
expect to be an early “opt in” bank holding company, as the Company does not have in place the data collection and analytical capabilities necessary to adopt Basel II. However, we believe that the competitive advantages afforded to
companies that do adopt the framework will make it necessary for the Company to elect to “opt in” at some point, and we have begun investing in the required capabilities.

Dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to the Parent are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. These restrictions and the
amount available for the payment of dividends at year-end are summarized in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 provides that the Company’s bank subsidiaries are liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC
in connection with the failure of an affiliated insured bank.

The Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of insured banks. These standards relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit
underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies.

The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including credit to low
and moderate income individuals. Should the Company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with
or purchase other financial institutions. The GLB Act requires “satisfactory” or higher CRA compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding companies for them to engage in new financial activities. If one of the
Company’s banks should receive a CRA rating of less than satisfactory, the Company could lose its status as a financial holding company.

On October 26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “USA Patriot Act”). Title
III of the USA Patriot Act substantially broadens the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, defining new crimes and related penalties, and expanding the
extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department (“the Treasury”) has issued a number of implementation regulations, which apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. The
Company’s bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries and mutual funds and private investment companies advised or sponsored by the Company’s subsidiaries must comply with these regulations. These regulations also impose new obligations on
financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing.

Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The
Company has adopted appropriate policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to
reflect changes required by the Act and the Treasury’s regulations.

Regulators and Congress continue to enact rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to protect consumers. The nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and
earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES

The earnings and business of the Company are affected not only by general
economic conditions, but also by fiscal and other policies adopted by various governmental authorities. The Company is particularly affected by the policies of the


FRB, which affects the national supply of bank credit. The methods of monetary policy available to the FRB include:

•

open-market operations in U.S. government securities;

•

adjustment of the discount rates or cost of bank borrowings;

•

imposing or changing reserve requirements against member bank deposits; and

•

imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.

These methods are used in varying combinations to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans, investments and deposits, and
the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.

In view of the
changing conditions in the economy and the effect of the FRB’s monetary policies, it is difficult to predict future changes in loan demand, deposit levels and interest rates, or their effect on the business and earnings of the Company. FRB
monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
