ITEM I.  BUSINESS

Forward-Looking
Information

Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
that are not based on historical data are forward-looking, including, for
example, the projected performance of the Company and its operations.  These statements constitute forward-looking
information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995.  Actual results may differ
materially from the projections discussed in Management’s Comments since such
projections involve significant risks and uncertainties.  Factors that might cause such differences
include, but are not limited to: the timing of closing proposed acquisitions
being delayed or such acquisitions being prohibited; competitive pressures
among financial institutions increasing significantly; economic conditions,
either nationally or locally in areas in which the Company conducts its
operations, being less favorable than expected; and legislation or regulatory
changes which adversely affect the Company’s operations or business.  The Company disclaims any obligation to
update any factors or to publicly announce the result of revisions to any of
the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or
developments.

Description of Business

Zions Bancorporation (“the Parent”) is a
financial holding company organized under the laws of Utah in 1955, and
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.  Zions Bancorporation and its Subsidiaries
(“the Company”) own and operate six commercial banks with a total of 413
offices.  The Company provides a full
range of banking and related services through its banking and other
subsidiaries, primarily in Utah, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado
and Washington. On December 31, 2001, the Company had total assets of
approximately $24.3 billion, loans of $17.3 billion, deposits of $17.8 billion
and shareholders’ equity of $2.3 billion. 
Active full-time equivalent employees totaled 8,124 at year-end 2001.  For further information about the Company’s
industry segments, see “Business Segment Results” in Management’s Comments and
Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  All the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and references to Management’s Comments, referred to in this Form
10-K, are included in the Company’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders
incorporated by reference herein.

Growth

While the Company’s internally generated
growth remained very strong during 2001, the Company also continued to build
the business through acquisitions of banks and other companies that complement
its strategies and build on its core strengths.

In November 2001, the Company acquired
Minnequa Bancorp headquartered in Pueblo, Colorado, and its banking subsidiary,
Minnequa Bank of Pueblo, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase.  Minnequa Bank, with assets of $336 million,
was merged into the Company’s Vectra Bank Colorado subsidiary.

In April 2001, the Company acquired nine
Arizona branches of Pacific Century Bank, a subsidiary of Pacific Century
Financial Corporation. The Company purchased $231 million in


loans, assumed $447 million in deposits,
acquired branch facilities with the accompanying personnel, and received cash
to satisfy assumed deposits.

In March 2001, the Company acquired Eldorado
Bancshares, Inc., headquartered in Laguna Hills, California, and its banking
subsidiaries, Eldorado Bank and Antelope Valley Bank in a transaction accounted
for as a purchase.  Eldorado Bank and
Antelope Valley Bank, with combined assets of 
$1.3 billion, were merged into the Company’s California Bank & Trust
subsidiary.

In January 2001, the Company acquired Draper
Bancorp, based in Draper, Utah, and its banking subsidiary, Draper Bank.  The acquisition was accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method and was not considered material to the historical
results of the Company and, accordingly, the Company’s financial statements
were not restated. Draper Bank, with assets of $242 million, was merged into
the Company’s Zions First National Bank subsidiary.

In July 2001, the Company also acquired three
companies providing e-commerce solutions. 
The Company acquired Internet Commerce Express, Inc., headquartered in
Nashua, New Hampshire; ThinkXML, Inc., headquartered in Rockville, Maryland;
and Frontier Technologies Corporation (asset purchase only), headquartered in
Mequon, Wisconsin.  They were
subsequently merged into Internet Commerce Express, Inc., and in October 2001,
the name was changed to Lexign, Inc.

On July 28, 2000, the Company completed the
acquisition of County Bank headquartered in Prescott, Arizona.  County Bank, with assets of approximately
$247 million, was merged into the Company’s National Bank of Arizona
subsidiary. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and was
not considered material to the historical results of the Company and,
accordingly, the Company’s financial statements were not restated.

In October 1999, the Company acquired Pioneer
Bancorporation headquartered in Reno, Nevada, and its wholly-owned subsidiary
Pioneer Citizens Bank of Nevada, in a transaction accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests.  Pioneer Citizens
Bank of Nevada, with total assets of approximately $1 billion on September 30,
1999, was merged into Nevada State Bank. 
Also in October 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of Regency
Bancorp headquartered in Fresno, California and its banking subsidiary Regency
Bank, in a purchase transaction.  On
September 30, 1999, Regency Bank had total assets of approximately $230
million.  Regency Bank was merged into
the Company’s banking subsidiary, California Bank & Trust.

For further information about merger
activities, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Products
and Services

The Company focuses on maintaining
community-minded banking by strengthening its core business lines of retail
banking, small and medium-sized business lending, residential mortgage, and
investment activities. The banks provide a wide variety of commercial and
retail banking and mortgage lending products and services. The Company provides
commercial loans, lease financing, cash management, lockbox, customized draft
processing, and other special financial services for business and other
commercial banking customers. The Company provides a wide range of personal
banking services to individuals, including bankcard, student and other


installment loans and home equity lines of
credit, checking accounts, savings accounts, time certificates of various types
and maturities, trust services, safe deposit facilities, direct deposit, and
24-hour ATM access. Zions First National Bank also provides services to key
segments through its Women’s Financial, Private Client Services, and Executive
Banking Groups. National Bank of Arizona also provides services through an
Executive Banking Group.

In addition to these core businesses, the
Company has built specialized lines of business in capital markets and public
finance. The Company provides online trading through Zions Direct Online
Brokerage (www.zionsdirect.com), the online brokerage arm of Zions Investment
Securities, Inc., a member of the National Association of Security Dealers
(“NASD”) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”).  Zions Direct offers free real-time quotes,
free news, free access for reviewing personal portfolios, and inexpensive
online trading of stocks, options, and more than 6,000 mutual funds. Other
services include estate planning, investment management, financial planning,
registered investment advisor services, and retirement planning.

Electronic trading of U.S. Treasury and
Agency issues is available through the Company on four electronic delivery
platforms. Institutional investors with the Bloomberg system can access Zions
at “BBT (GO)” and “Zions (GO)”, or via the Internet at GovRate.com

TM

or OddLot.com. The Company’s proprietary site, GovRate.com, also provides a
search engine for municipal, corporate and agency securities. On average, the
Company clears approximately $2 billion of securities each day.

Zions Bank Capital Markets makes markets in
U.S. Treasuries, Agencies, Municipals, Small Business Administration (“SBA”)
Pools, Mortgage-Backed/Asset-Backed Securities, and Repurchase Agreements.  Its customer base is comprised of global
institutions such as major corporations, banks, insurance companies, and
municipalities.  Zions Investment
Securities, Inc. makes markets in over 200 investment grade corporate bonds.

Zions also offers Liquid Asset Management, an
investment service that enhances earnings on cash while maintaining liquidity.
The Company’s combined public finance operations constitute one of the largest
municipal advisory firms in the country. For five consecutive years, the
combined financial advisory business of the Company has ranked among the
nation’s top ten municipal financial advisors.

The Company is also a leader in U.S. Small
Business Administration lending. Through its six bank subsidiaries, the Company
provides SBA 7(a) loans to small businesses throughout the United States.
According to published reports by the SBA, the Company ranked as the eighth
largest provider of SBA-backed 7(a) loans in terms of number of loans approved
for the SBA fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.  The Company is also the largest provider of SBA 504 financing in
the nation. The Company also owns an equity interest in the Federal
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and is the nation’s top originator
of secondary market agricultural real estate mortgage loans through Farmer Mac.

The Company continues to be recognized as a
leader in providing a variety of innovative e-commerce products and solutions.
The Company’s Digital Signature Trust Co. (“DST”) established its TrustID

(R)

certificate, sponsored by the American Bankers Association, as the credential
of choice for online authentication of financial transactions. The Mortgage
Bankers Association of America endorsed TrustID certificates as the exclusive
standard for online lending initiatives among its nearly 1,500 members. DST has
also been a leader in enabling federal


government agencies to prepare for compliance
with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (“GPEA”). Under the GPEA, all
government agencies must have all of their high-use forms available in
electronic format, and must be able to accept transmission of those forms
electronically by 2003. Among the products DST introduced during 2001 are
FedSign and ACES eKit, which are designed to enable government agencies to meet
the GPEA requirements.

The Company also launched Lexign

TM

in 2001. Lexign provides software and end-to-end, trusted electronic
transaction management. Lexign software enables an organization to easily
translate any paper form into an XML-based electronic form, to manage the
workflow of the form throughout the organization, and to digitally and
irrevocably attach signatures to the form. In addition to Lexign, the Company launched
EnterVault, which provides secure storage of documents over the Internet in the
Company’s own data processing facilities. This enables the Company to not only
offer electronic document and transaction management solutions, but also highly
reliable and secure long-term storage of electronic documents generated by
customers.

Other
Nonbanking Subsidiaries

The Company conducts various other
banking-related business activities through subsidiaries of Zions First
National Bank (“ZFNB”) and the Parent.  Zions Credit Corporation, a subsidiary of ZFNB, engages in lease
origination and servicing operations. Zions Investment Securities, Inc., also a
subsidiary of ZFNB, provides discount investment brokerage services on a
nonadvisory basis to both commercial and consumer customers.  Personal investment officers employed by
this discount brokerage subsidiary provide customers with a wide range of
investment products, including stocks, municipal bonds, mutual funds and tax-deferred
annuities.  Four venture capital
companies owned by the Company provide early-stage capital, primarily for
start-up companies located in the Western United States.  Zions Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary
of the Company, underwrites, as reinsurer, credit-related life and disability insurance.  Zions Insurance Agency, Inc., a subsidiary
of the Company, operates an insurance brokerage business, which administers
various credit-related insurance programs in the Company’s subsidiaries and
sells general lines of insurance.  Zions
Management Services Company, also a subsidiary of the Company, provides
administrative, data processing, and other services to other subsidiaries of
the Company.

Competition

Zions Bancorporation and its subsidiaries
operate in a highly competitive environment due to the diverse financial
services and products they offer. 
Competitors include not only other banks, thrift institutions, credit
unions, and mutual funds, but also, insurance companies, finance companies,
brokerage firms, securities dealers, investment banking companies, and a
variety of other financial services and advisory companies.  Many of these competitors are not subject to
the same regulatory restrictions as the Company.  Most of these competitors compete across geographic boundaries
and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking
services in many significant products. 
These competitive trends are likely to continue.

Supervision
and Regulation

Zions Bancorporation is a financial holding
company and, as such, is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (“the BHC Act”). 
The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board
(“FRB”) for a financial holding company to


acquire or hold more than 5% voting interest
in any bank, and restricts interstate banking activities.  The BHC Act allows interstate bank
acquisitions and interstate branching by acquisition anywhere in the country.

The BHC Act restricts the Company’s nonbanking
activities to those which are permitted for bank holding companies or
determined by the FRB to be financial in nature, incidental to financial
activities, or complementary to financial activities.  The BHC Act does not place territorial restrictions on the
activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.  The Company’s banking subsidiaries are
subject to limitations with respect to transactions with affiliates.

The Company’s banking subsidiaries are also
subject to various requirements and restrictions in the laws of the United
States and in the states in which the banks operate.  These include restrictions on the amount of loans to a borrower
and its affiliates, the nature and amount of their investments, their ability
to act as an underwriter of securities, the opening of branches and the
acquisition of other financial entities. 
The Company’s subsidiary banks are subject to the provisions of the
National Bank Act or the banking laws of their respective states, are under the
supervision of, and are subject to periodic examination by, the Comptroller of
the Currency (“OCC”) or their respective state banking departments, and are
subject to the rules and regulations of the OCC, the FRB, and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).

The FRB has established capital guidelines
for financial holding companies.  The
OCC, the FDIC, and the FRB have also issued regulations establishing capital
requirements for banks under federal law. 
Failure to meet capital requirements could subject the Company and its
subsidiary banks to a variety of restrictions and enforcement remedies.  See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding capital requirements.

The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’
risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (“the BIS”). 
The BIS is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators
from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines
that each country’s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies
they apply.  In January 2001, the BIS
released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new capital
accord that would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the
existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures.  Operational risk is defined to mean the risk
of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people and systems or from external events. 
The 1988 capital accord does not include separate capital requirements
for operational risk.  The events of
September 11, 2001 demonstrate the importance for financial institutions of
managing operational risks. The BIS has stated that its objective is to
finalize a new capital accord in 2002 and for member countries to implement the
new accord in 2005.  The ultimate timing
for the new accord and the specifics of capital assessments for addressing
operational risk are uncertain. 
However, the Company expects that a new capital accord addressing
operational risk will eventually be adopted by the BIS and implemented by the
U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.

In January 2002, the federal bank regulators
adopted rules, effective April 1, 2002, governing the regulatory capital
treatment of equity investments in nonfinancial companies.  The federal rules require a series of
marginal capital charges on covered equity investments that increase with the
level of those investments as a percentage of Tier 1 capital.  With certain exceptions, the rules


require that the Company and its bank
subsidiaries deduct from Tier 1 capital the appropriate percentage set out in
the following table:

The effect that the newly adopted rules may
have on the Company’s subsidiary banks is not expected to be significant.

Dividends payable by the subsidiary banks to
Zions Bancorporation are subject to various legal and regulatory
restrictions.  These restrictions and
the amount available for the payment of dividends at year-end are summarized in
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989 provides that the Company’s bank subsidiaries are
liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the failure of an
affiliated insured bank.

Because of favorable loss experience and a
healthy reserve ratio in the Bank Insurance Fund (“BIF”) of the FDIC, well
capitalized and well managed banks, including the Company’s bank subsidiaries,
have in recent years paid relatively small premiums for FDIC insurance.  A number of factors suggest that as early as
the second half of 2002, even well capitalized and well managed banks will be
required to pay premiums on deposit insurance. 
The amount of any such premiums will depend on the outcome of
legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as the BIF loss experience and
other factors, none of which the Company is in a position to predict at this
time.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 prescribes standards for the safety and soundness of
insured banks.  These standards relate
to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan
documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, and
compensation, as well as other operational and management standards deemed
appropriate by the federal banking regulatory agencies.

The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)
requires banks to help serve the credit needs in their communities, including
credit to low and moderate income individuals. 
Should the Company or its subsidiaries fail to adequately serve their
communities, penalties may be imposed including denials of applications to add
branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, and merge with or purchase
other financial institutions.

The enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
of 1999 (“the GLB Act”) represented a pivotal point in the history of the
financial services industry.  The GLB Act
swept away large parts of a regulatory framework that had its origins in the
Depression Era of the 1930s.  Effective
March 11, 2000, new opportunities became available for banks, other depository
institutions, insurance companies and securities firms to enter into
combinations that permit a single financial services organization to offer
customers a more complete array of financial products and services.  The


GLB Act provides a new regulatory framework
through a financial holding company, which has as its umbrella regulator the
FRB.  Functional regulation of the
financial holding company’s separately regulated subsidiaries is conducted by
their primary functional regulator. 
Among other things, the GLB Act requires “satisfactory” or higher CRA
compliance for insured depository institutions and their financial holding
companies in order for them to engage in new financial activities.  The GLB Act provides a federal right to
privacy of non-public personal information of individual customers.  The Company, including its subsidiaries, is
also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of
nonpublic personal information.

On October 26, 2001, the President signed
into law comprehensive antiterrorism legislation known as the USA Patriot
Act.  Title III of the USA Patriot Act
requires financial institutions, including the Company’s bank and broker-dealer
subsidiaries, to help prevent, detect, and prosecute international money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. 
The Company’s bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries have augmented their
systems and procedures to accomplish this objective.  The Secretary of the Treasury has proposed additional regulations
to further implement Title III.  Although the Company cannot predict when and in what form these
regulations will be adopted, the Company believes that the cost of compliance
with Title III of the USA Patriot Act is not likely to be material to the
Company.

Regulators and Congress continue to enact
rules, laws, and policies to regulate the financial services industry and to
protect consumers.  The nature of these
laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on future business and
earnings of the Company cannot be predicted.

Government
Monetary Policies

The earnings and business of the Company are
affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by fiscal and other
policies adopted by various governmental authorities.  The Company is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB
which affects the national supply of bank credit.  The instruments and methods of monetary policy available to the
FRB include open-market operations in U.S. government securities; adjustment of
the discount rates or cost of bank borrowings; imposing or changing reserve
requirements against member bank deposits; and imposing or changing reserve
requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying combinations
to influence the overall growth or contraction of bank loans, investments and
deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.

In view of the changing conditions in the
economy and the effect of the FRB’s monetary policies, it is difficult to
predict future changes in loan demand, deposit levels and interest rates, or
their effect on the business and earnings of the Company.  FRB monetary policies have had a significant
effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are
expected to continue to do so in the future.

Employees

At December 31, 2001, the Company employed
approximately 8,124 full-time equivalent personnel with approximately 6,665
employed by the banking subsidiaries. 
The Company had 6,915 full-time equivalent employees at December 31,
2000, compared to 6,833 at December 31, 1999. 
The Company believes that it enjoys good employee relations.  In addition to competitive


salaries and wages, the Company contributes
to group medical plans, group insurance plans, stock ownership plans, and a
pension plan.

ITEM 2. 
PROPERTIES

The Company operates 413 branches, of which
182 are owned and 231 are on leased premises. 
The annual rentals under long-term leases for such banking premises are
determined under various formulas and factors, including operating costs,
maintenance, and taxes. For information regarding rental payments, see Note 14
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
