PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Business Overview

The company is a Delaware corporation formed in 1952 as successor to the
Electric Boat Company. The company’s businesses include information and
communications technology, land and amphibious combat systems, naval and
commercial shipbuilding, and business aviation. These are high technology
businesses that use design, manufacturing and program management expertise
together with advanced technology and the integration of complex systems as
part of their everyday operations.

In the mid 1990’s, the company began a series of acquisitions that
expanded its core businesses in the defense industry, broadened its expertise
in systems integration and C4ISR (command and control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) systems, and added
business aviation products and services to the company’s offerings. Since
January 1, 1997, the company has acquired 21 businesses, including five
acquisitions during 2001. In late January, the company acquired Primex
Technologies, Inc., renamed Ordnance and Tactical Systems, expanding the
company’s market position in ordnance manufacturing to include medium- and
large- caliber ammunition. This acquisition also expanded the company’s
portfolio in what it believes to be the high growth areas of missile and
precision-guided munitions through existing subcontract relationships. In
mid-February, the company acquired four aircraft service and maintenance
facilities from BBA North America. These operations now conduct business as
General Dynamics Aviation Services, and are located in Dallas, Las Vegas,
Minneapolis and West Palm Beach. In early June, the company acquired
substantially all of the assets of Galaxy Aerospace Company LP. This
acquisition broadened the Gulfstream product line with the mid-size Gulfstream
100 and the super mid-size Gulfstream 200 – creating market-entry, add-on and
move-up opportunities for a wider range of customers. In late July, the
company acquired Spain’s leading defense manufacturer, Empresa Nacional Santa
Bárbara de Industrias Militares, S.A., of Madrid, Spain, and Santa Bárbara
Blindados, S.A., of Seville. The new combined entity, renamed Santa Bárbara
Sistemas, S.A., produces combat vehicles and munitions and is expected to
enhance the company’s export abilities into Europe, North Africa and South
America. Also, at the end of September, the company acquired Integrated
Information Systems Group from Motorola, Inc. Renamed Decision Systems, this
business provides technologies, products and systems that strengthen the
company’s position in what management believes to be rapidly growing
information assurance, communications and situational awareness markets here
and abroad.


The company operates in four primary business groups: Information Systems
and Technology, Combat Systems, Marine Systems, and Aerospace. The company
also owns certain commercial operations, which are identified for reporting
purposes as Other. Information on revenues, operating profit and identifiable
assets attributable to each of the company’s reportable business groups is
included in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 46 of the
2001 Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference. A
description of the company’s products and services by business group,
competition and other related information is provided below.

Industry Overview

The company’s primary customers are the U.S. military, other government
organizations, the armed forces of allied nations, and a diverse base of
corporate and industrial buyers. Historically, a significant portion of the
company’s sales has been to the U.S. government and its agencies. As a result,
funding for the company’s products and services is generally linked to trends
in U.S. and international defense spending.

Following a period of budget decreases in the post-Cold War era, the U.S.
defense budget, as appropriated by Congress, has increased in recent years. The
Bush Administration submitted to Congress a $328 billion fiscal 2002 defense
budget that reflected an 11 percent increase over the fiscal 2001 defense
budget submitted by the Clinton Administration, representing the first
double-digit increase since Operation Desert Storm. The 2003 U.S. defense
budget proposal President Bush sent to Congress calls for increased procurement
spending of $68.7 billion in 2003, reaching $98.9 billion by 2007. The company
expects that the U.S. defense budgets for research, development, test and
evaluation, and procurement, both of which fund the company’s programs, will
grow proportionately with the overall level of defense spending. While the
ultimate distribution of the defense budget remains uncertain, the company
believes it is well positioned to benefit from the increase in defense
spending.

The company expects to see long-term growth in the business aviation
sector as well. The addition of the mid- and super mid-size aircraft should
allow the company to increase its sales in the business aviation market. The
company also expects to increase its penetration of the special mission
aircraft markets for U.S. and international defense forces. The future success
of the company’s commercial aircraft business is dependent on a number of
factors, some of which are beyond the company’s control. These factors include
general economic conditions, price and demand pressures in the market, the
company’s ability to continue to achieve efficiencies necessary to realize
expected margins, and the company’s ability to meet planned timetables for the
development, certification and delivery of new product offerings.

The company designs and manufactures the M1 Series Abrams Main Battle Tank
for the U.S. Army and various foreign governments. The company also performs
engineering and upgrade work, and provides support for existing armored
vehicles. The company recently completed a five-year multiyear contract with
the Army under which 580 tanks were upgraded from the M1 to the M1A2 and M1A2
System Enhancement Package (SEP) configurations. The company is currently in
production on a follow-on contract to upgrade an additional 307 tanks to the
M1A2 SEP configuration. As of December 31, 2001, 265 tanks remain to be
upgraded, with deliveries scheduled through 2004.

The company is under contract with the Marine Corps for the systems
development and demonstration phase of the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle
(AAAV). Under this phase, the company expects to complete the design and
development of the AAAV, manufacture 10 new prototypes, refurbish three early
development prototypes and prepare for the production phase of the program.

The company and General Motors Canada Ltd. have entered into a joint
venture to equip the U.S. Army’s Brigade Combat Teams with an eight-wheeled
armored vehicle called the Stryker. Pursuant to the joint venture, the company
will share in the development, testing, evaluation and production of 2,131
vehicles.

In Spain, the company is under contracts to provide to the Spanish army
235 Leopard main battle tanks, built under license from a German company, and
48 Pizarro tracked infantry fighting vehicles.

The company provides a total range of armament system capabilities
including design, development, production and lifecycle management. Products
include medium- and large-caliber ammunition, propellants, armament and
satellite propulsion products. The company provides systems management and has
produced over 300,000 rockets, warheads and motors for the Army’s 2.75-inch
Hydra 70 rocket system. Also, the company manufactures single- and
multi-barrel medium-caliber gun systems, individual- and crew-served weapons,
and reactive armor tiles for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.


MARINE SYSTEMS

The Marine Systems group provides the U.S. Navy with combat vessels,
including nuclear submarines, surface combatants and auxiliary ships. The
group also provides ship management services for the U.S. government and builds
commercial ships.

Net sales for the Marine Systems group were 30 percent, 33 percent and 34
percent of the company’s consolidated net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Net sales (in millions) by major products and services were as
follows:

Nuclear submarines and related services

The company designs, builds and supports nuclear submarines for the Navy.
The company has construction contracts for the first four ships of the

Virginia

-class submarine and the third of three

Seawolf

-class attack
submarines. Construction work on the

Virginia

-class submarine is shared equally
with Newport News Shipbuilding Inc.

In addition to nuclear submarine design and construction, the company
performs a broad range of engineering work, including advanced research and
technology development, systems and component design evaluation, prototype
development and logistics support for the operating fleet. The company also
serves as ship integrator for certain components and subassemblies of the
submarines, such as electronic equipment.

The company will also have design, engineering and construction management
responsibilities for the conversion of four

Trident-

class SSBN submarines to cruise
missile SSGNs. As SSGNs, these submarines will be delivery platforms for
cruise missiles, special operations forces and advanced payloads and sensors.

Surface combatants

The company has been awarded contracts to date for the construction of 27

Arleigh Burke

-class destroyers (DDG-51) and plays a lead role in providing
design, engineering and ongoing lifecycle support services for these ships.
The company is also a member of a three-contractor team that was awarded a
contract to design and build the Navy’s new

San Antonio

-class of amphibious
assault ships. The company has a contract for the construction of the third
ship of the class, the LPD-19.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Navy canceled its DD-21 program and
transferred its investment in technology development to DD(X), the next
generation family of combatants. In February 2002, a team led by the company,
formerly the prime contractor for the design phase of the previous DD-21
program, submitted a proposal for the DD(X). It is anticipated that a design
will be selected and an award made for the research and design work on the
DD(X) in the spring of 2002.

Auxiliary and commercial ships

The company designs, builds and repairs ships for the Navy and commercial
customers. The company has been awarded contracts to date for the design and
construction of eight strategic sealift ships and two dry-cargo combat
logistics ships for the Navy. Contracts with commercial customers include the
construction of two cargo ships and four double-hull crude oil tankers. The
company also manages 23 ready-reserve, fast sealift and prepositioning ships
for the U.S. government.


AEROSPACE

The Aerospace group designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and provides
maintenance and support services for technologically advanced business jet
aircraft. The group also supplies special mission aircraft to governments.
Gulfstream has delivered more than 1,300 aircraft for customers
around the world and offers a range of aircraft products and services,
including the Gulfstream IV-SP, the Gulfstream V and the Gulfstream V-SP.
Certification and initial customer deliveries of the Gulfstream V-SP are
expected in the fourth quarter of 2002. The mid-size Gulfstream 100 and super
mid-size Gulfstream 200 were added to the group’s offering with its
acquisition of the assets of Galaxy Aerospace Company LP in June 2001.

Net sales for the Aerospace group were 27 percent, 29 percent and 32 percent of the
company’s consolidated net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net
sales (in millions) by major products and services were as follows:

New aircraft

Aerospace’s products include the Gulfstream IV-SP, which serves the
large-cabin business jet aircraft market and the Gulfstream V, which serves the
ultra-long range market. The company believes the Gulfstream IV-SP and
Gulfstream V offer the best combination of large cabin size, fast cruising
speed and technologically advanced avionics of any large business jet aircraft
in both the long and ultra-long range market segments. The Gulfstream V-SP,
which will also serve the ultra-long range market, will offer increased range,
increased mission flexibility for both ultra-long range and high-speed
long-range flights, reduced takeoff field length, and increased cabin and
baggage space.

In 2001, the Aerospace group introduced the mid-size Gulfstream 100 and
the super mid-size Gulfstream 200. These two aircraft models have expanded the
company’s product offering so that it now includes a broad range of aircraft
priced from $12 million to $46 million.

Aircraft services and pre-owned aircraft

The Aerospace group also provides worldwide aircraft maintenance services
and technical support for both Gulfstream and other business aircraft. The
company provides an integrated network of company-owned service centers,
authorized third-party service providers, worldwide parts depots, worldwide
service representatives and 24 hour-a-day technical/aircraft on-the-ground
support.

The Aerospace group routinely accepts pre-owned aircraft in trade to
facilitate the sale of new Gulfstream aircraft. These aircraft are then resold
by the company in the pre-owned market.

OTHER

The company’s Other businesses consist of a coal mining operation, an
aggregates operation and a leasing operation for liquefied natural gas tankers.
Net sales for these businesses represented approximately two percent of the
company’s consolidated net sales in each of the last three years. Net sales
(in millions) were $276, $253 and $250, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.


Competition

Virtually all of the products produced and sold by the company are highly
engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration
techniques and capabilities. Additionally, the product and program needs of
the company’s government and commercial customers regularly change and evolve.
The company’s ability to successfully compete is highly dependent on the
technical excellence and reliability of the company’s products and services,
its reputation for integrating complex systems, the ability of the company’s
leadership team to successfully manage the company’s businesses and respond to
the changing needs of the company’s customers, and the cost competitiveness of
the company’s products and services.

DEFENSE CONTRACTS

U.S. and global defense industry consolidation continues to intensify
competition as the number of defense contractors decreases. As a result of
this consolidation, the company frequently is a partner with, or subcontractor
to, a defense supplier on one project, while simultaneously competing against
that contractor for another award. These strategic partnerships and
relationships improve the company’s ability to obtain new business, but also
make it crucial for the company to differentiate itself from its competitors.

BUSINESS AIRCRAFT

The business aircraft market is generally divided into segments based on
the cabin size and range of the aircraft. Aerospace offers its aircraft
products in the mid-size, the super mid-size and the long and ultra-long range
large-cabin segments. The Gulfstream IV-SP competes in the large-cabin
business aircraft market segment with the Dassault Falcon 900C and 900EX. The
Gulfstream V and Gulfstream V-SP compete in the ultra-long range business
aircraft market segment against the Bombardier Global Express. Two competitors
announced new products during 2001 that will compete with the Gulfstream IV-SP
and Gulfstream V. The Bombardier Global 5000 has an expected market
introduction in 2004, and the Dassault Falcon 7X is expected to be introduced in
2006.

One of the company’s newest aircraft products, the Gulfstream 100,
competes in the mid-cabin market segment against the Raytheon Hawker 800XP
aircraft and the Bombardier LearJet 60 aircraft. The Gulfstream 100 has the
fastest speed and longest range as compared to these two competitive aircraft.
The Gulfstream 200 competes in a new market segment — the super mid-cabin
market. The Gulfstream 200 was introduced in the market in late 1999, two
years ahead of two new competitive products – Bombardier’s Continental due for
customer delivery in 2002 and Raytheon’s Hawker Horizon due for customer
delivery in 2003.

The company believes that it competes favorably in its markets on the
basis of the performance characteristics of its aircraft, the quality and
timeliness of the service it provides, as well as its innovative marketing
programs. In addition, the company was able to certify the Gulfstream V
significantly in advance of its competition and has maintained a substantial
market lead. The company believes that the introduction of the second
generation of the ultra-long range business jet, the Gulfstream V-SP, will
enable the company to maintain or increase its position in this important
market segment. Further, the company believes its aircrafts’ operating costs
are comparable to or lower than those of its competitors and that its products
are competitively priced.

Customers

Historically, the majority of the company’s sales were to the U.S.
government and its agencies. In 2001, 60 percent of the company’s net sales
were to the U.S. government, either as a prime contractor or as a
subcontractor; 30 percent of the company’s net sales were to U.S. commercial
customers and six percent to international commercial customers; and the
remaining four percent were directly to international defense customers.


U.S. GOVERNMENT

Net sales to the U.S. government include Foreign Military Sales (FMS),
which are sales to foreign governments through the U.S. government, whereby the
company contracts with and receives payment from the U.S. government and the
U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the customer. U.S.
government sales (in millions) were as follows:

The company’s U.S. government products and programs must compete with the
products and programs of other defense contractors. The funding of government
programs is dependent on congressional appropriations and administrative
allotment of funds, and may be affected by changes in government policies
resulting from various military and political developments. In addition,
funding for defense programs competes with nondefense spending of the U.S.
government. A shift in government defense spending to other programs in which
the company is not involved or a reduction in defense spending generally could
negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings.

The company acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor for many different
government programs. U.S. government defense contracts typically involve long
lead times for design and development, and are subject to significant changes
in contract scheduling. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year
basis even though a program may continue for several years. Consequently,
programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are
committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. The termination or
reduction of funding for a government program would result in a loss of
anticipated future revenues attributable to that program.

The company’s U.S. government business is performed under both
cost-reimbursement (sometimes referred to as “cost-type”) and fixed-price
contracts. Contracts for research, engineering, prototypes, repair and
maintenance are often cost-reimbursement arrangements, under which the customer
reimburses the company for allowable costs and pays a predetermined fee. A
large percentage of the company’s production contracts are fixed-price
arrangements, pursuant to which the company agrees to perform a specific scope
of work for a fixed amount. For the year ended December 31, 2001, cost-type
and fixed-price contracts accounted for approximately 42 percent and 58
percent, respectively, of the company’s defense business.

Cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts present their own advantages
and disadvantages for the company. Cost-type arrangements generally involve
lower risk for the company, and sometimes involve fee schedules that allow the
company to obtain increased payments for satisfying certain performance
criteria. However, not all of the company’s costs are recoverable under these
types of contracts, and the government typically has the right to object to the
company’s costs as not allowable or unreasonable, which can increase the
company’s risk. Fixed-price arrangements generally provide the company with
greater profit potential if it can complete the work for less than the contract
amount. However, fixed-price contracts also expose the company to increased
risk of potential cost overruns.

U.S. COMMERCIAL

Commercial sales (in millions) to domestic customers were $3,664, $3,209
and $2,790 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The majority of the company’s
commercial sales were for Gulfstream aircraft to national and multinational
corporations. The aircraft are operated by customers in a wide spectrum of
industries and customer groups including: pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, high
technology, energy, industrial manufacturing, finance, insurance, real estate,
mining, transportation, communications, public utilities and the retail trade,
as well as individuals.


The company has an agreement with an unaffiliated customer who purchases
aircraft from the company for use in its fractional ownership program,
Executive Jet International (Executive Jet), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway and
the leader in the fractional market. Sales to Executive Jet were approximately
nine percent of Aerospace sales in both 2001 and 2000 and approximately eight
percent of Aerospace sales in 1999.

INTERNATIONAL

Direct international sales (in millions) to both defense and commercial
customers were $1,180, $967 and $966 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
These sales represented approximately ten percent of the company’s consolidated
net sales in each of the past three years. International defense sales were
derived primarily from the company’s international operations; international
commercial sales were related primarily to the export of business aircraft.
The company owns operations located in Canada, the U.K. and Spain. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, sales and operating earnings from international
operations were three percent and one percent of consolidated sales and
operating earnings, respectively. Identifiable assets of operations domiciled
outside the U.S. were seven percent, four percent and six percent of total
identifiable assets at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. At
December 31, 2001, these assets consisted primarily of cash and intangible
assets, including goodwill.

For information regarding sales by geographic region, see Note S to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 46 of the 2001 Annual Report, filed
as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference.

Supplies

The company is dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for raw
materials and a large number of components used in the production of its
products. Fuel or material shortages could adversely impact the company’s
suppliers, thus impairing their ability to honor their contractual commitments
with the company. Although, in some cases, the company is dependent on one or
a few sources, the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining the
resources necessary for its business operations.

Research and Development

The company’s defense and business aviation operations conduct independent
research and development activities, which include bid and proposal work. The
company’s defense businesses conduct research and development activities under
U.S. government contracts. These research efforts have been and continue to be
concerned with developing products for large systems development programs and
performing work under research and development technology contracts.

Research and development activities of the company’s defense businesses
represented the majority of company-sponsored expenditures in each of the past
three years. A significant portion of these expenditures is recovered through
overhead charges pursuant to U.S. government contracts. Research and
development activities of the Aerospace group are internally funded product
enhancement and product development programs for Gulfstream aircraft.

Research and development expenditures (in millions) were as follows:

For further discussion of backlog, see Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of the Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 15

on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, and incorporated herein by
reference.

DEFENSE BUSINESSES

Total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be
performed under firm contracts. Funded backlog for government programs
represents the portion of total backlog that has been appropriated by Congress
and funded by the procuring agency. To the extent backlog has not been funded,
there is no assurance that congressional appropriations or agency allotments
will be forthcoming.

AEROSPACE

Aerospace funded backlog represents orders for which the company has
entered into definitive purchase contracts and has received non-refundable
deposits from the customers. Unfunded aircraft backlog includes options to
purchase new aircraft and agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and
support services.

Forty-eight percent of Aerospace funded backlog is with commercial
customers other than Executive Jet. Backlog with Executive Jet represents 43
percent of Aerospace funded backlog. The remaining nine percent of Aerospace
funded backlog is with government customers. Executive Jet represents the
majority of Aerospace unfunded backlog. Following UAL Corporation’s
announcement on March 22, 2002 that it was closing its Avolar subsidiary,
which was to engage in a fractional ownership program, the company terminated
its agreements with Avolar, which previously represented $2.5 billion of total
backlog. Prior to the termination of the Avolar agreements, contracts with
Avolar represented approximately $800 million of firm contracts backlog for 36
aircraft. The company believes that it will be able to re-market the aircraft
previously under contract to Avolar.

Regulatory Matters

U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE CONTRACTS

In 2001, 60 percent of the company’s net sales were to the U.S.
government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor. Generally,
government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government
representatives and contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in
part, at the government’s convenience or for default. If a contract is
terminated at the convenience of the U.S. government, a contractor is entitled
to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate
share of fees or earnings for the work done. Contracts which are terminated for
default generally provide that the government only pays for the work it has
accepted and may require the contractor to pay for the incremental cost of
reprocurement and may hold the contractor liable for damages. Since the
majority of the company’s revenues are dependent on the procurement,
performance and payment under the company’s U.S. government contracts, the
termination of one or more critical government contracts could have a negative
impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition.


The company’s government businesses are also subject to specific
procurement regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations and
requirements could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government
contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.

BUSINESS AIRCRAFT

The Aerospace group is subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation
Administration in the U.S. and other similar aviation regulatory authorities
throughout the world. For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model
must have received a Type Certificate from the appropriate aviation authority,
and each individual aircraft must have also received a Certificate of
Airworthiness. Maintenance facilities are also required to be licensed by
aviation authorities. Aviation authorities have the power to require changes
to aircraft if deemed necessary for safety purposes.

ENVIRONMENTAL

The company’s operations are subject to and affected by a variety of
federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating
to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation
of certain materials, substances and wastes. The company continually assesses
its compliance status and management of other environmental matters. The
company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance
and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of the
company’s operations. These costs are not significant relative to total
operating costs or cash flows and often are allowable costs under the company’s
contracts with the U.S. government. These costs have not been material in the
past and, based on information presently available to the company and on U.S.
government policies relating to allowable costs in effect at this time, all of
which are subject to change, the company does not expect continued compliance
to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations or financial
condition.

Under existing U.S. environmental laws, “Potentially Responsible Parties”
(PRP) are jointly and severally liable, and therefore the company is
potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of
remediating contamination at the company’s facilities or former facilities or
at third-party sites where the company has been designated a PRP by the EPA or
a state environmental agency. In the unlikely event that the company is
required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the statutory framework would
allow the company to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs. Additional
information relating to the impact of environmental controls is included in
Item 3, “Legal Proceedings — Environmental” on page 17 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Intellectual Property

The company is an established leader in the development of innovative
products, manufacturing technologies and systems integration practices. In
addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, the
company also licenses certain intellectual property rights of third parties,
including the U.S. government. Additionally, in many cases, the U.S.
government licenses the company’s patents, pursuant to which the government may
use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by the patents. Although
these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of the
company’s business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property
right is of such importance that its loss or termination would, in the opinion
of management, have a material impact on the company’s business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, the company had approximately 51,700 employees,
of whom 32 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements with
various unions, the most significant of which are the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Marine Draftsmen’s Association, the
Metal Trades Council of New London, Connecticut, and the United Auto Workers
Union. Agreements covering approximately three percent of total employees are
due to expire during 2002.

In February 2002, the company announced that it expects to close its
Oklahoma City, OK facility before year-end 2002.


Other Properties.

Freeman Energy operates two underground coal mines and one
surface coal mine in Illinois. Coal preparation facilities and rail loading
facilities are located at each mine sufficient for its output. Material
Service operates several stone quarries, as well as sand and gravel pits and
yards in the Chicago, Illinois and Indiana areas for its aggregates business.

The company owns approximately 260 acres of property in Rancho Cucamonga,
California, of which approximately 93 acres is undeveloped.

General.

The company believes that its main facilities are adequate for
the present needs of the company and its subsidiaries and, as supplemented by
planned improvements and construction, are expected to remain adequate for the
foreseeable future.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The company is subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising
out of the ordinary course of its business or arising under provisions relating
to the protection of the environment.

The company is primarily engaged in providing products and services under
contracts with the U.S. government and, to a lesser degree, under direct
foreign sales contracts, some of which are funded by the U.S. government.
These contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and,
from time to time, agencies of the U.S. government investigate whether the
company’s operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements.
The company does not believe that the outcome of any such government
investigations will have a material impact on the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

Termination of A-12 Program

In January 1991, the Navy terminated the company’s A-12 aircraft contract
for default. The A-12 contract was a fixed-price incentive contract for the
full-scale development and initial production of the Navy’s new carrier-based
Advanced Tactical Aircraft. Both the company and McDonnell Douglas, now owned
by the Boeing Company, (the contractors) were parties to the contract with the
Navy, each had full responsibility to the Navy for performance under the
contract, and both are jointly and severally liable for potential liabilities
arising from the termination. As a consequence of the termination for default,
the Navy demanded that the contractors repay $1,352 million in unliquidated
progress payments, but agreed to defer collection of the amount pending a
decision by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims on the contractors’ challenge to
the termination for default, or a negotiated settlement.

The contractors filed a complaint on June 7, 1991, in the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims contesting the default termination. In December 1994, the court
issued an order vacating the termination for default. On December 19, 1995,
following further proceedings, the court issued an order converting the
termination for default to a termination for convenience. On March 31, 1998, a
final judgment was entered in favor of the contractors for $1.2 billion plus
interest.

On July 1, 1999, the Court of Appeals found that the Trial Court erred in
converting the termination for default to a termination for convenience without
first determining whether a default existed. The Court of Appeals remanded the
case for determination of whether the government’s default termination was
justified. On August 31, 2001, following the trial on remand, the Trial Court
issued an opinion upholding the default termination of the A-12 contract. In
its opinion, the Trial Court rejected all of the government’s arguments to
sustain the default termination except for one, schedule. With respect to the
government’s schedule arguments, the Trial Court held that the schedule the
government unilaterally imposed was reasonable and enforceable, and that the
government had not waived that schedule. On the sole ground that the
contractors were not going to deliver the first aircraft on the date provided
in the unilateral schedule, the Trial Court upheld the default termination and
entered judgment for the government.

The contractors filed post-trial motions seeking reconsideration by the
Trial Court of its opinion and judgment. On October 4, 2001, the Trial Court
denied the contractors’ post-trial motions. On November 30, 2001, the company
filed its notice of appeal.


The company continues to believe strongly in the merits of its case. The
company believes that in concluding to the contrary on remand, the Trial Court
applied incorrect legal standards and otherwise erred as a matter of law. The
company believes that it has substantial arguments on appeal to persuade the
Court of Appeals to reverse the Trial Court’s judgment. The contractors have
asked the Navy to confirm the deferral of payment through the pendency of the
appeal. The contractors and the Navy have not yet reached an agreement with
respect to this request.

If, contrary to the company’s expectations, the default termination is
sustained on appeal, the contractors could be required to repay the government
as much as $1,352 million for progress payments received for the A-12 contract
plus interest (approximately $970 million at December 31, 2001). In this
outcome, the government contends the company’s liability would be approximately
$1.2 billion pretax, $625 million after-tax to be taken as a charge against
discontinued operations. The company has sufficient resources to pay such an
obligation if required.

False Claims Act

On May 7, 1999, a whistleblower suit was filed under seal against the
company in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of South
Carolina. The plaintiff alleges that the company violated the False Claims Act
by omitting certain facts when it testified before Congress in 1995 concerning
funding for the third

Seawolf-

attack submarine. The plaintiff seeks damages in
the amount of the contract award for the third

Seawolf

, subject to trebling
under the False Claims Act. The Department of Justice declined to intervene in
the case on the plaintiff’s behalf and the suit was unsealed in December 2000.
The complaint has been removed to the United States District Court for the
District of South Carolina.

The Court has directed discovery on the issue of whether the alleged
omissions by the company were material to the government’s decision to award
the third

Seawolf

to the company. The parties filed motions on this issue on
March 15, 2002. The company believes that it has substantial legal and factual
arguments that will result in either the dismissal of the case or a judgment in
the company’s favor.

Environmental

The company’s operations are subject to and affected by a variety of
federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. The
company is directly or indirectly involved in environmental responses at some
of the company’s facilities and former facilities, and at third-party sites not
owned by the company but where the company has been designated a PRP by the EPA
or a state environmental agency. The company is also involved in the
investigation, cleanup and remediation of various conditions at sites it
currently owns and operates or formerly owned or operated where the release of
hazardous materials may have occurred. Based on historical experience, the
company expects that a significant percentage of the total remediation and
compliance costs associated with the company’s facilities or former facilities
will continue to be allowable costs, and therefore reimbursed by the U.S.
government. Based on a site by site analysis, the company believes it has
adequate accruals for any liability it may incur arising from such sites at
which there is a known environmental condition, or Superfund or other
multi-party sites at which the company is a PRP.

Other

Various claims and other legal proceedings generally incidental to the
normal course of business are pending or threatened against the company. While
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, the company believes
its potential liabilities in these proceedings, individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material impact on the company’s results of
operations or financial condition.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of the company’s security holders
during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2001.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE COMPANY’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS

The company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Chicago Stock Exchange and Pacific Stock Exchange.

James D. Caldwell in connection with the company’s acquisition of Caldwell’s
Diving Company, Inc. and Cable Ventures Inc. (now known as it International
Telecom USA, Inc.). In connection with this share issuance, the company
claimed exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, based on the fact that the transaction did not involve any
public offering of securities.

The high and low sales prices of the company’s common stock and the cash
dividends declared with respect to the company’s common stock for each
quarterly period during the two most recent fiscal years are included in Note T
