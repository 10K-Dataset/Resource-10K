(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions; and shipbuilding and ship repair.

General Dynamics was incorporated in Delaware in 1952. The company grew organically and through acquisitions until the early 1990s when we sold nearly our entire portfolio except for our military-vehicle and submarine businesses. Starting in the mid-1990s, we began expanding again by acquiring Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, combat-vehicle-related businesses, IT product and service companies and additional shipyards, forming the foundation of our company today.

We continue to expand our business through organic growth and acquisitions. We focus on delivering superior products and services to our customers, and creating value for our shareholders through a relentless focus on operational excellence and continuous improvement.

Our company is organized into four business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Information Systems and Technology, and Marine Systems. Each group is comprised of two or more business units. Each unit has responsibility for its strategy and operational performance, providing the flexibility needed to stay close to customers, perform on programs and remain agile. Our corporate headquarters is responsible for setting the strategic direction and governance of the company, the allocation of capital and promoting a culture of ethics and integrity that defines how we operate. Our management team delivers on our commitments to shareholders through disciplined execution of our robust backlog, efficient cash-flow conversion and prudent capital deployment. We focus on managing costs, implementing continuous improvement initiatives and collaborating across our businesses to achieve our goals of maximizing earnings and cash and driving return on invested capital.

Following is additional information on each of our business groups. Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2017, as discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. For selected financial information, see Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

AEROSPACE

Our Aerospace group is at the forefront of the business-jet industry. We deliver a family of Gulfstream aircraft and provide a range of services for Gulfstream aircraft and aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The Aerospace group is known for:

•

superior aircraft design, quality, performance, safety and reliability;

•

technologically advanced cockpit and cabin systems; and

•

industry-leading product service and support.


At Gulfstream, we design, develop, manufacture, service and support the world’s most technologically advanced business-jet aircraft. Our product line includes aircraft across a spectrum of price and performance options in the large- and mid-cabin business-jet market. The varying ranges, speeds and cabin dimensions of these aircraft are well-suited for the needs of a diverse, global customer base.

We invest in Gulfstream to introduce new products and first-to-market enhancements that broaden customer choice, improve aircraft performance and set new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity. We created a new market with the G650 family of business jets. The G650 is the fastest non-supersonic aircraft to circumnavigate the globe, having flown westbound around the world in a record-setting 41 hours and 7 minutes. The G650 and G650ER have claimed 70 world speed records. The G650 also earned the National Aeronautic Association’s Robert J. Collier Trophy, an annual award recognizing the greatest achievement in U.S. aeronautics or astronautics with respect to improving performance, efficiency and safety. In 2017, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of the G650’s type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its entry into service. Today, there are more than 280 G650 and G650ER aircraft operating in 40 countries.

Our newest Gulfstream products are two clean-sheet large-cabin business jets, the G500 and G600, which exemplify our commitment to performance, safety, efficiency and innovation. The aircraft are progressing through concurrent flight-test programs in preparation for FAA certification. Five G500 test aircraft have completed more than 4,200 test hours since first flight in 2015, and five G600 aircraft have accumulated more than 1,300 test hours since first flight in 2016. Both aircraft have exceeded original expectations throughout our rigorous flight test program. In late 2017, we announced increased performance standards for both aircraft. At Mach 0.85, the G500 can fly 5,200 nautical miles, and the G600 can fly 6,500 nautical miles. The performance of these aircraft demonstrate our culture of continuous improvement and the discipline and rigor inherent in our design, development and flight-test programs.

Our product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, renewable fuels, flight-control systems, acoustics, cabin technologies and vision systems. One example is the Symmetry Flight Deck introduced with the G500 and G600, which includes 10 touchscreens and active control sidesticks, a first for business aviation. The touchscreens improve how pilots interact with onboard systems, and the sidesticks are digitally linked to allow both pilots to see and feel each other’s control inputs, enhancing situational awareness and further improving safety of the aircraft.

Gulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including manufacturing all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin model is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in the group’s U.S. facilities. In support of Gulfstream’s growing aircraft portfolio and customer base, we continue to invest in our facilities. At our Savannah campus, we have constructed facilities, including purpose-built G500, G600 and G650 manufacturing facilities; increased aircraft service capacity; and opened a new product-support distribution center and dedicated research and development centers.

The group offers extensive support for the more than 2,600 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world with the largest factory-owned service network in the business-aviation industry, including professionals located around the globe. The service network for Gulfstream aircraft continues to evolve to address the demands of our growing customer base. We operate 12 company-owned service centers worldwide and have more than 20 factory-authorized service centers and authorized warranty facilities. We also operate a 24-hour-per-day/365-day-per-year Customer Contact Center and offer on-call Gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy for customer-service requirements, providing maintenance support on every continent.

Jet Aviation has been a global leader in business aviation services for 50 years, providing comprehensive services and an extensive network of locations for aircraft owners and operators. With approximately 30


airport facilities throughout Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East and North America, our service offerings include maintenance, fixed-base operations (FBO), aircraft management, charter and staffing services.

In response to customer demand and the growing installed base of aircraft around the world, we have expanded Jet Aviation’s service network over the past several years and continue to do so. We are expanding our maintenance and FBO facility in Singapore, and in 2017 we opened a new FBO and hangar in Bedford, Massachusetts, and an FBO facility in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. We also took over the management of an FBO at Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and we acquired an FBO at Washington Dulles International Airport that has six hangars, 10 acres of ramp space and a newly renovated FBO terminal building.

In addition to these capabilities, Jet Aviation offers custom complex completions for narrow- and wide-body aircraft. We are expanding our Basel, Switzerland, facility to accommodate increased demand for wide-body completions and refurbishments.

As a market leader in the business-aviation industry, the Aerospace group is focused on developing innovative first-to-market technologies and products; providing exemplary and timely service to customers globally; and driving efficiencies in the aircraft production, outfitting and service processes.

We have a long history as one of the primary shipbuilders for the Navy, constructing and delivering ships and designing and developing next-generation platforms. More than 90% of the group’s revenue is for Navy engineering, construction and lifecycle support awarded under large, multi-year contracts.

We are the prime contractor for the Navy’s Virginia-class submarine program. Designed for the full range of global mission requirements, these stealthy boats excel in littoral and open-ocean environments. The Navy is procuring Virginia-class submarines in multi-boat blocks. Electric Boat continues to operate at a two submarines-per-year construction rate. We have delivered 15 Virginia-class submarines in conjunction with an industry partner that shares in the construction, and the remaining 13 submarines under contract are scheduled for delivery through 2023. Since delivering the lead Virginia-class submarine, the cost and time to deliver follow-on ships has been reduced consistently and significantly, from 84 months to 66 months, while improving the mission capability and quality of the ships at delivery.

We are also developing the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) for the fifth block of Virginia-class submarines expected to start construction in 2019. This block of submarines will provide a significant upgrade in size and performance. The VPM is an 84-foot hull section that will add four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and preserving the United States’ critical undersea capabilities.

The group is the prime contractor for design and construction of the Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, a 12-boat program that the Navy considers its top priority. These submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades and will begin to come on line when the current Ohio-class fleet reaches the end of its service life starting in 2027. The lead ship is slated to start construction in 2021, with delivery to the Navy in 2027. We were awarded a contract in 2017 to finish the design and begin prototype development of the lead boat, an important step to keep the program on schedule. We are investing in our workforce and facilities, including a new automated frame and cylinder facility in Quonset Point, Rhode Island. Steel for the first Columbia-class hull was cut in 2016, and missile tubes are under construction to


support the Common Missile Compartment work under joint development for the U.S. Navy and the U.K. Royal Navy.

We are the lead designer and builder of the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyers, managing the design, modernization and lifecycle support. These highly capable, multi-mission ships provide offensive and defensive capabilities and are capable of simultaneously fighting air, surface and subsurface battles. The Navy restarted this program in 2010 after a four-year break in construction and Bath Iron Works delivered the first ship in the restart program to the Navy in 2017. We have construction contracts for seven DDG-51s scheduled for delivery through 2024.

Bath Iron Works is one of the Navy’s contractors involved in the development and construction of the Zumwalt-class (DDG-1000) platform, the Navy’s next-generation guided-missile destroyer. These ships are equipped with numerous technological enhancements, including a low radar profile, an integrated power system and a software environment that ties together nearly every system on the ship. DDG-1000s will provide independent forward presence and deterrence, support special operations forces, and operate as an integral part of joint and combined expeditionary forces. We delivered the first ship in 2016. The second ship is expected to deliver in 2018 with the final ship scheduled for delivery in 2020.

NASSCO is building Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) auxiliary support ships, a second variant of the Expeditionary Support Dock (ESD) ships, which serve as floating forward staging bases to improve the Navy and Marine Corps’ ability to deliver large-scale equipment and expeditionary forces to areas without adequate port access. ESBs, equipped with a 52,000-square-foot flight deck and accommodations for up to 250 personnel, are capable of supporting a variety of missions, including airborne mine countermeasure, maritime security operations and disaster relief missions.

The group has delivered three ships in the program, and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships, scheduled for delivery in early 2018 and 2019, respectively.

NASSCO was awarded

a design and construction contract

in 2016

for the lead ship in the Navy’s new class of fleet oilers, the John Lewis class (TAO-205), along with options for five additional ships

. Designed to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships operating at sea, the oilers will have the capacity to carry 156,000 barrels of fuel as well as offer a significant dry cargo capacity and aviation capability. Engineering and design work is underway for the first ship, with construction scheduled to begin in late 2018.

Our Marine Systems group provides comprehensive ship and submarine maintenance, modernization and lifecycle support services to extend the service life and maximize the value of these ships. NASSCO conducts full-service maintenance and surface-ship repair operations in four primary locations within the Navy’s largest U.S. ports and at customer locations around the globe. Electric Boat provides submarine maintenance and modernization services in a variety of U.S. locations, and Bath Iron Works provides lifecycle support services for Navy surface ships. In support of allied navies, the group offers program management, planning, engineering and design support for submarine and surface-ship construction programs.

In addition to our work for the Navy, the Marine Systems group has extensive experience in all phases of ship construction for commercial customers, designing and building oil and product tankers and container and cargo ships for commercial markets since the 1970s. These ships help our commercial customers satisfy the Jones Act requirement that ships carrying cargo between U.S. ports be built in U.S. shipyards. The group has advanced commercial shipbuilding technology with NASSCO’s design and delivery of the world’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered containerships, using green ship technology to dramatically decrease emissions while increasing fuel efficiency. From 2014 to 2017, NASSCO constructed and delivered eight LNG-conversion-ready product tankers for commercial customers. During this time, the company achieved several first-time milestones, including a record throughput of 60,000 tons of steel per year and the delivery


of six ships in 2016. We are currently designing and constructing two new LNG-capable containerships with roll-on, roll-off capability with deliveries scheduled for 2019 and 2020.

To further the group’s goals of operating efficiency, innovation and affordability for the customer, we make strategic investments in our business, often in cooperation with the Navy. In addition, the Marine Systems group leverages its design and engineering expertise across its shipyards to improve program execution and generate cost savings. This knowledge sharing enables the group to use resources more efficiently and drive process improvements. We are well-positioned to continue to fulfill the ship-construction and support requirements of our customers.

U.S. GOVERNMENT

Our primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and first-responder agencies. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows:

*  In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer.

Our U.S. government businesses operate under fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. These fees are determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.

We conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services and maintaining long-term relationships with their customers.

Our non-U.S. commercial business consists primarily of business-jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. The market for business-jet aircraft and related services outside North America has expanded significantly in recent years. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from non-U.S. customers represent a significant segment of our aircraft business with approximately

55%

of the Aerospace group’s total backlog on

December 31, 2017

.

COMPETITION

Several factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business-aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:

•

the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;

•

our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;

•

successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;

•

our global footprint and accessibility to customers;

•

the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and

•

the successful management of customer relationships.

DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION

The U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other large platform and system-integration contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Combat Systems group competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Information Systems and Technology group competes with many companies, from large defense companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. Our Marine Systems group has one primary


competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program. The operating cycle of many of our major platform programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.

We are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.

BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION

The Aerospace group has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.

The Aerospace group competes worldwide in the business-jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of price, quality and timeliness. In our maintenance, repair and FBO businesses, the group competes with several other large companies as well as a number of smaller companies, particularly in the maintenance business. In our completions business, the group competes with several service providers.

BACKLOG

Our total backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts and includes funded and unfunded portions. For additional discussion of backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.

Summary backlog information for each of our business groups follows:

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

To foster innovative product development and evolution, we conduct sustained R&D activities as part of our normal business operations. Most of our Aerospace group’s R&D activities support Gulfstream’s product enhancement and development programs. In our U.S. defense businesses, we conduct customer-sponsored R&D activities under government contracts and company-sponsored R&D activities, investing in technologies and capabilities that provide innovative solutions for our customers. In accordance with government regulations, we recover a portion of company-sponsored R&D expenditures through overhead


charges to U.S. government contracts. For more information on our company-sponsored R&D activities, including our expenditures for the past three years, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.

EMPLOYEES

On

December 31, 2017

, our subsidiaries had

98,600

employees, approximately

one-fifth

of whom work under collective agreements with various labor unions and worker representatives. Agreements covering approximately

2%

of total employees are due to expire in


. Historically, we have renegotiated these labor agreements without any significant disruption to operating activities.

RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIERS AND SEASONALITY

We depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier on some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could impact our ability to meet our customer commitments. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale, and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts. We have not experienced, and do not foresee, significant difficulties in obtaining the materials, components or supplies necessary for our business operations.

Our business is not seasonal in nature. The receipt of contract awards, the availability of funding from the customer, the incurrence of contract costs and unit deliveries are all factors that influence the timing of our revenue. In the United States, these factors are influenced by the federal government’s budget cycle based on its October-to-September fiscal year.

REGULATORY MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

U.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal


Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:

•

acquisition planning,

•

competition requirements,

•

contractor qualifications,

•

protection of source selection and vendor information, and

•

acquisition procedures.

In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews covering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.

NON-U.S. REGULATORY

Our non-U.S. revenue is subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.

BUSINESS-JET AIRCRAFT

The Aerospace group is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which often is accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.

ENVIRONMENTAL

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, generally we seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.

Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. Environmental costs often are recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.


AVAILABLE INFORMATION

We file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.

Investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. The market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. There are some risks that apply more specifically to our business.

Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government. This customer relationship involves some specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our U.S. and non-U.S. defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems.

The U.S. government provides a significant portion of our revenue.

In 2017, approximately 60% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government. Levels of U.S. defense spending are driven by threats to national security. Competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. Decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance.

For additional information relating to the U.S. defense budget, see the Business Environment section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.

U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay.

Our U.S. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an October-to-September fiscal year. Early each calendar year, the President of the United States presents to Congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the Executive branch. For the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of Congress review the President’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.

There are two primary risks associated with the U.S. government budget cycle. First, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted, which has occurred in recent years. If the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the U.S. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for


our programs and timing of new awards. Second, Congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. Future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. Changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content.

Our U.S. government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer.

U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. If a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. The government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. The termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings.

Government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the U.S. government.

Numerous U.S. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. In some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. In some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. Moreover, new laws, regulations or standards, or changes to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability.

Our Aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft.

The

business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by corporate, individual and government customers in the United States and around the world. The Aerospace group’s results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. In addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially.

Earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts.

When agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. The accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. These projections and estimates assess:

•

the productivity and availability of labor,

•

the complexity of the work to be performed,

•

the cost and availability of materials and components, and

•

schedule requirements.

If there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. This could affect earnings and margin materially.


Earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance.

We rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. Subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. Misconduct by subcontractors, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue and earnings. We manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues. We sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. Our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities.

Sales and operations outside the United States are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries.

In some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. Our non-U.S. business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government’s budgets, leadership and national priorities, which may occur suddenly. Non-U.S. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. Our non-U.S. business is subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-U.S. business.

In addition, some non-U.S. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. We may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties. Offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers.

Many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. Some new products, particularly in our Aerospace group, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. If we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.

We have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties.

When evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures,


we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. These factors could materially adversely affect our financial results.

Changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired.

Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group. We face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions.

We face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology (IT) infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. We also design and manage IT systems and products that contain IT systems for various customers. We generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems. In addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business. Accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats. We have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our IT systems. Such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future threats could, among other things, cause harm to our business and our reputation; disrupt our operations; expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers; and impact our results of operations materially. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(Dollars in millions, except per-share amounts or unless otherwise noted)

For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of our major products and services, see the Business discussion contained in Item 1. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

On February 12, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSRA for $40.75 per share in cash. The transaction is valued at $9.6 billion, including the assumption of $2.8 billion in CSRA debt. We anticipate financing the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt financing. We will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2018. The forward-looking statements contained in Item 7 do not include any estimated amounts for the CSRA acquisition and any associated impacts.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

With approximately 60% of our revenue from the U.S. government, our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending. Over the past several years, U.S. defense spending has been mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). The BCA establishes spending caps over a 10-year period through 2021.

On February 9, 2018, the Congress approved increases to the BCA spending caps and a budget for fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019. The FY 2018 defense budget totals $700 billion, which includes $629 billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified BCA spending caps and $71 billion for overseas contingency operations, representing an increase of more than 10% over FY 2017 spending levels. The FY 2019 defense budget totals $716 billion. However, federal agencies and programs do not receive funding at the new levels until the corresponding appropriations bills are approved. The Congress has not yet passed the FY 2018 defense appropriation bill. As a result, we have been operating under a series of continuing resolutions (CRs), which have funded government agencies at FY 2017 spending levels, since the beginning of the government’s fiscal year. As of the filing of this Form 10-K on February 12, 2018, the current CR, signed into law on February 9, 2018, funds the government through March 23, 2018. We do not anticipate that these CRs will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to the U.S. military’s funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution.

International demand for military equipment and information technologies presents opportunities for our non-U.S. operations and exports from our North American businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, there are risks to doing business in foreign countries, including changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country.

In our Aerospace group, we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio. We expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support


the Aerospace group’s long-term growth. Similarly, we believe the aircraft services business will be a strong source of revenue as the global business-jet fleet grows.

Across our portfolio, we focus on expanding operating earnings and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash. We emphasize effective program execution and the flexibility and agility to respond to changing circumstances in our business environment, and look for opportunities to drive cost reduction across our business.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

An understanding of our accounting practices is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statements and operating results. The following paragraphs explain how we recognize revenue and operating costs in our business groups. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which we adopted on January 1, 2017. Prior-period information has been restated for the adoption as further discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In the Aerospace group, we record revenue on contracts for new aircraft

when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft

. Revenue associated with the group’s completions of other original equipment manufacturers’ (OEMs) aircraft and the group’s services businesses is recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Fluctuations in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries, progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period.

The majority of the Aerospace group’s operating costs relate to new aircraft production on firm orders and consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots, recorded in inventory and recognized as operating costs at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group’s completions and services businesses are recognized generally as incurred.

For new aircraft, operating earnings and margin are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft, and the mix of large-cabin and mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Additional factors affecting the group’s earnings and margin include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the volume of and market for pre-owned aircraft, and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the group.

In the three defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized generally over time as the work progresses, either as the products are produced or as services are rendered.

Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses.

Variances in costs recognized from period to period reflect primarily increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual


contracts. Because costs are used as a measure of progress, year-over-year variances in cost result in corresponding variances in revenue, which we generally refer to as volume.

Operating earnings and margin in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on adjustments to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These adjustments result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete the contract or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period compared with prior periods do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion on a given contract change without a corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work. Additionally, higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production).

REVIEW OF


VS.


Our consolidated revenue increased in


driven by higher volume across our Combat Systems group and increased revenue from aircraft deliveries and aircraft services in our Aerospace group. These increases


were offset partially by lower C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions revenue in our Information Systems and Technology group.

While revenue increased, operating costs and expenses decreased, resulting in an 11.9% increase in operating earnings and margin growth of 130 basis points. Operating earnings and margin expanded at each of our business groups in


.

REVIEW OF


VS.


Revenue was down in


due to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries in our Aerospace group. This decrease was offset partially by higher C4ISR solutions volume in our Information Systems and Technology group. Operating costs and expenses decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in


, resulting in a 130 basis-point decrease in consolidated operating margin compared with 2015. Operating margin decreased in the Aerospace, Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups.

REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS

*  Corporate operating results consist primarily of stock option expense.

Following is a discussion of operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed by specific types of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the lines of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group’s results. Additional information regarding our business groups can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.


AEROSPACE

Review of


vs.


The increase in the Aerospace group’s revenue in


consisted of the following:

Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultra-large-cabin G650 and mid-cabin G280 aircraft. This growth was offset in part by a decrease in the number of G450 and G550 large-cabin aircraft deliveries as we transition from the production of these models to the new G500 and G600, which are scheduled to enter into service in 2018. We also had three fewer pre-owned aircraft sales in


compared with


(five versus eight). Aircraft services revenue increased, driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the small acquisition of a fixed-base operation (FBO) in 2017.

The increase in the group’s operating earnings in


consisted of the following:

Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions earnings were up due to favorable cost performance and mix of ultra-large- and large-cabin aircraft deliveries. G&A/other expenses were higher in


due primarily to increased R&D expenses associated with ongoing product-development efforts as the group progresses with the certification of the G500 and G600. Overall, the Aerospace group’s operating margin increased


basis points to 19.6%.

Review of


vs.



The Aerospace group’s revenue and operating earnings decreased in


due primarily to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries. Operating earnings also decreased in


due to a supplier settlement received in 2015 associated with aircraft component design and delivery delays. Partially offsetting these decreases, the group’s aircraft services revenue and operating earnings increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an aircraft management and charter services provider in 2016. Aircraft services operating earnings were particularly strong in


due to a favorable mix of work and labor efficiencies. Additionally, the group’s 2016 operating earnings were impacted favorably by lower G&A/other expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives. Overall, the Aerospace group’s operating margin decreased 170 basis points to 18%.


Outlook

We expect the Aerospace group’s


revenue to increase between 2 and 3% from


. Operating margin is expected to be 18%, down slightly from


as a result of mix shift as the group transitions to the new G500 and G600 aircraft as well as higher pre-owned aircraft sales.

COMBAT SYSTEMS

Review of


vs.


The increase in the Combat Systems group’s revenue in


consisted of the following:

Revenue was up across the Combat Systems group in


. Revenue from U.S. military vehicles increased due to higher volume on the Army’s Abrams and Stryker programs, including work to produce Abrams M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3 (SEPv3) tanks and upgrade Stryker vehicles with an integrated 30-millimeter cannon and additional upgrades. Weapons systems and munitions revenue was up due primarily to increased production of several products, including bombs and Hydra-70 rockets for the U.S. government. Revenue from international military vehicles increased due to the ramp up in production on the British AJAX armoured fighting vehicle program and several international light armored vehicle (LAV) programs, offset largely by lower revenue on a large combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East as the group transitions from engineering to production.

The Combat Systems group’s operating margin increased 80 basis points driven by improved operating performance across the group’s portfolio. Operating earnings in


included the impact of a loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program.


Review of


vs.


The Combat Systems group’s revenue decreased in


due primarily to lower international military vehicles revenue driven by decreased volume on the large combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East and the timing of work on the group’s contract to upgrade and modernize LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army. These decreases were offset partially by higher volume on the group’s contract to deliver Piranha vehicles to the Danish Ministry of Defense.

The Combat Systems group’s operating margin decreased 70 basis points in


due primarily to the loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program. The impact of this loss was offset partially by favorable contract mix and improved operating performance.


Outlook

We expect the Combat Systems group’s 2018 revenue to increase between 3 and 4% from 2017. Operating margin is expected to be in the mid- to high-15% range.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

Review of


vs.


The change in the Information Systems and Technology group’s revenue in


consisted of the following:

C4ISR solutions revenue decreased as a result of funding delays across a number of programs, including the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T) mobile communications network and Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) computing and communications equipment programs, caused by the seven-month FY 2017 CR. Revenue decreased slightly in our IT services business due to delays in procurement activities across a number of programs, particularly in our federal civilian business, offset largely by the acquisition in late 2017 of a provider of mission-critical support services.

Despite the lower revenue, operating earnings increased, and operating margin expanded 110 basis points. The margin growth was driven primarily by strong program performance and favorable contract mix across the portfolio.


Review of


vs.


Revenue in the Information Systems and Technology group was up in


driven by higher volume across the C4ISR solutions business, including the WIN-T program and several programs in Canada and the United Kingdom. Revenue decreased in our IT services business driven by lower volume on our health solutions programs, including less contact-center services work for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The group’s operating margin increased 30 basis points in


driven primarily by improved operating performance. Operating earnings in 2015 included a gain of $23 on the sale of a commercial cyber security product business. Excluding the impact of this gain on the prior-year period, the group’s operating margin increased 50 basis points in


.


Outlook

We expect the Information Systems and Technology group’s


revenue to increase between 5 and 6% from


, with operating margin around 11%.

MARINE SYSTEMS

Review of


vs.


The change in the Marine Systems group’s revenue in


consisted of the following:

Revenue was down from Jones Act commercial ship construction following the delivery of six ships in 2016 and two ships in 2017. Revenue from U.S. Navy ship construction decreased due to timing on the Virginia-class submarine program offset partially by higher volume on the Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) program. Revenue from U.S. Navy ship engineering, repair and other services increased in


due primarily to additional work related to the Columbia-class submarine development program and Virginia-class submarine design enhancements, and a higher volume of submarine repair work.

The Marine Systems group’s operating margin increased 120 basis points due primarily to the 2016 impact of cost growth associated with the restart of the Navy’s DDG-51 program. The group’s operating margin was also affected favorably in 2017 by a decrease in lower-margin commercial ship work.


Review of


vs.


Revenue increased in the Marine Systems group in


due primarily to additional development work on the Columbia-class submarine program, offset partially by lower Jones Act commercial ship construction volume.

Operating margin decreased 190 basis points in


due to the DDG-51 program cost growth discussed above. Additionally, operating earnings in 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on Block III of the Virginia-class submarine program.


Outlook

We expect the Marine Systems group’s 2018 revenue to increase between 5 and 6% from 2017. Operating margin is expected to be in the mid- to high-8% range.

CORPORATE

Corporate costs totaled

$49

in


,

$40

in


and

$41

in


and consisted primarily of stock option expense. Corporate operating costs in


will be impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-07 on January 1, 2018. ASU 2017-07 requires the non-service cost components of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost (e.g., interest cost) to be reported in other income (expense) in the income statement. In our three defense groups, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs are allocable contract costs. For these groups, we will report the adjustment for the non-service cost components in Corporate operating results. This amount will offset our stock option expense, resulting in expected Corporate operating costs in


of essentially zero. For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

OTHER INFORMATION

PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUE AND OPERATING COSTS

Review of


vs.



The increase in product revenue in


consisted of the following:

Military vehicle production revenue increased due to higher volume on the U.S. Army’s Abrams and Stryker programs and the ramp up in production on the AJAX and several international LAV programs. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenue increased due to additional deliveries of the ultra-large-cabin G650 and mid-cabin G280 aircraft. These increases were offset largely by decreased ship construction revenue driven by timing on the Virginia-class submarine program and reduced Jones Act commercial ship construction volume, and decreased revenue from C4ISR products driven by funding delays caused by the extended FY 2017 CR.

While product revenue was steady in 2017, product operating costs decreased due to strong operating performance in our Aerospace and Information Systems and Technology groups and the impact of DDG-51 program cost growth in 2016 in our Marine Systems group.

The increase in service revenue in


consisted of the following:

Revenue from ship engineering, repair and other services increased due primarily to additional work related to the Columbia-class submarine development program and Virginia-class submarine design enhancements, and a higher volume of submarine repair work. Aircraft services revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of an FBO in 2017.

Service operating costs increased in


at a lower rate than revenue due primarily to strong operating performance in our Information Systems and Technology group.

Review of


vs.



The change in product revenue in


consisted of the following:

Product revenue decreased due primarily to fewer G550 and G450 large-cabin and G280 mid-cabin aircraft deliveries, and decreased Jones Act commercial ship construction volume. Revenue from C4ISR products increased due primarily to higher volume on the WIN-T program. Product operating costs decreased at a lower rate than revenue declined in


due to DDG-51 program cost growth in our Marine Systems group. Additionally, 2015 benefited from favorable cost performance on Block III of the Virginia-class submarine program in our Marine Systems group and a supplier settlement received in our Aerospace group.

The increase in service revenue in


consisted of the following:

Service revenue increased due primarily to additional development work on the Columbia-class submarine program. Service operating costs increased in


consistent with the higher volume described above.

G&A EXPENSES

As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses were

6.5%

in


,

6.3%

in


and

6.1%

in


. We expect G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in


to be generally consistent with


.

INTEREST, NET

Net interest expense was

$103

in


,

$91

in


and

$83

in


. The increase in


was due primarily to a $500 net increase in long-term debt beginning in the third quarter of 2016. We expect


net interest expense to be approximately $115. The increase from


is due primarily to slightly higher interest rates on the

$1 billion

of fixed-rate notes issued in 2017 compared with the

$900

of fixed-rate notes that matured in 2017. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including interest rates.

OTHER, NET

Net other income was

$3

in


,

$13

in


and

$7

in


. In


, we expect net other expense to be approximately $60 due primarily to the adoption of ASU 2017-07, which requires the non-service cost components of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost to be reported in other income (expense) in the income statement. For further discussion of the adoption of ASU 2017-07, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.


PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX, NET

Our effective tax rate was

28.6%

in


,

26.7%

in


and

28%

in


. The effective tax rate in 2017 includes a $119 unfavorable impact, or 290 basis points, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 (tax reform). The primary impact of the change in tax law was the remeasurement of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences are realized/settled (remeasured at a rate of 21% versus 35% for the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities). The decrease in the effective tax rate in


was due to increased international activity, as well as excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation recognized as an income tax benefit in accordance with ASU 2016-09. We adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis beginning in 2016. For further discussion, including a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

For


, we anticipate a full-year effective tax rate of approximately

19%

. The expected decrease from


is due primarily to the reduction of the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018, and the net impact of other tax reform provisions, notably a lower tax rate on income earned from foreign sales of U.S.-produced goods and services. However, the 2017 tax reform eliminated certain tax benefits under the prior tax law, including the domestic production deduction. Further, our non-U.S. businesses, which previously provided a benefit to our effective tax rate, operate in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates that are now similar to the U.S., and in some cases higher. For these reasons, while we continue to expect an effective tax rate slightly below the statutory rate, the difference between the rates is expected to narrow under the new tax law.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX

In 2013, we settled litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in the company’s former tactical military aircraft business. In connection with the settlement, we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at our Bath, Maine, shipyard. As we progressed through the shipbuilding process, we determined that the cost associated with this settlement was greater than anticipated. Therefore, in 2016, we recognized an

$84

loss, net of tax, to adjust the previously-recognized settlement value. In addition, we recognized a

$10

loss, net of tax, in 2016 related to an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company.

In 2015, we completed the sale of our axle business in the Combat Systems group. In 2016, we recognized a final adjustment of

$13

to the loss on the sale of this business.


BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE

Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was

$63.2 billion

at the end of


, up 1.6% from

$62.2 billion

at the end of


. Our total backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under contracts that meet the criteria in ASC Topic 606 as discussed in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our total estimated contract value, which combines total backlog with estimated potential contract value, was

$88 billion

on

December 31, 2017

.

AEROSPACE

Aerospace funded backlog represents new aircraft and custom completion orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The group ended


with backlog of

$12.5 billion

compared with

$13.2 billion

at year-end


.


Orders in


reflected solid demand across our product and services portfolio with especially strong orders in the fourth quarter of 2017. The book-to-bill ratio (orders divided by revenue) was one-to-one for Gulfstream aircraft in 2017. We received orders for all models of in-production Gulfstream aircraft, as well as additional orders for the G500 and G600 aircraft.

Beyond total backlog, estimated potential contract value in the Aerospace group was

$2 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, down slightly from

$2.1 billion

at year-end


. Estimated potential contract value represents primarily options to purchase new aircraft and long-term aircraft services agreements.

Demand for Gulfstream aircraft remains strong across customer types and geographic regions, generating orders from public and privately held companies, individuals, and governments around the world. Geographically, U.S. customers represented 55% of the group’s orders in


and approximately 45% of the group’s backlog on

December 31, 2017

, demonstrating continued strong domestic demand.

DEFENSE GROUPS

The total backlog in our three defense groups represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the U.S. Congress and funded by customers, as well as commitments by international customers that are approved and funded similarly by their governments. We have included in total backlog firm contracts at the amounts that we believe are likely to receive funding, but there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide the same funding level currently anticipated for a given program.

Estimated potential contract value in our defense groups includes unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts and work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts. Contract options in our defense business represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order. For IDIQ contracts, we evaluate the amount of funding we expect to receive and include this amount in our estimated potential contract value. This amount is often less than the total IDIQ contract value, particularly when the contract has multiple awardees. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value.

Total backlog in our defense groups was

$50.7 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, up 3.5% from

$49 billion

at the end of


, driven by a $5.1 billion contract awarded by the U.S. Navy to complete the design and prototype development of the Columbia-class submarine. Estimated potential contract value was

$22.8 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, compared with

$22.9 billion

at year-end


.


COMBAT SYSTEMS

The Combat Systems group’s total backlog was

$17.6 billion

at the end of


, down slightly from

$17.8 billion

at year-end


. The group’s backlog includes the amount of work remaining on two significant multi-year contracts awarded in 2014:

•

$5.9 billion to provide wheeled armored vehicles and logistics support to a Middle Eastern customer through 2024.

•

$4.1 billion from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to produce AJAX armoured fighting vehicles scheduled for delivery to the British Army through 2024 and related in-service support.

The group also has additional international military vehicle production contracts in backlog, notably:

•

$540 for LAVs for several non-U.S. customers, including $350 for the upgrade and modernization of LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army.

•

$430 to produce over 300 armored personnel carriers for the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization.

•

$355 to upgrade Duro tactical vehicles for the Swiss government through 2022.

•

$190 to produce Piranha 3+ vehicles in five variants and provide associated program support for an international customer.

The group received $1.9 billion of orders for Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies in


, ending the year with backlog of $2.1 billion. For the Army, backlog included $620 to produce M1A2 SEPv3 tanks, deliver M1A2 SEP components, and provide associated program support, and $365

to design and develop SEPv4 prototypes with upgraded sensors

. For U.S. allies, backlog included $825 to modernize Abrams main battle tanks for Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. An additional $870 for Abrams tank programs is included in our estimated potential contract value at year-end.

The U.S. Army’s Stryker wheeled combat-vehicle program represented $510 of the group’s backlog on

December 31, 2017

, with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2019. The group received $500 of Stryker orders in


, including awards to produce double-V-hull vehicles, upgrade vehicles with an integrated 30-millimeter cannon and provide support and engineering services.


The Combat Systems group’s backlog on

December 31, 2017

, also included $2.6 billion for multiple weapons systems and munitions programs, including $360 to produce Hydra-70 rockets for the Army.

The group’s estimated potential contract value was

$3.2 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, compared with

$4.7 billion

at year-end


. Estimated potential contract value decreased in


due to a customer-directed restructuring of a combat-vehicle contract in the Middle East.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group’s backlog consists of thousands of contracts and is reconstituted each year with new programs and task order awards. The group’s total backlog was

$8.9 billion

at the end of


, up 4.8% from

$8.5 billion

at year-end


. This amount does not include

$14.9 billion

of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options on

December 31, 2017

. Funding of IDIQ contracts and options added

$4.6 billion

to the group’s backlog in


, over 50% of the group’s orders.

In 2017, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of one-to-one or higher for the fourth consecutive year driven by several significant contract awards during the year, including the following:

•

$590 from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for contact center services and cloud hosting support, with $275 remaining in backlog at year-end


.

•

$415 from the U.K. Ministry of Defence to design and develop the next-generation tactical communication and information system in the initial phase of the U.K.’s Morpheus program.

•

$310 from the U.S. Army for computing and communications equipment under the CHS-4 program. $340 of estimated potential contract value remains under this IDIQ contract.

The group’s backlog at year-end


also included the following key programs:

•

$815 for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) to provide integrated mission systems, training and support for Canadian marine helicopters.


•

$445 of support and modernization work for the intelligence community, the DoD and the Department of Homeland Security, including the New Campus East, U.S. Naval Air Warfare Center, Enterprise Transport and St. Elizabeths campus infrastructure programs.

•

$415 for combat and seaframe control systems for U.S. Navy Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).

•

$320 for the WIN-T mobile communications network program. The group received $305 of orders in


for additional Increment 2 equipment.

•

$300 to provide supply chain management services to the U.S. Department of State.

•

$260 to provide fire control system modifications for ballistic-missile (SSBN) submarines.

•

$200 for long-term support and capability upgrades for the U.K.’s Bowman tactical communication system.

MARINE SYSTEMS

The Marine Systems group’s backlog consists of long-term submarine and surface ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group’s book-to-bill ratio exceeded one-to-one in


, resulting in backlog growth of 6.6% from

$22.7 billion

at year-end


to

$24.2 billion

at the end of


.

The Virginia-class submarine program was the company’s largest program in


and the largest contract in the company’s backlog. The group’s backlog at year-end


included

$11.2 billion

for 13 Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2023.

Navy destroyer programs represented

$4 billion

of the group’s backlog at year-end


. We have construction contracts for seven DDG-51 destroyers scheduled for delivery through 2024. Backlog at year-end


also included two ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for delivery in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

The Marine Systems group’s backlog on

December 31, 2017

, included

$245

for construction of ESB auxiliary support ships.

The group has delivered three ships in the program, and construction is underway on the fourth and fifth ships, scheduled for delivery in early 2018 and 2019, respectively.


In 2016, we were awarded

a design and construction contract

for the lead ship in the Navy’s new class of fleet oilers, the John Lewis class (TAO-205), along with options for five additional ships

. At year-end


, backlog included

$670

for the program, and estimated potential contract value included

$2.2 billion

for the options.

The year-end backlog also included two liquefied natural gas (LNG)-capable Jones Act ships for a commercial customer scheduled for delivery through 2020.

Complementing these ship construction programs, engineering services represented approximately

$6.5 billion

of the Marine Systems group’s backlog on

December 31, 2017

. Design and development efforts on the Columbia-class submarine program represented

$5.3 billion

of this amount, driven by $5.1 billion awarded in 2017 to complete the design and prototype development of the Columbia-class submarine. An additional $1.2 billion is included in our estimated potential contract value at year end, representing materials to be provisioned on the contract.

Year-end backlog for ship and submarine maintenance, repair and other services totaled

$1.1 billion

, including $780 for surface-ship repair operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus gives us the flexibility for capital deployment while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. Cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to pay dividends, fund capital expenditures and business acquisitions, and repurchase our common stock.

(a)

Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of year end.

(b)

Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of year end.

We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Item 8.


OPERATING ACTIVITIES

We generated cash from operating activities of

$3.9 billion

in


,

$2.2 billion

in


and

$2.6 billion

in


. The primary driver of cash flows was net earnings.

Cash flows in 2016 and 2015 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our Combat Systems group due to the utilization of deposits and the timing of billings on a large contract for a Middle Eastern customer, and in our Aerospace group from the build-up of inventory related to the new G500 and G600 aircraft programs and the liquidation of customer deposits associated with aircraft deliveries. In 2017, the growth in operating working capital due to these factors slowed and was offset by lower income tax payments.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Cash used for investing activities was

$791

in


compared with cash used for investing activities of

$426

in


and cash provided by investing activities of

$200

in


. Our investing activities include cash paid for capital expenditures and business acquisitions; purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities; and proceeds from asset sales.

Capital Expenditures.

The primary use of cash for investing activities in all three years was capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were

$428

in


,

$392

in


and

$569

in


. We expect capital expenditures of around

2%

of revenue in


.

Business Acquisitions.

In


, we acquired

four

businesses for an aggregate of

$399

. In


, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate of

$58

. We did not acquire any businesses in 2015.

Marketable Securities.

In 2015, we received $500 of proceeds from maturing held-to-maturity securities purchased in 2014. Other net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities in all three years were not material.

Other, Net.

Investing activities also include proceeds from asset sales. In 2015, we completed the sale of our axle business in the Combat Systems group and a commercial cyber security business in our Information Systems and Technology group.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Cash used for financing activities was

$2.4 billion

in


,

$2.2 billion

in


and

$4.4 billion

in


. Our financing activities include repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and debt repayments. Net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from debt issuances and employee stock option exercises.

Share Repurchases.

Our board of directors authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market from time to time. We repurchased

7.8 million

of our outstanding shares for

$1.5 billion

in


,

14.2 million

shares for

$2 billion

in


and

22.8 million

shares for

$3.2 billion

in


. As a result, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately

11%

since the end of


. On

December 31, 2017

, 7.6 million

shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, approximately

3% of our total shares outstanding.

Dividends.

On March 1, 2017, our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of

$0.84

per share, the


th consecutive annual increase. Previously, the board had increased the quarterly dividend to

$0.76

per share in

March 2016

and

$0.69

per share in

March 2015

. Cash dividends paid were

$986

in


,

$911

in


and

$873

in


.


Debt Issuances and Repayments.

We issued

$1 billion

of fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of 2017, and we used the proceeds to repay

$900

of fixed-rate notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for general corporate purposes. In 2016, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes on their maturity date with cash on hand and issued $1 billion of fixed-rate notes for general corporate purposes. In 2015, we repaid $500 of fixed-rate notes on their scheduled maturity date with the proceeds from maturing marketable securities.

We have no additional material repayments of long-term debt scheduled until 2021. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities and interest rates.

On

December 31, 2017

, we had

no

commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future

. We have

$2 billion

in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. These credit facilities include a

$1 billion

multi-year facility expiring in

July 2018

and a

$1 billion

multi-year facility expiring in

November 2020

.

We may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates.

We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the

Securities and Exchange Commission

that allows us to access the debt markets

.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow from operations and ROIC to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures.

Free Cash Flow.

We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a key performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:

*  Prior-period information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for ASC Topic 606 and is, therefore, not comparable to the 2017, 2016 and 2015 information.


Return on Invested Capital.

We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance.

ROIC is calculated as follows:

*  Prior-period information for 2014 and 2013 has not been restated for ASC Topic 606 and is, therefore, not comparable to the 2017, 2016 and 2015 information.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

On

December 31, 2017

, other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on

December 31, 2017

:

(a)

Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of long-term debt.

(b)

Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes

$17.1 billion

of purchase obligations for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clauses.

(c)

Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management’s estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans. See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them.


*  See Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of letters of credit and aircraft trade-in options.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that

affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period

. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, pension and other post-retirement benefits, workers’ compensation, warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based

on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances

. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.

Actual results could differ from these estimates.

We believe our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented.

In our opinion, the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application:

Revenue.

The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606.

The unit of account in ASC Topic 606 is a performance obligation.

A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.

Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.

Substantially all of our revenue in the defense groups is recognized over time, because control is transferred continuously to our customers.

Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses.

The majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft in our Aerospace group. Revenue on these contracts is recognized

when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft

.

Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs.

For long-term contracts, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference


between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.

Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years.

These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.

The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and award and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. Because of our certainty in estimating these amounts, they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations.

As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts,

we

review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified.

Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.

The aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our

operating earnings (and diluted earnings per share) by

$323

(

$0.69

) in


,

$16

(

$0.03

) in


and

$271

(

$0.54

) in


. While

no adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in


,


or


, the amount in 2016 was negatively impacted by a loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program in our Combat Systems group and cost growth associated with the restart of the Navy’s DDG-51 program in our Marine Systems group.

Consistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year.

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

Long-lived Assets and Goodwill.

We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows.

Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.

We review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not.

Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of


estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations.

This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimates of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units’ fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting units’ fair values). Additionally, we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit’s fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer companies and recent comparable market transactions.

We completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of

December 31, 2017

.

The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value.

Our reporting units are consistent with our business groups

.

The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was well in excess of its respective carrying value as of

December 31, 2017

.

Commitments and Contingencies.

We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from

the normal course of business

or under provisions relating to

the protection of the environment

. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known.

Other Contract Costs.

Other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts, such as a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid.

We have elected to defer these costs

in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet

until they can be allocated to contracts.

We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts.

We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment.

If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected.

Retirement Plans.

Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on several assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions include interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets.

We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. Beginning in 2016, we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net annual benefit cost. Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above. Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment. We believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflows and


corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. In 2017, we decreased the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our primary U.S. government and commercial pension plans by 75 basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected long-term returns of our various asset classes.

These retirement plan assumptions

are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions.

In the event any of the assumptions change, pension and other post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For further discussion, including the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

As discussed under Other Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs until such costs can be allocated to contracts.

Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the

retirement benefit

cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.

Accounting Standards Updates.

See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in


and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) but are not effective until after

December 31, 2017

.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of these risks. The following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

We had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of

$4.3 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, and

$6.3 billion

on

December 31, 2016

.

In 2017, we changed our method for calculating the hypothetical, incremental pretax gains (losses) to measure the net gains (losses) for each currency pair across our portfolio of forward exchange contracts (e.g., Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar), rather than measure the gains (losses) on a contract-by-contract basis. The underlying portfolio and the associated exchange-rate risk have not changed. We restated the 2016 amount under the new method to provide comparability between 2017 and 2016.

A

10%

unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax gains (losses):

Foreign Currency.

Our exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the Canadian dollar, euro and British pound exchange rates. These losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk.

Interest Rate Risk.

Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. On

December 31, 2017

, we had

$4 billion

par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. Our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. A

10%

unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations.

Investment Risk.

Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to

five years

. On

December 31, 2017

, we held

$3 billion

in cash and equivalents, but held no

marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers’ compensation and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans

. On

December 31, 2017

,

these marketable securities totaled

$191

and were reflected at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

.

A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization.

General Dynamics is organized into

four

business groups: Aerospace, which delivers Gulfstream aircraft and provides services for Gulfstream aircraft and aircraft produced by other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); Combat Systems, which designs and manufactures combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; Information Systems and Technology, which provides C4ISR (command, control, communication, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions and information technology (IT) services; and Marine Systems, which designs, constructs and repairs surface ships and submarines. Our primary customer is the U.S. government. We also do significant business with non-U.S. governments and a diverse base of corporate and individual buyers of business aircraft.

Basis of Consolidation and Classification.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Dynamics Corporation and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. We eliminate all inter-company balances and transactions in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some prior-year amounts have been reclassified among financial statement accounts or disclosures to conform to the current-year presentation.

Consistent with industry practice, we classify assets and liabilities related to long-term contracts as current, even though some of these amounts may not be realized within one year.

Further discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in the other notes to these financial statements.

Use of Estimates.

The nature of our business requires that we make estimates and assumptions in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These estimates and assumptions

affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period

. We base our estimates

on historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances

.

Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax.

In 2013, we settled litigation with the U.S. Navy related to the terminated A-12 aircraft contract in the company’s former tactical military aircraft business. In connection with the settlement, we released some rights to reimbursement of costs on ships under contract at our Bath, Maine, shipyard. As we progressed through the shipbuilding process, we determined that the cost associated with this settlement was greater than anticipated. Therefore, in 2016, we recognized an

$84

loss, net of tax, to adjust the previously-recognized settlement value. In addition, we recognized a

$10

loss, net of tax, in 2016 related to an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company.

In 2015, we completed the sale of our axle business in the Combat Systems group. In 2016, we recognized a final adjustment of

$13

to the loss on the sale of this business.

Research and Development Expenses.

Company-sponsored research and development (R&D) expenses, including product development costs, were

$521

in


,

$418

in


and

$395

in


. The increase in 2017 is due primarily to higher R&D expenses in the Aerospace group associated with ongoing product-development efforts as the group progresses with the certification of its two newest aircraft models, the G500 and G600. R&D expenses are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated


Statement of Earnings in the period in which they are incurred. Customer-sponsored R&D expenses are charged directly to the related contracts.

The Aerospace group has cost-sharing arrangements with some of its suppliers that enhance the group’s internal development capabilities and offset a portion of the financial cost associated with the group’s product development efforts. These arrangements explicitly state that supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur in the development of new aircraft models and technologies, and we retain substantial rights in the products developed under these arrangements. We record amounts received from these cost-sharing arrangements as a reduction of R&D expenses. We have no obligation to refund any amounts received under the agreements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Under the typical terms of an agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are based on milestones and are recognized as received. Our policy is to defer payments in excess of the costs we have incurred.

Interest, Net.

Net interest expense consisted of the following:

Cash and Equivalents and Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider securities with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits rated A-/A3 or higher. Our investments in other securities are included in other current and noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note E). We report our held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost. We report our available-for-sale securities at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. We had

no

trading securities on

December 31, 2017

or


.

Cash flows in 2016 and 2015 were affected negatively by growth in operating working capital in our Combat Systems group due to the utilization of deposits and the timing of billings on a large contract for a Middle Eastern customer, and in our Aerospace group from the build-up of inventory related to the new G500 and G600 aircraft programs and the liquidation of customer deposits associated with aircraft deliveries. In 2017, the growth in operating working capital due to these factors slowed and was offset by lower income tax payments.

Other Contract Costs.

Other contract costs represent amounts that are not currently allocable to government contracts, such as a portion of our estimated workers’ compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid.

We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts.

If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected.

Other contract costs on

December 31, 2017

and


, were

$448

and

$699

, respectively, and are included

in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet

.

Long-lived Assets and Goodwill.

We review long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of undiscounted projected cash flows. Impairment losses, where identified, are measured as the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived asset over its estimated fair value as determined by discounted projected cash flows.


We review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not.

Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.

The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit and then, if necessary, measure the amount of the impairment loss.

Our reporting units are consistent with our business groups

in Note R.

We completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of

December 31, 2017

.

The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based primarily on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations.

The estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was well in excess of its respective carrying value as of

December 31, 2017

. For a summary of our goodwill by reporting unit, see Note C.

Accounting Standards Updates.

On January 1, 2017, we retrospectively adopted the following accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that impacted our prior-period financial statements:

•

ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

•

ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

See Note T for further discussion of each of these accounting standards.

We also adopted ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, on January 1, 2017. We recognized the cumulative effect of this standard as a

$3

decrease to retained earnings on the date of adoption. ASU 2016-16 requires recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs, as opposed to former GAAP, which required companies to defer the income tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers until the asset was sold to an outside party. The income tax effects of intra-entity inventory transfers will continue to be deferred until the inventory is sold.

There are several new accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB but are not effective until after December 31, 2017, including the following:

•

ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. Specific to our business, ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU eliminates the available-for-sale classification for equity investments that recognized changes in fair value as a component of other comprehensive income. We adopted the standard on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

•

ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. We adopted the standard retrospectively on January 1, 2018. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material effect on our cash flows.

•

ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires the service cost component of net benefit cost to be reported separately from the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement. The ASU also allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. We adopted the standard retrospectively on January 1, 2018. Our reported


2017 operating earnings, when restated, will increase

$59

due to the reclassification of the non-service cost components of net benefit cost, and our reported other income will decrease by the same amount, with no impact to net earnings. The area of the ASU related to capitalization did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

•

ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease rights and obligations as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Previously, lessees were not required to recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities arising from operating leases. The ASU also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective on January 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective method of adoption as of January 1, 2017. In January 2018, the FASB issued an exposure draft of the proposed ASU, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements. The proposed ASU provides an alternative transition method of adoption, permitting the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption.

We intend to adopt the standard on the effective date, but have not yet selected a transition method. We are currently evaluating our population of leased assets in order to assess the impact of the ASU on our lease portfolio, and designing and implementing new processes and controls. Until this effort is completed, we cannot determine the effect of the ASU on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

•

ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. ASU 2017-12 is intended to simplify hedge accounting by better aligning an entity’s financial reporting for hedging relationships with its risk management activities. The ASU also simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. For cash flow hedges existing at the adoption date, the standard requires adoption on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption. The amendments to presentation guidance and disclosure requirements are required to be adopted prospectively. We have not yet determined the effect of the ASU on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, nor have we selected a transition date.

Subsequent Event.

On

February 12, 2018

, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSRA for

$40.75

per share in cash. The transaction is valued at

$9.6 billion

, including the assumption of

$2.8 billion

in CSRA debt. We anticipate financing the transaction through a combination of available cash and new debt financing. We will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions, including antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of CSRA common stock. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first half of 2018.

B. REVENUE

The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts and programs that can span several years. We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606.

Performance Obligations.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASC Topic 606.

A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.

The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct. Some of our contracts have multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phases of the product lifecycle (development, production, maintenance


and support). For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service.

Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.

Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.

Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time accounted for

71%

of our revenue in


,

72%

in


and

68%

in


.

Substantially all of our revenue in the defense groups is recognized over time, because control is transferred continuously to our customers.

Typically, revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, overhead and, when appropriate, G&A expenses.

Revenue from goods and services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for

29%

of our revenue in


,

28%

in


and

32%

in


.

The majority of our revenue recognized at a point in time is for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft in our Aerospace group. Revenue on these contracts is recognized

when the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft

.

On December 31, 2017, we had

$63.2 billion

of remaining performance obligations, which we also refer to as total backlog. We expect to recognize approximately

40%

of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2018, an additional

40%

by 2020 and the balance thereafter.

Contract Estimates.

Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs.

For long-term contracts, we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract.

Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years.

These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer.

The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and award and incentive fees. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. These estimates are based on historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. Because of our certainty in estimating these amounts, they are included in the transaction price of our contracts and the associated remaining performance obligations.


As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts,

we

review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified.

Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.

If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.

The impact of adjustments in contract estimates on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating costs and expenses or revenue.

The aggregate impact of adjustments in contract estimates increased our

revenue, operating earnings and diluted earnings per share as follows:

While

no adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements in


,


or


, the amount in 2016 was negatively impacted by a loss on the design and development phase of the AJAX program in our Combat Systems group and cost growth associated with the restart of the Navy’s DDG-51 program in our Marine Systems group.

Revenue by Category.

Our portfolio of products and services consists of almost

10,000

active contracts. The following series of tables presents our revenue disaggregated by several categories.

Revenue by major products and services was as follows:


Revenue by contract type was as follows:

Each of these contract types presents advantages and disadvantages. Typically, we assume more risk with fixed-price contracts. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less than originally estimated. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated base fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixed-price contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, our profit may vary if actual labor-hour rates vary significantly from the negotiated rates. Also, because these contracts can provide little or no fee for managing material costs, the content mix can impact profitability.


Revenue by customer was as follows:

Contract Balances.

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In our defense groups, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers, particularly on our international contracts, before revenue is recognized, resulting in contract liabilities.

These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

In our Aerospace group, we generally receive deposits from customers upon contract execution and upon achievement of contractual milestones. These deposits are liquidated


when revenue is recognized. Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the year ended December 31, 2017, were not materially impacted by any other factors.

Revenue recognized in


,


and


that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year was

$4.3 billion

,

$4.2 billion

and

$6 billion

, respectively. This revenue represented primarily the sale of business-jet aircraft.

C. ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Acquisitions.

In


, we acquired

four

businesses for an aggregate of

$399

: a fixed-base operation (FBO) in our Aerospace group; and a manufacturer of electronics and communications products, a provider of mission-critical support services and technology solutions, and a manufacturer of signal distribution products in our Information Systems and Technology group. In


, we acquired an aircraft management and charter services provider in our Aerospace group and a manufacturer of unmanned underwater vehicles in our Information Systems and Technology group for an aggregate of

$58

. We did not acquire any businesses in 2015.

The operating results of these acquisitions have been included with our reported results since the respective closing dates. The purchase prices of the acquisitions have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill.

Goodwill.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit were as follows:

(a)

Goodwill in the Information Systems and Technology reporting unit is net of

$2 billion

of accumulated impairment losses.

(b)

Includes adjustments during the purchase price allocation period.

(c)

Consists primarily of adjustments for foreign currency translation.

Intangible Assets.

Intangible assets consisted of the following:

(a)

Change in gross carrying amounts consists primarily of adjustments for acquired intangible assets and foreign currency translation.

(b)

Consists of acquired backlog and probable follow-on work and associated customer relationships.


We did not recognize any impairments of our intangible assets in


,


or


. The amortization lives (in years) of our intangible assets on

December 31, 2017

, were as follows:

Amortization expense was

$79

in


,

$88

in


and

$116

in


. We expect to record annual amortization expense over the next five years as follows:

D. EARNINGS PER SHARE

We compute basic earnings per share (EPS) using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic weighted average shares outstanding have decreased in


and


due to share repurchases. See Note M for further discussion of our share repurchases. Diluted EPS incorporates the additional shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and the release of restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs).

Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were as follows (in thousands):

*  Excludes outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock that had exercise prices in excess of the average market price of our common stock during the year and, therefore, the effect of including these options would be antidilutive. These options totaled

1,547

in


,

4,201

in


and

1,706

in


.

E. FAIR VALUE

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants. Various valuation approaches can be used to determine fair value, each requiring different valuation inputs. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:

•

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly; and

•

Level 3 - unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.


We did not have any significant non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on

December 31, 2017

or


.

Our financial instruments include cash and equivalents and other investments, accounts receivable and payable, short- and long-term debt, and derivative financial instruments. The carrying values of cash and equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, and short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair value. The following tables present the fair values of our other financial assets and liabilities on

December 31, 2017

and


, and the basis for determining their fair values:

(a)

We had no Level 3 financial instruments on

December 31, 2017

or


.

(b)

Determined under a market approach using valuation models that incorporate observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields and quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.

F. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Provision.

We calculate our provision for federal, state and international income taxes based on current tax law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and has several key provisions impacting accounting for and reporting of income taxes. The most significant provision reduces the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from

35%

to

21%

beginning on January 1, 2018. Although most provisions of tax reform are not effective until 2018, we are required to record the effect of a change in tax law in the period of enactment (2017).

The provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in


included a

$119

unfavorable impact from the change in tax law. The impact is due primarily to the remeasurement of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary differences are realized/settled (remeasured at a rate of

21%

versus

35%

for the majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities). The other key provision that requires recognition in the period of enactment is the one-time toll charge resulting from the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign taxable income. As it relates to our operations, there was no impact in


from the mandatory deemed repatriation as we had no net undistributed foreign taxable income subject to the toll charge.

We have obtained and analyzed all necessary information to record the effect of the change in tax law, and do not anticipate reporting additional tax effects in the future. However, should the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issue further guidance or interpretation of relevant aspects of the new tax law, we may adjust these amounts.


The following is a summary of our net provision for income taxes for continuing operations:

The reported tax provision differs from the amounts paid because some income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax purposes. State and local income taxes allocable to U.S. government contracts are included in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and, therefore, are not included in the provision above.

The reconciliation from the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate follows:


Net Deferred Tax Asset (Liability).

The tax effects of temporary differences between reported earnings and taxable income consisted of the following:

Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in other noncurrent assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our net deferred tax asset (liability) consisted of the following:

We believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our deferred tax assets, subject to the valuation allowances recognized.

Our retirement benefits deferred tax balance includes a deferred tax asset of

$1 billion

on

December 31, 2017

, and

$1.7 billion

on

December 31, 2016

, related to the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) to recognize the funded status of our retirement plans. See Notes M and Q for additional details.

One of our deferred tax liabilities results from our participation in the Capital Construction Fund (CCF), a program established by the U.S. government and administered by the Maritime Administration that supports the acquisition, construction, reconstruction or operation of U.S. flag merchant marine vessels. The program allows us to defer federal and state income taxes on earnings derived from eligible programs as long as the proceeds are deposited in the fund and withdrawals are used for qualified activities. We had U.S. government accounts receivable pledged (and thereby deposited) to the CCF of

$692

and

$388

on

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

On

December 31, 2017

, we had net operating loss carryforwards of

$1 billion

that begin to expire in 2019, a capital loss carryforward of

$234

that expires in 2020 and tax credit carryforwards of

$123

that begin to expire in 2018.


Tax Uncertainties.

For all periods open to examination by tax authorities, we periodically assess our liabilities and contingencies based on the latest available information. Where we believe there is more than a

50%

chance that our tax position will not be sustained, we record our best estimate of the resulting tax liability, including interest, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We include any interest or penalties incurred in connection with income taxes as part of income tax expense. The total amount of these tax liabilities on

December 31, 2017

, was not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We participate in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), a real-time audit of our consolidated federal corporate income tax return. The IRS has examined our consolidated federal income tax returns through 2016. We do not expect the resolution of tax matters for open years to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or effective tax rate.

Based on all known facts and circumstances and current tax law, we believe the total amount of any unrecognized tax benefits on

December 31, 2017

, was not material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, and if recognized, would not have a material impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, there are

no

tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will vary significantly over the next 12 months, producing, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

G. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable represent amounts billed and currently due from customers. Payment is typically received from our customers either at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Accounts receivable consisted of the following:

Receivables from non-U.S. government customers included amounts related to long-term production programs for the Spanish Ministry of Defence of

$2.1 billion

on

December 31, 2017

. A different ministry, the Spanish Ministry of Industry, has funded work on these programs in advance of costs incurred by the company. The cash advances are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in current customer advances and deposits and will be repaid to the Ministry of Industry as we collect on the outstanding receivables from the Ministry of Defence. The net amount for these programs on

December 31, 2017

, was an advance payment of

$284

. With respect to our other receivables, we expect to collect substantially all of the year-end


balance during


.

H. UNBILLED RECEIVABLES

Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized on long-term contracts (contract costs and estimated profits) less associated advances and progress billings. These amounts will be billed in accordance with the agreed-upon contractual terms or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Unbilled receivables consisted of the following:


The increase in net unbilled receivables was due primarily to the timing of billings on large international vehicle contracts in our Combat Systems group.

G&A costs in unbilled revenue on

December 31, 2017

and


, were

$282

and

$234

, respectively. Contract costs also may include estimated contract recoveries for matters such as contract changes and claims for unanticipated contract costs. We record revenue associated with these matters only when the amount of recovery can be estimated reliably and realization is probable.

We expect to bill all but approximately

20%

of our year-end


net unbilled receivables balance during


. The amount not expected to be billed in


results primarily from the agreed-upon contractual billing terms.

I.

INVENTORIES

The majority of our inventories are for business-jet aircraft. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Work in process represents largely labor, material and overhead costs associated with aircraft in the manufacturing process and is based primarily on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. Raw materials are valued primarily on the first-in, first-out method. We record pre-owned aircraft acquired in connection with the sale of new aircraft at the lower of the trade-in value or the estimated net realizable value.

Inventories consisted of the following:

J. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is carried at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The major classes of PP&E were as follows:


We depreciate most of our assets using the straight-line method and the remainder using accelerated methods. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over periods of up to

50 years

. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods of up to

30 years

. Our government customers provide certain facilities and equipment for our use that are not included above.

K. DEBT

Debt consisted of the following:

In the third quarter of


, we issued

$1 billion

of fixed-rate notes. We used the proceeds to repay

$900

of fixed-rate notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2017 and for general corporate purposes. Interest payments associated with our debt were

$93

in


,

$83

in


and

$90

in


.

Our fixed-rate notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by several of our


%-owned subsidiaries. See Note S for condensed consolidating financial statements. We have the option to redeem the notes prior to their maturity in whole or in part for the principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest and applicable make-whole amounts.


The aggregate amounts of scheduled principal maturities of our debt for the next five years are as follows:

On

December 31, 2017

, we had

no

commercial paper outstanding, but we maintain the ability to access the commercial paper market in the future

. We have

$2 billion

in committed bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. These credit facilities include a

$1 billion

multi-year facility expiring in

July 2018

and a

$1 billion

multi-year facility expiring in

November 2020

.

We may renew or replace these credit facilities in whole or in part at or prior to their expiration dates.

Our bank credit facilities are guaranteed by several of our


%-owned subsidiaries.

We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the

SEC

that allows us to access the debt markets

.

Our financing arrangements contain a number of customary covenants and restrictions. We were in compliance with all covenants on

December 31, 2017

.

L. OTHER LIABILITIES

A summary of significant other liabilities by balance sheet caption follows:

(a)

Consists primarily of dividends payable, taxes payable, environmental remediation reserves, warranty reserves, deferred revenue and supplier contributions in the Aerospace group, liabilities of discontinued operations, and insurance-related costs.

(b)

Consists primarily of warranty reserves, workers’ compensation liabilities and liabilities of discontinued operations.

M. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Authorized Stock.

Our authorized capital stock consists of

500 million

shares of

$1

per share par value common stock and

50 million

shares of

$1

per share par value preferred stock. The preferred stock is


issuable in series, with the rights, preferences and limitations of each series to be determined by our board of directors.

Shares Issued and Outstanding.

On

December 31, 2017

, we had

481,880,634

shares of common stock issued and

296,895,608

shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted stock of

817,484

shares. On

December 31, 2016

, we had

481,880,634

shares of common stock issued and

302,418,528

shares of common stock outstanding.

No

shares of our preferred stock were outstanding on either date. The only changes in our shares outstanding during


and


resulted from shares repurchased in the open market and share activity under our equity compensation plans. See Note P for additional details.

Share Repurchases.

Our board of directors authorizes management’s repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market from time to time. On March 1, 2017, the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to

10 million

additional shares of the company’s outstanding stock. In


, we repurchased

7.8 million

. These AOCL components are included in our net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit cost. See Note Q for additional details.


N. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge some of these risks as described below. We had

$4.3 billion

in notional forward exchange contracts outstanding on

December 31, 2017

,

and

$6.3 billion

on

December 31, 2016

. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. See Note E for additional details.

Foreign Currency Risk and Hedging Activities.

Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and inter-company transactions denominated in foreign currencies. To the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk. Otherwise, we enter into derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts, designed to offset and minimize our risk. The dollar-weighted

three

-year average maturity of these instruments generally matches the duration of the activities that are at risk.

We record changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings or in other comprehensive loss (OCL) within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Gains and losses related to derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in OCL until the underlying transaction is reflected in earnings. We adjust derivative financial instruments not designated as cash flow hedges to market value each period and record the gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The gains and losses on these instruments generally offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities and other transactions being hedged. Gains and losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for all derivative financial instruments, regardless of designation.

Net gains and losses on derivative financial instruments recognized in earnings, including gains and losses related to hedge ineffectiveness, were not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. Net gains and losses reclassified to earnings from OCL were not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years, and we do not expect the amount of these gains and losses that will be reclassified to earnings in


to be material.

We had

no

material derivative financial instruments designated as fair value or net investment hedges on

December 31, 2017

or


.

Interest Rate Risk.

Our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. However, the risk associated with these instruments is not material.

Commodity Price Risk.

We are subject to rising labor and commodity price risk, primarily on long-term, fixed-price contracts. To the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from these risks. Some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivative financial instruments but are not accounted for separately, because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. We have not entered into any material commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. We do not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.

Investment Risk.

Our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to

five

years. On

December 31, 2017

, we held

$3 billion

in cash and equivalents, but held

no

marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some


of our obligations under workers’ compensation and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans

. On

December 31, 2017

,

these marketable securities totaled

$191

and were reflected at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in other current and noncurrent assets

.

Foreign Currency Financial Statement Translation.

We translate foreign currency balance sheets from our international businesses’ functional currency (generally the respective local currency) to U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, and statements of earnings at average exchange rates for each period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are a component of OCL.

We do not hedge the fluctuation in reported revenue and earnings resulting from the translation of these international operations’ results into U.S. dollars. The impact of translating our non-U.S. operations’ revenue into U.S. dollars was not material to our results of operations in any of the past three years. In addition, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on non-U.S. cash balances was not material in each of the past three years.

O. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

In 2015, Electric Boat Corporation, a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation, received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an investigation of potential False Claims Act violations relating to alleged failures of Electric Boat’s quality system with respect to allegedly non-conforming parts purchased from a supplier. In 2016, Electric Boat was made aware that it is a defendant in a lawsuit related to this matter filed under seal in U.S. district court. Also in 2016, the Suspending and Debarring Official for the U.S. Department of the Navy issued a Show Cause Letter to Electric Boat requesting that Electric Boat respond to the official’s concerns regarding Electric Boat’s oversight and management with respect to its quality assurance systems for subcontractors and suppliers. Electric Boat responded to the Show Cause Letter and has been engaged in discussions with the U.S. government. Given the current status of these matters, we are unable to express a view regarding the ultimate outcome or, if the outcome is adverse, to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss. Depending on the outcome of these matters, there could be a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Additionally, various other claims and legal proceedings incidental to

the normal course of business

are pending or threatened against us. These other matters relate to such issues as government investigations and claims,

the protection of the environment

, asbestos-related claims and employee-related matters. The nature of litigation is such that we cannot predict the outcome of these other matters. However, based on information currently available, we believe any potential liabilities in these other proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Environmental

We are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. Based on historical experience, we expect that a significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance costs associated with these facilities will continue to be allowable contract costs and, therefore, recoverable under U.S. government contracts.


As required, we provide financial assurance for certain sites undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation. We accrue environmental costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where applicable, we seek insurance recovery for costs related to environmental liabilities. We do not record insurance recoveries before collection is considered probable. Based on all known facts and analyses, we do not believe that our liability at any individual site, or in the aggregate, arising from such environmental conditions will be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what has been recorded would be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Minimum Lease Payments

Total expense under operating leases was

$309

in


,

$307

in


and

$283

in


. Operating leases are primarily for facilities and equipment. Future minimum lease payments are as follows:

Other

Government Contracts.

As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. government audits and investigations relating to our operations, including claims for fines, penalties, and compensatory and treble damages. We believe the outcome of such ongoing government audits and investigations will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

In the performance of our contracts, we routinely request contract modifications that require additional funding from the customer. Most often, these requests are due to customer-directed changes in the scope of work. While we are entitled to recovery of these costs under our contracts, the administrative process with our customer may be protracted. Based on the circumstances, we periodically file requests for equitable adjustment (REAs) that are sometimes converted into claims. In some cases, these requests are disputed by our customer. We believe our outstanding modifications, REAs and other claims will be resolved without material impact to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Letters of Credit and Guarantees.

In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other similar arrangements with financial institutions and insurance carriers totaling approximately

$1.2 billion

on

December 31, 2017

. In addition, from time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we contractually guarantee the payment or performance of our subsidiaries arising under certain contracts.

Aircraft Trade-ins.

In connection with orders for new aircraft in funded contract backlog, our Aerospace group has outstanding options with some customers to trade in aircraft as partial consideration in their new-aircraft transaction. These trade-in commitments are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the trade-in aircraft at a date generally


or fewer days preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer. At that time, the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow its expiration. Any excess of the pre-established trade-in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated as a reduction of revenue in the new-aircraft sales transaction.


Labor Agreements.

Approximately

one-fifth

of the employees of our subsidiaries work under collectively-bargained terms and conditions, including


collective agreements that we have negotiated directly with unions and works councils. A number of these agreements expire within any given year. Historically, we have been successful at renegotiating these labor agreements without any material disruption of operating activities. In


, we expect to negotiate the terms of


agreements covering approximately

2,000

employees. We do not expect the renegotiations will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Product Warranties.

We provide warranties to our customers associated with certain product sales. We record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is generally based on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion. Our other warranty obligations, primarily for business-jet aircraft, are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The changes in the carrying amount of warranty liabilities for each of the past three years were as follows:

*  Includes a cumulative-effect adjustment on January 1, 2015, which represents the impact of adopting ASC Topic 606.

P. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

Equity Compensation Overview.

We have equity compensation plans for employees, as well as for non-employee members of our board of directors. The equity compensation plans seek to provide an effective means of attracting and retaining directors, officers and key employees, and to provide them with incentives to enhance our growth and profitability. Under the equity compensation plans, awards may be granted to officers, employees or non-employee directors in common stock, options to purchase common stock, restricted shares of common stock, participation units or any combination of these.

Annually, we grant awards of stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to participants in our equity compensation plans in early March. Additionally, we may make limited ad hoc grants on a quarterly basis for new hires or promotions. We issue common stock under our equity compensation plans from treasury stock. On

December 31, 2017

, in addition to the shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, approximately

6 million

shares have been authorized for awards that may be granted in the future.

Equity-based Compensation Expense.

Equity-based compensation expense is included in G&A expenses. The following table details the components of equity-based compensation expense recognized in net earnings in each of the past three years:


Stock Options.

Stock options granted under our equity compensation plans are issued with an exercise price at the fair value of our common stock determined by the average of the high and low stock prices as listed on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. The majority of our outstanding stock options vest over

three

years, with

50%

of the options vesting after two years and the remaining

50%

vesting the following year, and expire


years after the grant date.

We recognize compensation expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are based on our historical forfeiture experience. We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for each of the past three years:

We determine the above assumptions based on the following:

•

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option.

•

Expected term is based on assumptions used by a set of comparable peer companies.

•

Risk-free interest rate is the yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option at the grant date.

•

Expected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend yield.

The resulting weighted average fair value per stock option granted (in dollars) was

$33.09

in


,

$22.11

in


and

$27.54

in


. Stock option expense reduced pretax operating earnings (and on a diluted per-share basis) by

$53

(

$0.11

) in


,

$39

(

$0.08

) in


and

$49

(

$0.10

) in


. Compensation expense for stock options is reported as a Corporate expense for segment reporting purposes (see Note R). On

December 31, 2017

, we had

$71

of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.8 years

.


A summary of stock option activity during


follows:

Summary information with respect to our stock options’ intrinsic value and remaining contractual term on

December 31, 2017

, follows:

In the table above, intrinsic value is calculated as the excess, if any, of the market price of our stock on the last trading day of the year over the exercise price of the options. For stock options exercised, intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was

$215

in


,

$263

in


and

$238

in


.

Restricted Stock/RSUs.

The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs equals the average of the high and low market prices of our common stock as listed on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Grants of restricted stock are awards of shares of common stock. Participation units represent obligations that have a value derived from or related to the value of our common stock. These include stock appreciation rights, phantom stock units and RSUs, and are payable in cash or common stock.

Restricted stock and RSUs generally vest over a

three

-year restriction period after the grant date, during which recipients may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise convey their restricted shares to another party. During this period, restricted stock recipients receive cash dividends on their restricted shares and are entitled to vote those shares, while RSU recipients receive dividend-equivalent units instead of cash dividends and are not entitled to vote their RSUs or dividend-equivalent units.

We grant RSUs with a performance measure derived from a non-GAAP-based management metric, return on invested capital (ROIC). Depending on the company’s performance with respect to this metric, the number of RSUs earned may be less than, equal to or greater than the original number of RSUs awarded subject to a payout range.

We generally recognize compensation expense related to restricted stock and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. Compensation expense related to restricted stock and RSUs reduced pretax operating earnings (and on a diluted per-share basis) by

$70

(

$0.15

) in


,

$56

(

$0.12

) in


and

$49

(

$0.10

) in


. Compensation expense for restricted stock and RSUs is reported as an operating expense of our business groups for segment reporting purposes (see Note R). On

December 31,



, we had

$47

of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.6 years

.

Q. RETIREMENT PLANS

We provide defined-contribution benefits to eligible employees, as well as some remaining defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits. Substantially all of our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year.

Retirement Plan Summary Information

Defined-contribution Benefits.

We provide eligible employees the opportunity to participate in defined-contribution savings plans (commonly known as 401(k) plans), which permit contributions on a before-tax and after-tax basis. Employees may contribute to various investment alternatives. In most of these plans, we match a portion of the employees’ contributions. Our contributions to these plans totaled

$274

in


,

$261

in


and

$240

in


. The defined-contribution plans held approximately

21 million

and

22 million

shares of our common stock, representing approximately

7%

of our outstanding shares on

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

Pension Benefits.

We have

seven

noncontributory and

five

contributory trusteed, qualified defined-benefit pension plans covering eligible government business employees, and

two

noncontributory and

four

contributory plans covering eligible commercial business employees, including some employees of our international operations. The primary factors affecting the benefits earned by participants in our pension plans are employees’ years of service and compensation levels. Our primary government pension plans, which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation, were closed to new salaried participants on January 1, 2007. Additionally, we made changes to these plans for certain participants effective in 2014 that limit or cease the benefits that accrue for future service. We made similar changes to our primary commercial pension plan in 2015.

We also sponsor

one

funded and several unfunded non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans, which provide participants with additional benefits, including excess benefits over limits imposed on qualified plans by federal tax law.

Other Post-retirement Benefits.

We maintain plans that provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employees and retirees. These benefits vary by employment status, age, service and salary level at retirement. The coverage provided and the extent to which the retirees share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company. The plans provide health and life insurance benefits


only to those employees who retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement.

Contributions and Benefit Payments

It is our policy to fund our defined-benefit retirement plans in a manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contributions considered within our capital deployment framework. Therefore, we may make discretionary contributions in addition to the required contributions determined in accordance with IRS regulations. We contributed

$199

to our pension plans in


. In


, our required contributions are approximately

$315

.

We maintain several tax-advantaged accounts, primarily Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts, to fund the obligations for some of our other post-retirement benefit plans. For non-funded plans, claims are paid as received. Contributions to our other post-retirement plans were not material in


and are not expected to be material in


.

We expect the following benefits to be paid from our retirement plans over the next 10 years:

Government Contract Considerations

Our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of contributions to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans covering employees working in our defense business groups. For non-funded plans, our government contracts allow us to recover claims paid. Following payment, these recoverable amounts are allocated to contracts and billed to the customer in accordance with the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and specific contractual terms. For some of these plans, the cumulative pension and other post-retirement benefit cost exceeds the amount currently allocable to contracts. To the extent recovery of the cost is considered probable based on our backlog and probable follow-on contracts, we defer the excess in other contract costs in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the cost is allocable to contracts. See Note A for a discussion of our other contract costs. For other plans, the amount allocated to contracts and included in revenue has exceeded the plans’ cumulative benefit cost. We have deferred recognition of these excess earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Defined-benefit Retirement Plan Summary Financial Information

Estimating retirement plan assets, liabilities and costs requires the extensive use of actuarial assumptions. These include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount projected benefit payments, healthcare cost trend rates and future salary increases. Given the long-term nature of the assumptions being made, actual outcomes can and often do differ from these estimates.

Our annual benefit cost consists of three primary elements: the cost of benefits earned by employees for services rendered during the year, an interest charge on our plan liabilities and an assumed return on our plan assets for the year. The annual cost also includes gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial


assumptions, differences between the actual and assumed long-term rate of return on assets, and gains and losses resulting from changes we make to plan benefit terms.

We recognize an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the funded status of each of our defined-benefit retirement plans. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and its benefit obligation. Changes in plan assets and liabilities due to differences between actuarial assumptions and the actual results of the plan are deferred in OCL rather than charged to earnings. These differences are then amortized over future years as a component of our annual benefit cost. We amortize actuarial differences under qualified plans on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of eligible employees. If all of a plan’s participants are inactive, we amortize these differences over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. We recognize the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets for qualified plans over

five

years. The deferral of these differences reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year-to-year changes in the assumptions or from actual results that are not necessarily representative of the long-term financial position of these plans. We recognize differences under nonqualified plans immediately.

Net annual defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit cost (credit) consisted of the following:


The following is a reconciliation of the benefit obligations and plan/trust assets, and the resulting funded status, of our defined-benefit retirement plans:

Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the following:

Amounts deferred in AOCL consisted of the following:


The following is a reconciliation of the change in AOCL for our defined-benefit retirement plans:

*  Includes foreign exchange translation, curtailment and other adjustments.

The following table represents amounts deferred in AOCL on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on

December 31, 2017

, that we expect to recognize in our retirement benefit cost in


:

A pension plan’s funded status is the difference between the plan’s assets and its projected benefit obligation (PBO). The PBO is the present value of future benefits attributed to employee services rendered to date, including assumptions about future compensation levels. A pension plan’s accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value of future benefits attributed to employee services rendered to date, excluding assumptions about future compensation levels. The ABO for all defined-benefit pension plans was

$13.9 billion

and

$12.7 billion

on

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively. On

December 31, 2017

and


, some of our pension plans had an ABO that exceeded the plans’ assets. Summary information for those plans follows:

Retirement Plan Assumptions

We calculate the plan assets and liabilities for a given year and the net annual benefit cost for the subsequent year using assumptions determined as of December 31 of the year in question.


The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations:

The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine our net annual benefit cost:

*  Not applicable as we changed to the spot rate approach beginning in 2016 as further described below.

We base the discount rates on a current yield curve developed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit payout period. Beginning in 2016, we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net annual benefit cost. Previously, the cost was determined using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above. Under the refined method, known as the spot rate approach, we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment. We believe this change provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflows and corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. We accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. In 2017, we decreased the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our primary U.S. government and commercial pension plans by 75


basis points following an assessment of the historical and expected long-term returns of our various asset classes.

Retirement plan assumptions

are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions.

Changes in these estimates impact future pension and other post-retirement benefit cost. As discussed above, we defer recognition of the cumulative benefit cost for our government plans in excess of costs allocated to contracts and included in revenue.

Therefore, the impact of annual changes in financial reporting assumptions on the

cost for these plans does not immediately affect our operating results.

For our U.S. pension plans that represent the majority of our total obligation, the following hypothetical changes in the discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets would have had the following impact in


:

A 25-basis-point change in these assumed rates would not have had a measurable impact on the benefit cost for our other post-retirement plans in


. For our healthcare plans, the effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate on the


net annual benefit cost is

$4

and

($3)

, respectively, and the effect on the

December 31, 2017

, accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation is

$75

and

($60)

, respectively.

Plan Assets

A committee of our board of directors is responsible for the strategic oversight of our defined-benefit retirement plan assets held in trust. Management develops investment policies and provides oversight of a third-party investment manager who reports to the committee on a regular basis.  The outsourced third-party investment manager develops investment strategies and makes all day-to-day investment decisions related to defined-benefit retirement plan assets in accordance with our investment policy and target allocation percentages.

Our investment policy endeavors to strike the appropriate balance among capital preservation, asset growth and current income. The objective of our investment policy is to generate future returns consistent with our assumed long-term rate of return used to determine our benefit obligations and net annual benefit cost. Target allocation percentages vary over time depending on the perceived risk and return potential of various asset classes and market conditions. At the end of


, our asset allocation policy ranges were:

More than

90%

of our pension plan assets are held in a single trust for our primary U.S. government and commercial pension plans. On

December 31, 2017

, the trust was invested largely in publicly traded equities, fixed-income securities and commingled funds comprised of equity securities. The trust also invests in other asset classes consistent with our investment policy. Our investments in equity assets include U.S. and international securities and equity funds. Our investments in fixed-income assets include U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed


securities. Our investment policy allows the use of derivative instruments when appropriate to reduce anticipated asset volatility, to gain exposure to an asset class or to adjust the duration of fixed-income assets.

Assets for our non-U.S. pension plans are held in trusts in the countries in which the related operations reside. Our non-U.S. operations maintain investment policies for their individual plans based on country-specific regulations. The non-U.S. plan assets are invested primarily in commingled funds comprised of equity and fixed-income securities.

We hold assets in VEBA trusts for some of our other post-retirement benefit plans. These assets are managed by a third-party investment manager with oversight by management and are generally invested in equities, fixed-income securities and commingled funds comprised of equity and fixed-income securities. Our asset allocation strategy for the VEBA trusts considers potential fluctuations in our other post-retirement benefit obligation, the taxable nature of certain VEBA trusts, tax deduction limits on contributions and the regulatory environment.

Our retirement plan assets are reported at fair value. See Note E for a discussion of the hierarchy for determining fair value. Our Level 1 assets include investments in publicly traded equity securities. These securities are actively traded and valued using quoted prices for identical securities from the market exchanges. Our Level 2 assets consist of fixed-income securities and commingled funds whose underlying investments are valued using observable marketplace inputs. The fair value of plan assets invested in fixed-income securities is generally determined using valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, bond yields, low-volume market quotes and quoted prices for similar assets. Our plan assets that are invested in commingled funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value (NAV) that is based on the underlying investments of the fund. Our Level 3 assets include real estate funds, insurance deposit contracts and direct private equity investments.

Certain investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These investments are redeemable at NAV on a monthly or quarterly basis and have redemption notice periods of up to

90 days

. We had

no

unfunded commitments related to these investments on

December 31, 2017

or


.


The fair value of our pension plan assets by investment category and the corresponding level within the fair value hierarchy were as follows:

(a)

No single equity holding amounted to more than

1%

of the total fair value.

(b)

Our corporate bond investments had an average rating of

A+

.

(c)

Investments measured at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table for these investments are included to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

R. BUSINESS GROUP INFORMATION

We operate in

four

business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Information Systems and Technology, and Marine Systems. We organize our business groups in accordance with the nature of products and services offered. We measure each group’s profitability based on operating earnings. As a result, we do not allocate net interest, other income and expense items, and income taxes to our business groups.

Summary financial information for each of our business groups follows:

*  Corporate operating results consist primarily of stock option expense.

*  Corporate identifiable assets are primarily cash and equivalents.


See Note B for additional revenue information by business group.

T. PRIOR-PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our prior-period financial statements were restated for the adoption of two ASUs that are discussed below.

ASC Topic 606.

We adopted ASC Topic 606 on January 1, 2017, using the retrospective method. The adoption of ASC Topic 606 had two primary impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of adjustments on profit recorded to date is now recognized in the period identified (cumulative catch-up method), rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term. For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we now recognize revenue at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer, generally upon delivery and acceptance of the fully outfitted aircraft. Prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606, we recognized revenue for these contracts at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft were completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepted final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft. The cumulative effect of the adoption was recognized as a decrease to retained earnings of

$372

on January 1, 2015.

We applied the standard’s practical expedient that permits the omission of prior-period information about our remaining performance obligations. No other practical expedients were applied.

ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.

We adopted ASU 2015-17 on January 1, 2017, using the retrospective method. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in reclassifications among accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but had no other impacts on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The following tables summarize the effects of adopting these accounting standards on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

December 31, 2017

and


, the related Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Shareholders’ Equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, and the related notes (collectively, the Consolidated Financial Statements). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2017

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated

February 12, 2018

, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

(b)

Fourth-quarter 2017 includes a $119 unfavorable one-time, non-cash impact resulting from the December 2017 change in tax law further discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders of General Dynamics Corporation:

The management of General Dynamics Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

. In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on our evaluation we believe that, as of

December 31, 2017

, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

KPMG LLP has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The KPMG report immediately follows this report.

December 31, 2017

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

December 31, 2017

, and the related notes (collectively, the Consolidated Financial Statements), and our report dated

February 12, 2018

, expressed an unqualified opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

no

changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
