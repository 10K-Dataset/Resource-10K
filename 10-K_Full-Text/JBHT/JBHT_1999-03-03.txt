PART I
ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
GENERAL
     J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned
subsidiaries ("JBH" or the "Company"), is a diversified transportation services
and logistics company operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) and various state regulatory agencies. JBH is an Arkansas
holding company incorporated on August 10, 1961. Through its subsidiaries JBH
provides a wide range of logistics and transportation services to a diverse
group of customers. The Company directly manages or provides tailored,
technology-driven solutions to a growing list of Fortune 500 companies. These
customers may request specifically targeted transportation service or outsource
their entire logistics function to JBH. The Company also directly transports
full-load containerizable freight throughout the continental United States and
portions of Canada and Mexico. Transportation services may utilize JBH equipment
and employees, or may employ equipment and services provided by unrelated third
parties in the transportation industry. The Company presently has three distinct
operating segments: Van/Intermodal ("VAN"); J.B. Hunt Logistics ("JBHL"); and
Dedicated Contract Services ("DCS"). See Note (9) Segment Information of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     VAN
     Primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include
full truck-load, dry-van, containerizable freight which is typically
transported utilizing company-owned revenue equipment. Freight is picked up at
the dock or specified location of the shipper and transported directly to the
location of the consignee. The load may be transported entirely by company-owned
and controlled power equipment or a portion of the movement may be handled by a
third-party motor carrier or a railroad. Approximately 45% of VAN revenue in
1998 was transported by a railroad for a portion of the movement. If any portion
of a movement is handled by a railroad, the entire amount billed to the customer
is considered to be intermodal revenue. Typically, the charges for the entire
movement are billed to the customer by the Company and the Company, in turn,
pays the railroad or third-party for their portion of the transportation
services provided. In 1993, rail operations were expanded to utilize
newly-designed high-cube containers which can be separated from the chassis and
double-stacked on rail cars to provide improved productivity. Freight may be
transported by rail utilizing traditional trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) medium for a
portion of the line-haul, or containers separated from the chassis,
double-stacked on railcars and moved as container-on-flatcar (COFC). The Company
has agreements with nine different railroads and substantially all of the
freight carried under these rail arrangements receives priority space on trains
and preferential loading and unloading service at rail facilities.

     JBH VAN has certain Canadian authorities which were initially granted in 
1988 and may transport freight to and from all points in the continental 
United States to Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. The Company has 
authorization to operate directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date 
has served limited points in Canada, primarily through interchange operations 
with Canadian motor carriers. The Company has provided transportation 
services to and from Mexico since 1989, primarily through interchange 
operations with various Mexican motor carriers. A joint venture agreement 
with Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, one of the largest transportation 
companies in Mexico, was signed in 1992. At December 31, 1998, VAN operated 
approximately 6,700 tractors and 32,420 trailers/containers. VAN gross 
operating revenues were $1,379 million in 1998, an increase of 19% over 1997.

     JBHL
     The Company formally began offering transportation logistics services in 
1992. JBHL services typically refer to an arrangement whereby a shipper may 
outsource a substantial portion of or their entire distribution and 
transportation process to one organization. JBHL provides a wide range of 
comprehensive transportation and management services including experienced 
professional managers, information and optimization technology, and the 
actual design or redesign of system solutions. A new JBHL customer or 
arrangement may require a significant amount of up-front analysis and design 
time while alternatives are considered and custom systems and software are 
developed. Once a logistics arrangement is in place, JBHL may utilize VAN 
and/or DCS owned and controlled transportation equipment, unrelated 
third-party equipment and employees, or a combination to meet the customer's 
service requirements. JBHL gross operating revenues were $317 million in 
1998, an increase of 25% over 1997.



     DCS
     The Company began formally offering dedicated contract services in 1992. 
DCS operations typically include company-owned revenue equipment and employee 
drivers that are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service. 
The service is engineered and customized for the specific customer and is 
typically in accordance with a written, long-term agreement. Frequently DCS 
operations provide service to customers that wish to augment or outsource 
their private fleet. It is common for one customer's dedicated service 
requirements to relate to limited traffic lanes or freight moving in only one 
direction. As a result, DCS operations frequently utilize VAN freight to 
provide backhauls which allow equipment to be repositioned for the DCS 
customer's next movement. The DCS and VAN segments also frequently share 
facilities such as terminals, maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations and 
trailer pools. At December 31, 1998, DCS operated approximately 2,200 
tractors and 2,950 trailers. DCS gross operating revenues were $212 million 
in 1998, an increase of 41% over 1997.

     OTHER
     Prior to 1996, the Company had operated additional businesses including 
a flatbed division, a business that transported small parcels, and a division 
that specialized in the transportation of hazardous commodities. In early 
1996, the Company embarked upon a strategy to concentrate its efforts on VAN, 
JBHL and DCS. In accordance with that strategy, assets and operations of 
other service offerings were subsequently sold. The small parcel and 
hazardous commodities businesses were sold in 1996 and the flatbed business 
was sold in 1997.

MARKETING AND OPERATIONS
     JBH transports a wide range of products including automotive parts, 
department store merchandise, paper and wood products, food and beverages, 
plastics, chemicals and manufacturing materials and supplies. The Company's 
primary customers include many of the "Fortune 500" companies, but no single 
customer accounted for more than 7% of revenues during 1998. A broad 
geographic dispersion and a good balance in the type of freight transported 
allow JBH some protection from major seasonal fluctuations. However, 
consistent with the truckload industry in general, freight is typically 
stronger during the second half of the year, with peak volume occurring in 
August through mid November. Revenue and earnings are also affected by bad 
weather, holidays, fuel prices and railroad service levels.

     The Company generally markets all three of its service offerings through 
a nationwide marketing network. All transportation services offered are 
typically billed directly to the customer by JBH and all inquiries, claims 
and other customer contacts are handled by the Company. Certain marketing, 
sales, engineering and design functions are assigned to each operating 
segment. However, marketing strategy, pricing and national account service 
coordination is managed at the corporate level.

PERSONNEL
     At December 31, 1998, JBH employed approximately 14,250 people, 
including 10,500 drivers. Historically the truckload transportation industry 
and the Company have experienced shortages of qualified drivers. In addition, 
driver turnover rates for truckload motor carriers frequently exceed 100%. In 
September of 1996, J.B. Hunt announced a new compensation program for the 
approximate 3,500 over-the-road VAN drivers. This comprehensive package, 
which was effective February 25, 1997, included an average 33% increase in 
wages for this group of employees. This program was designed to attract and 
retain a professional and experienced work force capable of delivering a high 
level of customer service. As anticipated, this increase in driver wages and 
benefits was partially offset by lower driver recruiting and training 
expense, reduced accident costs and better equipment utilization. The average 
driver turnover in the VAN business was 46% in 1998 and 45% in 1997, down 
from 86% in 1996. Drivers are frequently designated as local, regional, 
regular route or dedicated and over-the-road and typically compensated on a 
rate-per-mile basis, a rate per week basis or a combination of factors. JBH 
also employed approximately 2,550 office personnel and 1,200 mechanics at 
December 31, 1998. No employees are represented by collective bargaining 
agreements and management believes that its relationship with its employees 
is excellent.



REVENUE EQUIPMENT
     At December 31, 1998, JBH owned approximately 8,900 tractors and operated
12,980 trailers and 22,390 containers. JBH believes that modern, late-model,
clean equipment differentiates quality customer service, increases equipment
utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime. Accordingly, the average
age of the VAN tractor and trailing fleet was approximately two years and four
years, respectively, at December 31, 1998. In 1993, the Company commenced
receiving a newly-designed container and chassis combination that could be
transported over the road by truck and also be moved by rail or ship. The
container and chassis may be transported as a single unit by rail (TOFC) or the
container can be separated from the chassis and double-stacked (COFC) on rail
cars or ships for improved productivity. Containers comprised approximately 70%
of the VAN trailing fleet at December 31, 1998. The composition of the dedicated
contract fleet varies with specific customer service requirements. All JBH
revenue equipment is maintained in accordance with a specific maintenance
program primarily based on age and miles traveled. The JBHL business is
non-asset based, since the revenue equipment is provided by VAN, DCS and third
parties.

COMPETITION
     JBH is the largest publicly held truckload carrier in the United States. It
competes primarily with other irregular route, truckload common carriers.
Less-than-truckload common carriers and private carriers generally provide
limited competition for truckload carriers. JBH is one of a few carriers
offering nationwide logistics management and dedicated revenue equipment
services. Although a number of carriers may provide competition on a regional
basis, only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets.
The extensive rail network developed in conjunction with the various railroads
also allows the Company the opportunity to differentiate its services in the
marketplace.

REGULATION
     Prior to December of 1995, the Company's operations in interstate commerce
were regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC"). Commencing in
January of 1996, the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act closed the
ICC and transferred all remaining regulatory responsibilities to a new Surface
Transportation Board and to the Federal Highway Administration. Motor carrier
operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States
DOT governing interstate operation. Such matters as weight and dimension of
equipment and commercial driver's licensing are also subject to federal and
state regulations. A federal requirement that all drivers obtain a commercial
driver's license became effective in April 1992.

     The federal Motor Carrier Act of 1980 was the start of a program to 
increase competition among motor carriers and limit the level of regulation 
in the industry (sometimes referred to as "deregulation"). The Motor Carrier 
Act of 1980 enabled applicants to obtain operating authority more easily and 
allowed interstate motor carriers, such as the Company, to change their rates 
by a certain percentage per year without approval. The new law also allowed 
for the removal of many route and commodity restrictions regarding the 
transportation of freight. As a result of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the 
Company was able to obtain unlimited authority to carry general commodities 
throughout the 48 contiguous states. Effective January 1, 1995, the federal 
government issued guidelines which allow motor carriers more flexibility in 
intrastate operations. Although this reduced level of state regulation 
increased the level of competition in some regions, the Company believes it 
has ultimately benefited from this legislation.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

     The Company's corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. A 
150,000-square-foot building was constructed and occupied in September 1990. 
In addition to the corporate headquarters, the Company owns a separate 
40-acre tract in Lowell, Arkansas with three separate buildings totaling 
18,000 square feet of office space and 80,000 square feet of maintenance and 
warehouse space. These buildings serve as the Lowell operations terminal, 
tractor and trailer maintenance facilities and additional administrative 
offices. A new terminal and maintenance facility was constructed and occupied 
in Chicago, Illinois during 1996. A new terminal and maintenance facility was 
also constructed and occupied in Kansas City, Missouri during early 1999.



A summary of the Company's principal facilities follows:


In addition to the above facilities, the Company leases numerous small 
offices and trailer parking yards in various locations throughout the country.



ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising 
from the normal conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of the 
facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes 
the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the 
Company.

ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 1998 to a vote of 
security holders.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION 

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with 
the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and related footnotes 
appearing in this annual report.

SUMMARY OF 1998
     J.B. Hunt's 1998 financial and operating results reflected a number of 
positive trends when compared with 1997. For the first time since 1996, the 
Company experienced a net increase in the tractor fleet. A 9% increase in VAN 
tractor count and a 17% increase in the VAN driver force during 1998 
contributed to a 19% increase in VAN segment revenue. Intermodal revenue, 
which is included in the VAN segment, increased 12% during 1998 and also 
helped support revenue growth. VAN truck only revenue per loaded mile 
increased nearly 2% during 1998, while intermodal rates declined nearly 3%. 
The significant increase in the VAN driver to tractor ratio also helped 
improve tractor utilization to 2,645 miles per week in 1998 from 2,555 in 
1997. This approximate $225 million increase in VAN revenue and higher 
tractor utilization contributed to the significant increase in 1998 VAN 
operating income. VAN earnings were also favorably impacted in 1998 by lower 
fuel prices and lower insurance and claims costs.

     The 25% increase in the JBHL segment revenue during 1998 was due to new 
logistics agreements with new customers and growth of business levels with 
existing customers. The increase in 1998 JBHL operating income was primarily 
related to the higher revenue levels, as JBHL margins remained relatively 
constant. DCS segment revenue increased 41% to $211.9 million in 1998 from 
$150.7 million in 1997. This increase in DCS revenue was driven by both new 
customer contracts and additional projects or fleet additions to existing 
contracts. The higher level of DCS operating income during 1998 was primarily 
due to the growth of segment revenue and cost reduction actions in certain 
projects. Lower fuel costs also contributed to higher operating income in the
DCS segment. Other revenue in 1997 included the flatbed business which was 
sold in 1997.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     1998 COMPARED WITH 1997




     The following table sets forth items in the Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or 
decrease of those items as compared with the prior year.



OPERATING EXPENSES
     Total operating expenses in 1998 increased 15% over 1997, while total 
operating revenues increased nearly 19% during the same period. Operating 
expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues (operating ratio) 
were 94.4% in 1998, compared with 97.2% in 1997. Salaries, wages and employee 
benefits increased 20% during 1998 and rose to 34.9% of revenue in 1998 from 
34.4% in 1997. This increase was primarily due to an increase in driver wages 
as a percentage of revenue, driven by the mix change of more experienced, 
higher paid drivers, partly offset by lower worker's compensation claims 
costs. The increase in purchased transportation expense was related to the 
growth of intermodal and JBHL business, which results in higher payments to 
railroads and third-party motor carriers for purchased transportation 
services. Significantly lower fuel costs per gallon and slightly higher fuel 
miles per gallon performance helped drive fuel and fuel tax expense down in 
1998.

     Depreciation expense increased approximately 4% during 1998, but 
declined to 7.4% of revenue in 1998 from 8.4% in 1997. The amount of revenue 
equipment depreciation expense increased in relative proportion to the size 
of the fleet. However, depreciation was reduced by gains on the sale of 
certain assets. Gains on asset dispositions reduce depreciation expense and 
totaled $4.1 million in 1998, compared with $.7 million in 1997. Gains were 
recognized during 1998 on the sale of land in Lowell, Arkansas, a small 
subsidiary company and certain tractors and trailing equipment. Operating 
supplies and expenses include maintenance on revenue equipment and tires and 
increased in relative proportion to the fleet size. The decline in operating 
supplies and expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the 
growth of non-asset based revenue.

     The significant decrease in insurance and claims expense was the result 
of fewer vehicle collisions during 1998 and a decline in the cost per 
collision. The Company was successful in attracting and retaining experienced 
professional drivers that have been involved in fewer vehicle collisions and 
reduced accident costs. The decline in operating taxes and licenses was due, 
in part, to refunds received from certain state taxing authorities. The 
increase in general and administrative expenses was partly due to higher 
levels of spending for computer rental and maintenance. This spending was 
related to the decision to lease rather than purchase certain computer 
equipment and also for Year 2000 compliance work. Communications and 
utilities increased in relative proportion to revenue growth. Interest 
expense increased 17%, primarily due to higher debt levels. The effective 
income tax rate was 37% in 1998 and 38% in 1997.

     As a result of the above, net earnings for 1998 increased to $46.8 
million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.28, compared with $11.4 million 
in 1997, or $.31 per diluted share. A decrease in the number of weighted 
average shares outstanding (before the effect of dilutive stock options), was 
primarily due to the Company's acquisition of treasury shares. An increase in 
weighted average shares assuming dilution resulted from the increased effect 
of dilutive stock options caused by the increase in the Company's average 
market price of common stock during 1998.



SUMMARY OF 1997
     J.B. Hunt's 1997 financial and operating results reflect some 
significant management actions which were implemented during 1997 and late 
1996. In early 1996, a decision was made to concentrate Company resources on 
the three operating segments of VAN, JBHL and DCS. Assets and businesses 
which did not relate to these segments were sold. Businesses which 
transported small parcels and specialized in hazardous commodities were sold 
during 1996 and a flatbed operation was sold in 1997. In September of 1996, a 
new VAN over-the-road driver compensation package was announced, which became 
effective in February of 1997. This new pay and benefit package, which 
increased annual pay by approximately 33% for certain VAN drivers, was 
successful in attracting and retaining experienced and professional drivers. 
Driver turnover in the VAN business declined to 45% in 1997 from 86% in 1996. 
The increased cost of the new pay and benefit package was partly offset, as 
anticipated, by closing the two company-owned driver training schools, lower 
driver recruiting expense, reduced vehicle collisions and higher tractor 
utilization. The ability to add drivers and a strong demand for 
transportation services during late 1997 combined to produce revenue growth 
during the fourth quarter of 1997.

     Consolidated operating revenues increased 4.5% in 1997, to $1,554.3 
million from $1,486.7 million in 1996. Operating revenue in the VAN segment 
increased 7%, to $1,153.5 million in 1997 from $1,082.8 million in 1996. This 
increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in the size of the tractor fleet, 
offset by approximately 2% reductions in both truck only and intermodal 
rates. JBHL revenues increased 46% to $254.1 million in 1997 from $173.6 
million in 1996. This increase in JBHL revenue was primarily due to new 
business and contracts executed with significant "Fortune 500" customers. DCS 
revenue increased 19%, to $150.7 million in 1997 from $126.9 million in 1996. 
This increase in DCS revenue was driven by both new customer contracts and 
additional projects or fleet additions to existing contracts. The DCS tractor 
count increased by 18% in 1997. Other revenue in 1997 and 1996 included the 
parcel management and special commodities operations which were sold in 1996 
and a flatbed division which was sold in 1997.

1997 COMPARED WITH 1996





     The following table sets forth items in the Consolidated Statements of 
Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or 
decrease of those items as compared with the prior year.



OPERATING EXPENSES
     Total operating expenses in 1997 increased 6% over 1996, while operating 
revenues increased 4.5% over the same period. Operating expenses expressed as 
a percentage of operating revenues (operating ratio) were 97.2% in 1997, 
compared with 95.9% in 1996. The increase in salaries, wages and employee 
benefits was primarily due to the new driver compensation package, which was 
effective in February of 1997. The significant increase in purchased 
transportation was consistent with trends in recent years and reflects 
payments to railroads and other third-party companies that provided 
transportation services to the Company. Fuel and fuel taxes expense declined, 
primarily due to lower fuel cost per gallon and improved miles per gallon 
performance.

     The increase in operating supplies and expenses was primarily due to 
higher trailing equipment lease and rental costs. The decline in insurance 
and claims expense was a result of lower collision frequency, primarily 
related to a decision to limit the speed of the tractor fleet to 59 miles per 
hour and the more experienced driver force attracted by the new compensation 
package. A related reduction in general and administrative expenses was 
primarily due to reduced driver recruiting and training costs. Reduced 
insurance related costs and lower driver hiring expenses were two primary 
sources for funding the new driver compensation program.

     As a result of the above, net earnings for 1997 declined to $11.4 
million, or diluted earnings per share of $.31, from $22.1 million, or $.58 
per diluted share in 1996. A decrease in the number of weighted average 
shares outstanding (before the effect of dilutive stock options), was 
primarily due to the Company's acquisition of treasury shares.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company generates significant amounts of cash from operating
activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $183 million in 1998,
$161 million in 1997 and $141 million in 1996. During the three year period
ended December 31, 1998, primary operating cash requirements were applied to
increases in accounts receivable, other current assets (inventories, licenses
and permits) and to pay claims. Primary sources of cash included net earnings,
depreciation, trade accounts payable and deferred income taxes.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $261 million in 1998, $90 
million in 1997 and $131 million in 1996. The primary use of funds for 
investing activities was the acquisition of new revenue equipment. New 
tractor purchases were approximately 2,900 in 1998, 2,400 in 1997 and 2,000 
in 1996. The level of investment spending for trailing equipment varied 
significantly during the three year period ended December 31, 1998. The total 
number of trailing pieces of equipment purchased was approximately 4,700 in 
1998, 490 in 1997 and 1,900 in 1996. The Company leased trailing equipment in 
1998 and 1997 to supplement its owned fleet.



     Financing activities generated $83 million in 1998 and consumed $71 
million in 1997 and $10 million in 1996. The Company sold $100 million of 
7.00% senior notes in September of 1998, which will mature in September of 
2004. Financing activities also included the purchase of treasury stock 
totaling $5.8 million in 1998, $22.0 million in 1997 and $17.8 million in 
1996. Funds were also used for repayments of debt and to pay dividends.


     The Company is authorized to issue up to $240 million in notes under a 
commercial paper note program, of which $131 million was outstanding at 
December 31, 1998. In addition, the Company has approximately $95 million of 
uncommitted lines of credit, none of which were outstanding at December 31, 
1998.

     From time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of 
Company common stock. Purchases of Company stock were:



     At December 31, 1998, the Company had committed to purchase 
approximately $110 million of revenue and service equipment net of expected 
proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances. Additional capital spending for 
new revenue equipment is anticipated during 1999, however, funding for such 
expenditures is expected to come from cash generated from operations and 
existing borrowing facilities.

YEAR 2000

     The Company utilizes and is dependent upon a wide variety of complex 
information technologies (IT) to conduct daily business operations. Some of 
the Company's older computer software programs and equipment use two digit 
fields rather than four digit fields to define the applicable year. As a 
result, some of the time or date-sensitive functions of these programs and 
equipment could result in equipment shutdowns, miscalculations, inability to 
process data and/or disruption of operations as the Year 2000 approaches. It 
is possible that some problems may develop during 1999 (e.g. applications 
that utilize future or projected data), well before January 1, 2000.

     The Company recognized the importance of Year 2000 issues and developed 
an action plan in 1996. The plan includes systematic reviews of all internal 
hardware, software and functions to either verify that the system is Year 
2000 compliant or modify/replace the software or system as required. The 
process includes the use of a software testing tool which simulates the 
transition to the Year 2000. The original plan contemplated all conversion 
efforts to be completed by the end of 1998. As of December 31, 1998, the 
majority of application programs (i.e. software that interacts with users 
through computer terminals and produces reports) had been modified or 
replaced. These programs have been unit tested by IT staff members, but still 
require detail testing by users and Year 2000 simulation. A number of the 
primary financial systems utilized to pay vendors, track customer accounts 
receivable and produce regular financial reports have been converted or are 
in the final stages of conversion to be Year 2000 compliant. The additional 
modifications, installations and unit testing of the Company's internal 
computer and IT applications are currently expected to be completed by July 
1, 1999.

     In addition to the issues and risks associated with the Company's 
internal IT systems and equipment, the Company has relationships and is 
dependent upon a number of third parties that include customers and suppliers 
of goods and services. Daily business operations include the electronic data 
interchange of information (EDI) with customers and providers of 
transportation services such as railroads and motor freight carriers. Other 
third party providers of critical services such as voice and data 
communications, natural gas and electricity, and diesel fuel are also an 
integral part of daily business operations. If significant numbers or certain 
critical customers or suppliers




experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to Year 2000 
non-compliance, it could adversely affect the Company's normal business 
activities. While some of these risks are not controllable by the Company, a 
number of actions and procedures have been implemented to assess and/or 
reduce this risk. Formal communications have been initiated with certain 
significant customers and suppliers. Depending upon the circumstances, formal 
certifications of Year 2000 compliance have been requested and received. The 
Company has not received enough formal responses to date to make an accurate 
assessment of the Year 2000 readiness of its primary customers and suppliers.

     Since 1996, the Company has spent approximately $1.3 million on Year 
2000 compliance. Estimated future expense to complete testing and related 
compliance work is $200,000 for a total cost of $1.5 million. These costs are 
being charged to operations as incurred. This cost estimate excludes certain 
new system acquisitions, development and implementation expenses that relate 
to on-going business activity, normal upgrades and enhancements. The Company 
has also spent approximately $4.4 million of acquisition and implementation 
costs for primary financial systems upgrades. These costs are being 
capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
since these new systems were acquired for business reasons and not to 
remediate Year 2000 problems, if any, in the former systems. Current 
estimated future costs for such financial systems upgrades are $3.0 million.

     The Company presently believes that its internal computer systems and 
equipment will not pose significant operational problems relative to the Year 
2000 issue. There can be no assurance that the Company will properly identify 
all Year 2000 issues or that certain external customers or suppliers will not 
experience disruption of IT functions or actual services provided. Even 
short-term disruption of telecommunications service, for example, could have 
a material adverse impact on the Company's business. In order to reduce the 
risks associated with the Year 2000 problem, the Company is developing a 
contingency plan which is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999.

RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS
     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial 
instruments and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires an entity to 
measure all derivatives at fair value and to recognize them in the balance 
sheet as an asset or liability, depending on the entity's rights or 
obligations under the applicable derivative contract. The recognition of 
changes in fair value of a derivative that affect the income statement will 
depend on the intended use of the derivative. If the derivative does not 
qualify as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss on the derivative will be 
recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies for special 
hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the derivative will either (1) be 
recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the 
item being hedged or (2) be deferred in other comprehensive income and 
reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the 
hedged transaction affects earnings. SFAS 133 will be effective for the 
Company no later than the quarter ending March 31, 2000, SFAS 133 may not be 
applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods. The Company 
has not determined the impact that Statement 133 will have on its financial 
statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until 
closer to the date of initial adoption.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
     This report contains statements that may be considered as 
forward-looking or predictions concerning future operations. Such statements 
are based on management's belief or interpretation of information currently 
available. These statements and assumptions involve certain risks and 
uncertainties and management can give no assurance that such expectations 
will be realized. Among all the factors and events that are not within the 
Company's control and could have a material impact on future operating 
results are general economic conditions, cost and availability of diesel 
fuel, adverse weather conditions and competitive rate fluctuations. Future 
financial and operating results of the Company may fluctuate as a result of 
these and other risk factors as detailed from time to time in Company filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



ITEM 7a.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company's earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest 
rates as a result of its issuance of short-term commercial paper. However, 
due to its selective utilization of interest rate swaps, the effects of 
interest rate changes are mitigated. Risk can be estimated by measuring the 
impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in short-term market interest 
rates. If short-term market interest rates average 10% more in 1999 than in 
1998, there would be no material adverse impact on the Company's results of 
operations. At December 31, 1998, the Company's interest rate swap agreements 
had a fair value of $1.6 million (net liability position). The Company has no 
material future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates 
related to its long-term debt obligations as all of the Company's long-term 
debt obligations have fixed rates. At December 31, 1998, the fair value of 
the Company's fixed rate long-term obligations approximated carrying value.

     Although the Company conducts business in foreign countries, 
international operations are not material to the Company's consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, 
foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material to the 
Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998. 
Accordingly, the Company is not currently subject to material foreign 
currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of 
foreign currencies would have on the Company's future costs or on future cash 
flows it would receive from it's foreign investment. To date, the Company has 
not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other 
derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations 
in foreign currency exchange rates.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


(1)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       (a)    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

              J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned
              subsidiaries ("Company"), is a diversified transportation services
              and logistics company operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
              Department of Transportation and various state regulatory
              agencies.

              The Company presently has three distinct operating segments:
              Van/Intermodal: Logistics; and Dedicated Contract Services.

       (b)    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

              The consolidated financial statements include the financial
              statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
              significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
              eliminated in consolidation.

       (c)    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

              For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company
              considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
              maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

       (d)    TIRES IN SERVICE

              The Company capitalizes tires placed in service on new revenue
              equipment as a part of the equipment cost. Replacement tires and
              costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are
              placed in service.

       (e)    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

              Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the
              straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 - 10
              years for revenue and service equipment, 10 to 40 years for
              structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and
              office equipment. Gains on dispositions of revenue and other
              equipment, which are included in depreciation expense, were
              approximately $4,051,000, $664,000 and $7,949,000 for the years
              ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

       (f)    REVENUE RECOGNITION

              The Company recognizes revenue based on relative transit time in
              each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.


                                       24                           (Continued)


                       J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996



       (g)    INCOME TAXES

              Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
              method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
              future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
              financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
              liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
              tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
              measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
              income in the years in which those temporary differences are
              expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
              assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
              income in the period that includes the enactment date.

       (h)    EARNINGS PER SHARE

              A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and
              diluted earnings per share is shown below:



                                       25                           (Continued)


                       J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


              Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding
              during each year but were not included in the computation of
              diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price was
              greater than the average market price of the common shares are
              shown in the table below.



       (i)    CREDIT RISK

              Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
              concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade
              receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
              receivables are limited due to the Company's large number of
              customers and the diverse range of industries which they
              represent. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had no
              significant concentrations of credit risk.

       (j)    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

              The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the effects of
              fluctuations in interest rates. The differential paid or received
              on interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates
              change and is charged or credited to interest expense over the
              life of the agreements. Any gains or losses realized upon the
              termination of an interest rate swap agreement are deferred and
              amortized over the remaining life of the original term as a charge
              or credit to interest expense.

       (k)    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

              Local currencies are generally considered the functional
              currencies outside the United States. Assets and liabilities are
              translated at year-end exchange rates for operations in local
              currency environments. Income and expense items are translated at
              average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

              Prior to January 1, 1997, foreign currency translation
              adjustments, which reflect foreign currency exchange rate changes
              applicable to the net assets of the Mexican operations have been
              recorded as a separate item of accumulated other comprehensive
              loss in stockholders' equity. As of January 1, 1997, Mexico is
              considered a highly inflationary economy as defined by Statement
              of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, FOREIGN
              CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Accordingly, the more stable currency of the
              reporting parent (the Company) has been used, and the effect of
              exchange rates resulting in translation adjustments have been
              recorded as a component of net earnings for the years ended
              December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Management of the
              Company expects foreign currency translation adjustments in 1999
              to be included as accumulated other comprehensive loss.


                                       26                           (Continued)

                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


       (l)    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

              The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
              123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION and, as permitted
              under SFAS No. 123, applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
              No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for compensation
              costs for its stock option plans. Accordingly, compensation
              expense is recognized on the date of grant only if the current
              market price of the underlying common stock at date of grant
              exceeds the exercise price.

       (m)    IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE 
              DISPOSED OF

              The Company continually evaluates the carrying value of its assets
              for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the
              carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
              be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
              amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
              generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
              impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
              amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair
              value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
              lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

       (n)    USE OF ESTIMATES

              Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
              assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities
              and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare
              the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
              accepted accounting principles.  Actual results could differ from
              those estimates.

       (o)    COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

              On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, REPORTING
              COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
              reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its
              components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive
              income consists of net earnings and foreign currency translation
              adjustments and is presented in the consolidated statements of
              stockholders' equity. The Statement requires only additional
              disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; it does not
              affect the Company's financial position or results of operations.
              Prior year consolidated financial statements have been
              reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS No. 130.
              During 1998 and 1997, comprehensive income and net earnings were
              the same (see note 1k).

(2)    LONG-TERM DEBT

       Long-term debt consists of (in thousands):



       Under its commercial paper note program, the Company is authorized to
       issue up to $240 million in notes. These notes are supported by two
       credit agreements, which aggregate $240 million, with a group of banks,
       of which $120 million expires March 12, 1999 and $120 million expires
       March 20, 2002. The effective rate on the commercial note program was
       5.70% and 5.69% for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997,
       respectively. The 7.84% senior notes are payable in annual installments
       of $5,000,000 on March 31 and the 7.80% senior subordinated notes are
       payable in five equal annual installments beginning October 30, 2000.

       Under the terms of the credit agreements and the note agreements, the
       Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants including
       leverage tests, minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial
       ratios. The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants
       at December 31, 1998.


                                       28                           (Continued)

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                      DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996



       The Company has approximately $95 million of uncommitted lines of credit,
       none of which were outstanding at December 31, 1998. These lines are with
       various domestic and international banks and are due on demand. Interest
       on borrowings is generally tied to the banks' prevailing base rates or
       other alternative market rates. No commitment or facility fees are paid
       on these lines of credit and the obligations are typically evidenced by
       unsecured demand notes.

       Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1998 consist of
       outstanding commercial paper associated with the revolving credit
       agreement which expires March 12, 1999 and the remaining installment of
       the 7.84% senior notes. The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt
       for each of the five years ending December 31 are as follows (in
       thousands): 1999, $16,350; 2000, $60,000; 2001, $10,000; 2002, $130,000;
       and 2003, $108,260.

(3)    CAPITAL STOCK

       The Company maintains a Management Incentive Plan ("Plan") that provides
       various vehicles to compensate key employees with Company common stock.
       Under the original Plan, the Company was authorized to award, in
       aggregate, not more than 5,000,000 shares. During 1998, the stockholders
       of the Company amended the Plan whereby the Company is now authorized to
       award, in aggregate, not more than 6,500,000 shares. At December 31, 1998
       there were approximately 1,019,000 shares available for grant under the
       Plan. The Company has utilized three such vehicles to award stock or
       grant options to purchase the Company's common stock: restricted stock
       awards, restricted options and nonstatutory stock options.

       Restricted stock awards are granted to key employees subject to
       restrictions regarding transferability and assignment. Shares of Company
       common stock are issued to the key employees and held by the Company
       until each employee becomes vested in the award. Vesting of the awards
       generally occurs over a four year period of time from the award date.
       Termination of the employee for any reason other than death, disability
       or certain cases of retirement causes the unvested portion of the award
       to be forfeited.

       Prior to 1994, key employees were granted restricted options to purchase
       stock. Vesting of the award generally occurred over a four year period
       beginning on the grant date. Failure to exercise a vested option within
       210 days after vesting or termination of the employee for any reason
       other than death or disability resulted in forfeiture.

       The Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key
       employees for the purchase of Company common stock for 100% of the fair
       market value of the common stock at the grant date. The options generally
       vest over a ten year period and are forfeited if the employee terminates
       for any reason.

       Compensation expense (benefit) under the Plan is charged to earnings over
       the vesting period and amounted to approximately $20,000, $(78,000) and
       $628,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
       respectively.

                                       29                           (Continued)



                       J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


       A summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase Company
       common stock follows:



       During 1995, the Board of Directors established a nonqualified stock
       option plan to provide performance based compensation to the Chairman of
       the Board. The plan allows the Chairman the option to purchase up to 2.5
       million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $17.63 per
       share. These options vest after five years, except for special
       circumstances in which the options vest earlier. The options must be
       exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised options will
       terminate.

       Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at
       the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's
       net earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
       below.




                                       30                           (Continued)


                       J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996



       Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted since December 31,
       1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation costs for
       stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net
       earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is reflected
       over the options' vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation cost
       for options granted prior to January 1, 1996 is not considered.

       The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during
       1998, 1997 and 1996 was $13.23, $6.86 and $7.88, respectively, on the
       date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the
       following weighted-average assumptions: 1998 - expected dividend yield
       .9%, volatility of 65.5%, risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, and an
       expected life of 7.7 years; 1997 - expected dividend yield 1.1%,
       volatility of 34.1%, risk-free interest rate of 5.8%, and an expected
       life of 7.7 years; 1996 - expected dividend yield 1.4%, volatility of
       34.8%, risk-free interest rate of 6.2%, and an expected life of 5.6
       years.

       The following table summarizes information about stock options
       outstanding at December 31, 1998:



       On January 28, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash
       dividend of $.05 per share payable on February 24, 1999 to shareholders
       of record on February 10, 1999.

(4)    INCOME TAXES

       Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and
       1996 was allocated as follows (in thousands):




                                       31                           (Continued)

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


       Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings before income taxes
       consists of (in thousands):



       The following is a reconciliation between the effective income tax rate
       and the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate for each of the
       three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 1998:



       The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
       portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at
       December 31, 1998 and 1997 are presented below (in thousands):





                                       32                           (Continued)


                         J.B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                  AND SUBSIDIARIES

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                          DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996



       The Company believes its history of profitability and taxable income and
       its utilization of tax planning sufficiently supports the carrying amount
       of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a
       valuation allowance as all deferred tax benefits are more likely than not
       to be realized.

       At December 31, 1998, the Company had general business tax credit
       carryforwards of approximately $2,621,000 expiring from the year 2007 to
       2009, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with no expiration
       of approximately $4,700,000.

(5)    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

       The Company maintains a defined contribution employee retirement plan,
       which includes a 401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to
       participate. The Company matches a specified percentage of employee
       contributions, subject to certain limitations. For the years ended
       December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, total Company contributions to the
       plan, including matching 401(k) contributions, were $6,533,000,
       $4,951,000 and $3,450,000, respectively.

(6)    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE ACCOUNTS 
       PAYABLE

       The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
       of these instruments.

       LONG-TERM DEBT

       The carrying amount of the commercial paper debt approximates the fair
       value because of the short maturity of the commercial paper instruments.

       The fair value of the fixed rate debt is presented as the present value
       of future cash flows discounted using the Company's current borrowing
       rate for notes of comparable maturity. The calculation arrives at a
       theoretical amount the Company would pay a creditworthy third party to
       assume its fixed rate obligations and not the termination value of these
       obligations. Consistent with market practices, such termination values
       may include various prepayment and termination fees that the Company
       would contractually be required to pay if it retired the debt early.

                                       33                           (Continued)

                        DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996



       INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

       The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are obtained from dealer
       quotes. These values represent the estimated amount the Company would pay
       to terminate such agreements, taking into consideration current interest
       rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.

       The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are
       summarized as follows (in thousands):



           (a)   The fair value for these assets either approximated carrying
                 value because of the nature of these instruments, or was
                 impracticable to determine.

(7)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       The Company advances premiums on life insurance policies on the lives of
       the Company's principal stockholder and his wife. All premiums paid by
       the Company, along with accrued interest thereon, are reimbursable from a
       trust which is the owner and beneficiary of the policy. The Company has a
       guarantee from the stockholder for the amount of premiums paid by the
       Company together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum. The amounts
       reimbursable to the Company amount to approximately $6,068,000 and
       $5,408,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. These amounts are
       included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

  (8)  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

       The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising
       from the normal conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of
       the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management
       believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a
       material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
       operations of the Company.

(9)    SEGMENT INFORMATION

       Van/Intermodal services include full truck-load, dry-van,
       container-sizable freight which is typically transported utilizing
       company-owned revenue equipment. The load may be transported entirely by
       company-owned and controlled equipment or a portion of the movement may
       be handled by a third-party motor carrier or a railroad. Logistics
       provides a wide range of comprehensive transportation and management
       services including experienced professional managers, information and
       optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of system
       solutions. Logistics may utilize van/intermodal and/or dedicated contract
       owned and controlled equipment, unrelated third-party equipment and
       employees, or a combination to meet the customer's service requirements.
       Dedicated Contract Services typically include company-owned revenue
       equipment and employee drivers that are assigned to a specific customer,
       traffic lane or service. The dedicated service is engineered and
       customized for the specific customer and is typically in accordance with
       a written, long-term agreement. Substantially all of the Company's
       revenues are from domestic customers. Intersegment revenues primarily
       consist of van/intermodal services provided to logistics. Such services
       are priced at approximately the same basis as services to external
       customers. Certain administrative and other costs are allocated among the
       segments utilizing various allocation factors which include revenues,
       equipment usage and maintenance, accounts receivable and other estimates.
       Substantially all of the Company's capital expenditures are made by the
       van/intermodal division with assets transferred to the dedicated contract
       division as needed. A summary of other segment information is presented
       below (in millions):
