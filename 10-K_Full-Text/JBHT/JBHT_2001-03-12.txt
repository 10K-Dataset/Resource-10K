PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

GENERAL
     J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned
subsidiaries ("JBHT" or the "Company"), is a diversified transportation
services company operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) and various state regulatory agencies. JBHT is an
Arkansas holding company incorporated on August 10, 1961. Through its
subsidiaries and associated companies, JBHT provides a wide range of
logistics and transportation services to a diverse group of customers. The
Company directly manages or provides tailored, technology-driven solutions to
a growing list of Fortune 500 companies. These customers may request
specifically targeted transportation service or outsource their entire
transportation function to JBHT, or an associated company. The Company also
directly transports full-load containerizable freight throughout the
continental United States and portions of Canada and Mexico. Transportation
services may utilize JBHT equipment and employees, or may employ equipment
and services provided by associated or unrelated third parties in the
transportation industry. The Company currently operates four distinct
operating segments: dry-van truck only ("JBT"), intermodal ("JBI"), dedicated
contract services ("DCS") and logistics business segments. Effective July 1,
2000, the Company, along with five other large, publicly-held transportation
companies, contributed its logistics business to a new, commonly owned
company, Transplace.com, LLC.

JBT
     Primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment
include full truck-load, dry-van, freight which is typically transported
utilizing company-owned revenue equipment. Freight is picked up at the dock
or specified location of the shipper and transported directly to the location
of the consignee. The load may be transported entirely by company-owned and
controlled power equipment or a portion of the movement may be handled by a
third-party motor carrier. Typically, the charges for the entire movement are
billed to the customer by the Company and the Company, in turn, pays the
third-party for their portion of the transportation services provided. JBT
operates utilizing certain Canadian authorities which were initially granted
in 1988 and may transport freight to and from all points in the continental
United States to Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. The Company has
authorization to operate directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date
has served limited points in Canada, primarily through interchange operations
with Canadian motor carriers. The Company operated its JBT and JBI segments
in combined fashion in periods prior to January 1, 2000. This combined
operation was reported as Van/Intermodal ("Van") in prior periods. At
December 31, 2000, the JBT segment operated approximately 5,850 tractors,
18,120 trailers and employed 8,462 people, 6,789 of which were drivers. JBT
gross revenue was $834 million in 2000, an increase of 9% over 1999.

JBI
     Transportation service offerings of the JBI segment utilize agreements
with various railroads to provide proven intermodal freight solutions to JBI
customers in all major lanes of commerce in the United States, Canada, and
Mexico. The Company differentiates itself from others through its premium
service network, as well as, coordinated door to door service on
company-owned and controlled assets. The Company established its first
intermodal agreement with the Santa Fe Railway in 1989. Through growth of
this transportation segment and additions, deletions, and mergers of rail
carriers, the Company now has agreements with seven North American rail
carriers: BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX, Kansas City Southern, Union Pacific,
Canadian National, and Florida East Coast railroads. Typically, freight is
picked up at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transported to
the rail carrier for loading on to rail cars. Upon completion of the rail
routing, the freight is picked up at the rail carrier's ramp and transported
to the consignee. These originating and destination drays may be transported
entirely by company-owned and controlled power equipment or may be handled by
a third-party motor carrier. It is the Company's customary business practice
that all charges for the entire movement are billed to the customer by the
Company and the Company, in turn, pays the rail carrier and third-party motor
carrier for their portion of the transportation services provided. In 1993,
rail operations were expanded to utilize high-cube containers which can be
separated from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars to provide
improved productivity. This concept is know as container-on-flatcar (COFC).
The agreements the Company has with its rail carriers allow for the majority
of JBI business carried under these rail agreements to receive priority space
on trains and preferential loading and unloading at rail facilities. At
December 31, 2000, the JBI segment operated approximately 910 tractors,
21,930 containers and employed 1,705 people, 1,410 of which were drivers. JBI
gross revenue was $681 million in 2000, an increase of 5% over 1999.







DCS
     Since 1992, JBHT has offered dedicated contract carriage as a service
option. DCS segment operations specialize in the design, development, and
execution of supply chain solutions. Capitalizing on advanced systems and
technologies, DCS offers engineered transportation solutions that support
private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation, and transportation system
augmentation. DCS operations typically provide customized services that are
governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry van, flatbed, and
temperature-controlled operations. Near 100% on-time service is standard with
efficient routes executed to design specifications.

     DCS operations focus on driving out cost and enhancing customer value
through leveraging the JBHT freight network for backhaul infusion. Network
freight may be used to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles, thereby
reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost. DCS also frequently finds
synergy in shared resources with the JBT and JBI segments including terminals,
maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations, and trailer pools providing further
economies of scale. In the year 2000, DCS reported gross revenues of $479
million, a 49% increase over 1999 and a 50% compound annual growth rate since
1998. Increased utilization and productivity drove top-line revenue growth as
the number of tractors increased 43% to 3,890 in 2000. Total DCS employees were
4,746 at December 31, 2000, 4,083 of which were drivers.

LOGISTICS
     The Company formally began offering logistics transportation services in
1992 through a wholly-owned subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics (JBL). JBL services
frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a
substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation process to one
organization. The JBL segment business included a wide range of comprehensive
transportation and management services including experienced professional
managers, information and optimization technology, and the actual design or
redesign of system solutions. A new JBL customer or service arrangement may have
required a significant amount of up-front analysis and design time, while
alternatives were considered and custom systems and software were developed.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company contributed substantially all of its JBL
segment business, all related intangible assets and $5 million of cash to a
newly-formed, commonly-owned company, Transplace.com, LLC ("TPC").

     TPC is an Internet-based global transportation logistics company. The
initial members include the Company, along with five other large, publicly-held
transportation companies: Covenant Transport, Inc.; M.S. Carriers, Inc.; Swift
Transportation Co., Inc.; U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc., and Werner Enterprises,
Inc. The Company presently has an approximate 27% membership interest in TPC
and, accordingly, utilizes the equity method of accounting. The financial
results of TPC since inception, are included on a one-line, non-operating item
included on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled "equity in earnings
of associated companies." Equity in earnings from TPC totaled $440,000 in 2000.

ASSOCIATED COMPANY - MEXICO
     The Company has provided transportation services to and from Mexico since
1989. These services frequently involve equipment interchange operations with
various Mexican motor carriers. A joint venture agreement with Transportacion
Maritima Mexicana, one of the largest transportation companies in Mexico, was
signed in 1992. The joint venture, Comercializadora Internacional de Carga, St.
de CV and its subsidiaries, originate and complete northbound and southbound
international truck movements between the U.S. and Mexico. The joint venture
also provides Mexican domestic irregular route truck service, refrigerated
freight services, Mexican dedicated contract business and short-haul drayage to
and from the Mexican maritime ports and rail heads. The Company's share of its
Mexican joint venture operating results are included on a one-line,
non-operating item on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled "equity
in earnings of associated companies." Equity in earnings from the Company's
Mexican joint venture totaled $4.3 million in 2000 and $3.1 million in 1999.

OTHER
     The Company announced a decision in late 1999, to separate the operation of
the Van business into truck (JBT) and intermodal (JBI) segments. In late 2000, a
decision was made to supplement Company owned tractors with independent
contractors (I/C's). An I/C is a driver who personally owns one or more tractors
and agrees to lease that equipment to the Company. These arrangements typically
call for the I/C to transport freight offered by the Company utilizing a tractor
owned by the I/C, in trailers owned or controlled by the Company. This new
program was initiated by the JBT segment in December of 2000. At December 31,
2000, 16 I/C's were leasing tractors to the Company.









MARKETING AND OPERATIONS
     JBHT transports a wide range of products including automotive parts,
department store merchandise, paper and wood products, food and beverages,
plastics, chemicals and manufacturing materials and supplies. The Company's
primary customers include many of the "Fortune 500" companies, but no single
customer accounted for more than 12% of revenues during 2000. A broad geographic
dispersion and a good balance in the type of freight transported allows JBHT
some protection from major seasonal fluctuations. However, consistent with the
truckload industry in general, freight is typically stronger during the second
half of the year, with peak volume occurring in August through mid November.
Revenue and earnings are also affected by bad weather, holidays, fuel prices and
railroad service levels.

     The Company generally markets all of its service offerings through a
nationwide marketing network. All transportation services offered are typically
billed directly to the customer by JBHT and all inquiries, claims and other
customer contacts are handled by the Company. Certain marketing, sales,
engineering and design functions are assigned to each operating segment.
However, marketing strategy, pricing and national account service coordination
is managed at the corporate level.

PERSONNEL
     At December 31, 2000, JBHT employed approximately 15,980 people, including
12,280 drivers. Historically the truckload transportation industry and the
Company have experienced shortages of qualified drivers. In addition, driver
turnover rates for truckload motor carriers frequently exceed 100%. In September
of 1996, JBHT announced a new compensation program for the approximate 3,500
over-the-road JBT drivers. This comprehensive package, which was effective in
February of 1997, included an average 33% increase in wages for this group of
employees. This program was designed to attract and retain a professional and
experienced work force capable of delivering a high level of customer service.
As anticipated, this increase in driver wages and benefits was partially offset
by lower driver recruiting and training expense, reduced accident costs and
better equipment utilization. The average driver turnover in the JBT segment
business was approximately 66% during 2000. Drivers are typically compensated on
a rate-per-mile basis, a rate-per-week basis or a combination of factors. JBHT
also employed approximately 2,970 office personnel and 730 mechanics at December
31, 2000. No employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements and
management believes that its relationship with its employees is excellent.

REVENUE EQUIPMENT
         At December 31, 2000, JBHT owned or leased approximately 10,650
tractors and operated 22,380 trailers and 21,930 containers. JBHT believes that
modern, late-model, clean equipment differentiates quality customer service,
increases equipment utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime. The
Company generally operates with newer revenue equipment in the JBT segment, with
the age of tractors and trailers approximating two years and four years,
respectively, at December 31, 2000. Slightly older equipment and tractors
designed for local and regional operations are typically utilized in the JBI
segment. Specially designed high-cube containers which can be separated from the
chassis and double-stacked on rail cars are also operated by JBI. The average
age of JBI tractors and containers at December 31, 2000 was approximately three
years and five years, respectively. The composition of the dedicated contract
fleet varies with specific customer service requirements. All JBHT revenue
equipment is maintained in accordance with a specific maintenance program
primarily based on age and miles traveled.

COMPETITION
     JBHT is one of the largest publicly held truckload carriers in the United
States. It competes primarily with other irregular route, truckload common
carriers. Less-than-truckload common carriers and private carriers generally
provide limited competition for truckload carriers. JBHT and its associated
companies are one of a few carriers offering nationwide logistics management and
dedicated revenue equipment services. Although a number of carriers may provide
competition on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent
competition in all markets. The extensive rail network developed in conjunction
with the various railroads also allows the Company the opportunity to
differentiate its services in the marketplace.




REGULATION
     The Company's operations as a for-hire carrier are subject to regulation by
the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration (FMCSA) and by various Canadian provinces. Entry controlled
barriers have largely been removed as a result of federal deregulation statutes
such as the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA). The
FMCSA continues to enforce safety regulations and has proposed new rules which,
if approved in their present form, would limit driver's hours of service.
President Bush is considering implementation of provisions of the North America
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which may result in increased competition between
U.S. and Mexican carriers for truckload services moving between these two
countries. The Company believes it has responded effectively to the marketplace
changes caused by increased domestic competition and that it can effectively
respond to any foreseeable changes in FMCSA regulations or NAFTA implementation.


ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

     The Company's corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. A
150,000-square-foot building was constructed and occupied in September 1990. The
Company also utilizes its former corporate building as general offices. In 1999,
a new 20,000 square foot building was constructed and occupied near the
corporate headquarters. A portion of this leased facility serves as a backup
data center and provide disaster recovery support services. An additional 20,000
square foot building consisting of general office space for Corporate employees
was completed and occupied in 2000. This building is located next door to the
data center building and is a leased facility.

     Principal outside facilities consist primarily of general offices which
support operational, safety and maintenance functions. In addition to the
principal facilities listed below, the Company leases numerous small offices and
trailer parking yards in various locations throughout the county to support
customer trailing equipment pool commitments.

A summary of the Company's principal facilities follows:









ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising
from the normal conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of the facts
and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes the
resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)









ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and related footnotes
appearing in this annual report.


SUMMARY OF 2000

     Financial and operating results for the year 2000 were impacted by a
number of significant items. Consolidated operating revenues for 2000 increased
6% over 1999. Excluding the JBL operations, which were contributed to TPC as of
July 1, 2000, revenue growth for the remaining segments was approximately 15%.
The increase in fuel surcharge revenue associated with higher costs of fuel in
the current year accounted for approximately 4% of revenue growth for these
remaining segments. Prior to January 1, 2000, the JBT and JBI businesses had
been operated and reported together as the Van business segment. Accordingly,
2000 was the first full year that certain JBT and JBI identifiable information
was available.

     JBT segment revenue, which consists primarily of full truckload, dry-van
freight, increased 9%, to $833.8 million in 2000, from $763.2 million, in 1999.
Revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 3.4% in 2000. The
JBT company owned/leased tractor fleet totaled 5,850 at December 31, 2000. A
new initiative to utilize independent contractors, who own their tractors was
commenced in late 2000. In addition to its company owned tractors, the JBT
segment had operating arrangements with 16 independent contractors at December
31, 2000. The JBT segment incurred an operating loss of $7.1 million in 2000.
Since the JBT and JBI segments were operated in combined fashion during 1999,
no comparative operating results were available. A portion of the year 2000 JBT
operating loss was due to certain costs incurred to separate the JBT and JBI
business units.

     The JBI segment business, which includes primarily truckload freight
transported by rail and certain repositioning truck freight, grew 5%, to $681.1
million in 2000, from $651.6 million in 1999. Intermodal revenue per loaded
mile in 2000, exclusive of fuel surcharges, was essentially flat compared with
1999. The JBI tractor fleet totaled 910 at December 31, 2000. The intermodal
segment generated operating income of $36.7 million in 2000. A comparable
amount for 1999 is not available.

     DCS segment business primarily includes services provided with
company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers assigned to specific
customers or traffic lanes. During 2000, DCS segment revenue grew 49%, to
$478.6 million, from $320.2 million in 1999. A portion of the DCS segment
revenue growth was due to transfers of equipment and drivers from the JBT
business segment. The DCS tractor fleet totaled 3,890 at December 31, 2000. DCS
operating income was $28.4 million in 2000, compared with $24.1 million in
1999. The lower margin on the DCS segment business in 2000 was primarily due to
a higher proportionate share of corporate support costs being assigned to the
business.

     As previously mentioned, the JBL business was contributed to TPC effective
July 1, 2000. JBL generated $230 million of revenue and $8.1 million of
operating income between January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2000. The Company's share
of TPC's results of operations were reported in a one-line, non-operating item
on the consolidated statements of earnings and totaled $440,000 in 2000. No
gain or loss was recognized upon formation and contribution of JBL segment
assets to TPC.









RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     2000 COMPARED WITH 1999




*As of December 31, 2000, TPC qualifies as a reportable business segment for
financial reporting purposes. However, the logistics segment information shown
above excludes TPC from its inception in July 2000. TPC is accounted for on the
equity method.


The following table sets forth items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease
of those items as compared with the prior year.








OPERATING EXPENSES

     Total operating expenses in 2000 increased 6.4% over 1999, while total
operating revenues increased 5.6%. Operating expenses expressed as a percentage
of operating revenue (operating ratio) were 97.1% in 2000, compared with 96.4%
in 1999. These comparisons were impacted by the contribution of the JBL segment
business to TPC, effective July 1, 2000. Salaries, wages and employee benefits
increased 7.9% during 2000 and rose to 35.6% of revenue in 2000, from 34.9% in
1999. These increases were primarily due to increases in driver compensation
and higher costs of medical insurance. The higher level of driver compensation
expense in 2000, was due to changes in the mix of drivers and not a pay rate
change. Rents and purchased transportation expense increased .8% and declined
slightly as a percentage of revenue, reflecting a substantial decrease in
purchased transportation, due to the contribution of the JBL segment business,
offset by an increase in rent expense for leased revenue equipment as discussed
below. Fuel and fuel tax expense increased 43.3% and rose to 11.3% of revenue
in 2000, from 8.3% in 1999. Fuel expense was driven by an approximate 35%
higher cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon. Fuel
surcharges, which were initiated in late 1999, recovered approximately 90% of
higher fuel costs during 2000.

     Depreciation expense decreased 9.8% and also declined as a percentage of
revenue, primarily due to transactions to sell and leaseback certain trailing
equipment in 2000 and 1999. These transactions and a decision to rent, rather
than buy, additional trailers decreased depreciation expense and increased
rents and purchased transportation expenses in 2000. Operating supplies and
expenses increased 4.1%, but remained approximately the same percentage of
revenue in 2000 and 1999. The 20.4% increase in operating taxes and licenses
expense was due to the larger size of the tractor fleet and a higher state base
plate cost per tractor in 2000. Communication and utility costs were up 15.1%,
primarily due to expanded data and telecommunications networks and higher
satellite communication expenses.

     Interest expense declined 9.2% in 2000, primarily due to the reduction of
average debt balances in 2000 versus 1999, resulting from the sale and
leaseback transactions. The equity in earnings of associated companies amounts
represent the Company's share of earnings from operations in Mexico and from
TPC. Earnings recognized from Mexican operations in 2000 totaled $4.3 million,
compared with $3.1 million in 1999. Earnings recognized from TPC were $440,000
in 2000. The effective income tax rates were approximately 15% in 2000 and 35%
in 1999. The primary reason for the decrease in the year 2000 effective income
tax rate was the benefit of the amortization of the gain on the sale and
leaseback transaction, which closed in late 1999.

     As a result of the above, net earnings for 2000 were $36.1 million, or
diluted earnings per share of $1.02, compared with $31.9 million in 1999, or
$.89 per diluted share. The average number of shares outstanding remained
substantially the same in 2000 and in 1999.

SUMMARY OF 1999

     The 1999 financial and operating results were impacted by a number of
significant items during the year. Van (JBT and JBI combined) revenue growth
was limited to 3%, partly due to rail service delays which occurred during the
second and third quarters of 1999. JBT loads increased about 6%, while JBI load
count declined approximately 3% during 1999. Tractor count in the Van segment
was essentially flat for the year. JBT revenue per loaded mile, before fuel
surcharges, was up approximately 1%, while JBI rates declined about 1%. Van
revenue growth increased slightly during the fourth quarter of 1999 due to fuel
surcharges which were initiated as fuel costs began to rise significantly.
Operating income in the Van segment was reduced, in part, by higher revenue
equipment maintenance and tire costs, and significant increases in the cost of
fuel. In addition, an initiative to separate the JBT and JBI businesses
resulted in higher third party dray expense during the latter part of 1999.

     DCS segment revenue grew 51% to $320.2 million in 1999 from $211.9 million
in 1998. This increase in DCS revenue was driven by new customer contracts and
projects and fleet additions to existing contracts. The higher level of DCS
operating income during 1999 was primarily due to the growth of segment
revenue. Margins in the DCS business declined slightly during 1999, partly due
to higher fuel costs and higher driver wage expense. The 22% increase in JBL
segment revenue during 1999 was consistent with the prior year. This growth
reflected new logistics agreements with new customers and growth of business
volumes with existing customers. The increase in 1999 JBL operating income was
primarily related to higher revenue levels with some lower purchased
transportation costs providing for slightly better margins on some business.

     The operating losses classified as "other" in 1999 and 1998 were primarily
a result of corporate administrative expenses which were not allocated to the
business segments.






RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     1999 COMPARED WITH 1998





The following table sets forth items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of
those items as compared with the prior year.







OPERATING EXPENSES
     Total operating expenses in 1999 increased 13.3% over 1998, while total
operating revenues increased 11.0%. Operating expenses expressed as a percentage
of operating revenues (operating ratio) were 96.4% in 1999, compared with 94.5%
in 1998. Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 11.0% during 1999 and
remained exactly the same percentage of operating revenue for 1999 and 1998.
Rents and purchased transportation expense increased 11.2% and also maintained a
consistent relationship with operating revenues. While fuel costs were below
prior year levels during the first quarter of 1999, cost per gallon started to
rise during March and April. During the third quarter of 1999, fuel prices
averaged nearly $.20 per gallon higher than the comparable period in 1998 and
the spread widened to nearly $.30 per gallon by November of 1999. For the year
1999, fuel and fuel taxes increased 23.2% and grew from 7.5% of operating
revenue in 1998 to 8.3% in 1999.

     Depreciation expense increased 6.1% during 1999, but declined slightly as
a percentage of operating revenues. The amount of depreciation expense on
revenue equipment increased in relative proportion to the size of the fleet.
Depreciation expense in 1999 was reduced, in part, by a sale and immediate
leaseback of certain trailing equipment. This transaction closed during the
fourth quarter of 1999. Operating supplies and expenses increased 29.2% during
1999 and rose as a percentage of operating revenues. This increase was
primarily due to higher revenue equipment maintenance and tire expenditures
during 1999.

     Insurance and claims expense, which had declined significantly from 1997
to 1998, increased 24.1% in 1999. While the frequency of vehicle collisions
declined slightly during 1999, the severity, or cost per collision, rose
significantly during 1999. Operating taxes and licenses increased 12.9% during
1999, partly due to the growth of the tractor fleet and increases in licensing
fees charged by certain states. General and administrative expenses increased
33.1%, but remained nearly the same percentage of operating revenue for both
years. A portion of this increased expense was for rental and maintenance of
computer equipment. Communication and utilities increased 10.8%, reflecting
expanded data and telecommunications networks and higher satellite
communications costs. Interest expense declined slightly and the effective
income tax rate declined to 35% in 1999 from 37% in 1998. These decreases were
due, in part, to the sale and leaseback transaction described above. The
overall impact of this sale and leaseback transaction increased 1999 earnings
per share by approximately $.02.

     As a result of the above, net earnings for 1999 declined to $31.9 million,
or diluted earnings per share of $.89, compared with $46.8 million in 1998, or
$1.28 per diluted share. The average number of weighted average shares
outstanding (before the effect of dilutive stock options) remained
substantially the same for 1999 and 1998. A decrease in weighted average shares
assuming dilution resulted from the decreased effect of dilutive stock options
caused by a decline in the Company's average price of common stock during 1999.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
     The Company generates significant amounts of cash from operating
activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $125 million in 2000,
$136 million in 1999 and $181 million in 1998. The decline in cash flow over the
past two years partly reflects the Company's decision to acquire new revenue
equipment through operating leases rather than purchase. Other factors impacting
cash flow have been increases in prepaid lease and insurance costs in 2000;
increases in accounts receivable in 1999 and 1998, a trend which was reversed in
2000, with the contribution of JBL to TPC and improvements in the receivable
aging.

     Net cash used in investing activities was $100 million in 2000, $19
million in 1999 and $259 million in 1998. The primary use of funds for
investing activities was the acquisition of new revenue equipment. The number
of new tractors purchased totaled approximately 1,900 in 2000, 2,200 in 1999,
2,900 in 1998. The amount of investment spending to acquire trailing equipment
varied significantly during the three year period ended December 31, 2000. The
total number of trailing pieces of equipment purchased was approximately 3,600
in 2000, 2,200 in 1999 and 4,700 in 1998. Net cash used for investing
activities in 2000 was reduced by the sale and leaseback of approximately $66
million of trailers in September of 2000. Net cash used for investing
activities in 1999 was reduced by a sale and immediate leaseback of





approximately $175 million of trailing equipment. The Company also elected to
rent a significant number of trailers during 2000. As mentioned previously, a
$5 million cash investment in TPC was also made in 2000.

     Net financing activities consumed approximately $32 million in 2000 and
$113 million in 1999, but generated $83 million in 1998. Proceeds from the sale
and leaseback of trailing equipment which approximated $66 million in 2000 and
$175 million in 1999 were used to reduce commercial paper note balances and
long-term debt. The Company sold $100 million of 7.00% senior notes in
September of 1998, which mature in September of 2004. Financing activities also
included the purchase of treasury stock, which totaled $7.6 million in 2000 and
$5.8 million in 1998. Dividends of approximately $1.8 million were paid in 2000
and $7.1 million were paid in both 1999 and 1998. The Company announced in
February of 2000, a decision to discontinue paying dividends. In January of
2001, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings of the Company's senior
unsecured debt to Baa3 from Baa2 and its commercial paper to Prime-3 from
Prime-2.

     During 2000, the Company entered into various capital lease agreements to
lease revenue equipment with a net book value of approximately $94 million.



     The Company is authorized to issue up to $150 million in notes under a
commercial paper note program, of which $74 million was outstanding at December
31, 2000.

     From time to time the Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of
Company common stock. Purchases of Company stock were:



     At December 31, 2000, the Company had committed to purchase approximately
$90 million of revenue and service equipment net of expected proceeds from sale
or trade-in allowances. Additional capital spending for new revenue equipment is
anticipated during 2001, however, funding for such expenditures is expected to
come from cash generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities. The
Company had approximately $75.6 million of unused borrowing capacity under its
committed revolving lines of credit.


YEAR 2000
- ---------

     The Company did not experience any material Year 2000 problems or
disruptions with internal systems, and has not experienced any material problems
or disruptions with customers or suppliers systems.





RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 establishes new
accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for
hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires an entity to measure all derivatives at
fair value and to recognize them in the balance sheet as an asset or liability,
depending on the entity's rights or obligations under the applicable derivative
contract. The recognition of changes in fair value of a derivative that affect
the income statement will depend on the intended use of the derivative. If the
derivative does not qualify as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss on the
derivative will be recognized currently in earnings. If the derivative qualifies
for special hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the derivative will either (1)
be recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the
item being hedged or (2) be deferred in other comprehensive income and
reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. SFAS 133 was amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138 ("SFAS 138") in June 2000 that amended the
accounting and reporting standards of SFAS 133 for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities. SFAS 138 also amended SFAS 133 for
decisions made by the FASB relating to the Derivatives Implementation Group
process. The Company has completed its analysis of Statement 133 and does not
expect adoption as of January 1, 2001 to have a material effect on results of
operations or financial position.


FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
     This report contains statements that may be considered as forward-looking
or predictions concerning future operations. Such statements are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These statements are based on management's belief or interpretation of
information currently available. Shareholders and prospective investors are
cautioned that actual results and experience may differ materially from the
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. Among all the factors
and events that are not within the Company's control and could have a material
impact on future operating results are general economic conditions, cost and
availability of diesel fuel, adverse weather conditions and competitive rate
fluctuations and availability of drivers. Current and future changes in fuel
prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly earnings. Financial
and operating results of the Company may fluctuate as a result of these and
other risk factors as detailed from time to time in Company filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.



ITEM 7a.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

       The Company's earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest
rates as a result of its issuance of short-term commercial paper. The Company
from time to time utilizes interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes; none were outstanding at December 31, 2000. Risk can be
estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in
short-term market interest rates. If short-term market interest rates average
10% more during the next twelve months, there would be no material adverse
impact on the Company's results of operations based on variable rate debt
outstanding at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2000, the fair value of the
Company's fixed rate long-term obligations approximated carrying value.

       Although the Company conducts business in foreign countries,
international operations are not material to the Company's consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, foreign
currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the Company's results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. Accordingly, the Company is
not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the
effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the
Company's future costs or on future cash flows it would receive from its foreign
investment. To date, the Company has not entered into any foreign currency
forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge
the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

(1)    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       (a)    Description of Business

              J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its
              wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Company"), is a diversified
              transportation services company operating under the jurisdiction
              of the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state
              regulatory agencies.

              The Company has four distinct operating segments: Truck;
              Intermodal; Logistics; and Dedicated Contract Services. See note
              10.

       (b)    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

              The consolidated financial statements include the financial
              statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
              significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
              eliminated in consolidation.

       (c)    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

              For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company
              considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
              maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

       (d)    TIRES IN SERVICE

              The Company capitalizes tires placed in service on new revenue
              equipment as a part of the equipment cost. Replacement tires and
              costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are
              placed in service.

       (e)    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

              Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the
              straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 10
              years for revenue and service equipment, 10 to 40 years for
              structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and
              office equipment.

              Property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the
              present value of minimum lease payments; and amortized over the
              straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or
              estimated useful life of the asset.

       (f)    REVENUE RECOGNITION
              The Company recognizes revenue based on relative transit time in
              each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.


                                      25                             (Continued)

                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


       (g)    INCOME TAXES

              Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
              method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
              future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
              financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
              liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
              tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
              measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
              income in the years in which those temporary differences are
              expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
              assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
              income in the period that includes the enactment date.

        (h)   EARNINGS PER SHARE

              A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and
              diluted earnings per share is shown below (in thousands, except
              per share amounts):




                                      26                             (Continued)



                       J. B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


              Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding
              during each year but were not included in the computation of
              diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price was
              greater than the average market price of the common shares are
              shown in the table below.




       (i)    CREDIT RISK

              Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
              concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade
              receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
              receivables are limited due to the Company's large number of
              customers and the diverse range of industries which they
              represent. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had no
              significant concentrations of credit risk.

       (j)    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

              Local currencies are generally considered the functional
              currencies outside the United States. Assets and liabilities are
              translated at year-end exchange rates for operations in local
              currency environments. Income and expense items are translated at
              average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

              Foreign currency translation adjustments, which reflect foreign
              currency exchange rate changes applicable to the net assets of the
              Mexican operations have been recorded as a separate item of
              accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity for
              the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000. For the year ended
              December 31, 1998, Mexico was considered a highly inflationary
              economy as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
              ("SFAS") No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Accordingly, the
              more stable currency of the reporting parent (the Company) was
              used, and the effect of exchange rates resulting in translation
              adjustments have been recorded as a component of net earnings for
              the year ended December 31, 1998. As of January 1, 1999, Mexico is
              no longer considered a highly inflationary economy.

       (k)    STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

              The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
              123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and, as permitted
              under SFAS No. 123, applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
              No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for compensation
              costs for its stock option plans. Accordingly, compensation
              expense is recognized on the date of grant only if the current
              market price of the underlying common stock at date of grant
              exceeds the exercise price.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


       (l)    IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE
              DISPOSED OF

              The Company continually evaluates the carrying value of its assets
              for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the
              carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
              be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying
              amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
              generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
              impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
              amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair
              value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
              lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

       (m)    USE OF ESTIMATES

              Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
              assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities
              and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare
              the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally
              accepted accounting principles. Actual results could differ from
              those estimates.

       (n)    COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

              Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and foreign currency
              translation adjustments and is presented in the consolidated
              statements of stockholders' equity.

       (o)    RECLASSIFICATIONS

              To conform to the 2000 presentation, certain accounts for 1999 and
              1998 have been reclassified. The reclassifications had no effect
              on net earnings and stockholders' equity previously reported.

(2)    LONG-TERM DEBT

       Long-term debt consists of (in thousands):




       Under its commercial paper note program, the Company is authorized to
       issue up to $150 million in notes. These notes are supported by credit
       agreements, which aggregate $150 million, with a group of banks, which
       expires December 14, 2001. The effective rate on the commercial note
       program was 7.28% and 5.32% as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
       respectively. The 7.80% senior subordinated notes are payable in five
       equal annual installments beginning October 30, 2000. Under the terms of
       the credit agreements, the Company had additional unused borrowing
       capacity of approximately $75.6 million at December 31, 2000.

       Under the terms of the credit agreements and the note agreements, the
       Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants including
       leverage tests, minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial
       ratios. The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants
       at December 31, 2000.

       Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2000 consist of
       commercial paper due in 2001 and the second installment of the 7.80%
       senior subordinated notes. The aggregate annual maturities of long-term
       debt for each of the four years ending December 31 are as follows (in
       thousands): 2001, $84,400; 2002, $10,000; 2003, $108,260; and 2004,
       $105,000.

(3)    CAPITAL STOCK

       The Company maintains a Management Incentive Plan ("Plan") that provides
       various vehicles to compensate key employees with Company common stock or
       common stock equivalents. Under the original Plan, the Company was
       authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than 5,000,000 shares. During
       1998 and again in 2000, the stockholders of the Company amended the Plan
       whereby the Company is now authorized to award, in aggregate, not more
       than 8,500,000 shares. At December 31, 2000 there were approximately
       1,935,000 shares available for grant under the Plan. The Company has
       utilized three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to purchase
       the Company's common stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options
       and nonstatutory stock options.

       Restricted stock awards are granted to key employees subject to
       restrictions regarding transferability and assignment. Shares of Company
       common stock are issued to the key employees and held by the Company
       until each employee becomes vested in the award. Vesting of the awards
       generally occurs over a four-year period of time from the award date.
       Termination of the employee for any reason other than death, disability
       or certain cases of retirement causes the unvested portion of the award
       to be forfeited.


                                      29                             (Continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


       The Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key
       employees for the purchase of Company common stock for 100% of the fair
       market value of the common stock at the grant date. The options generally
       vest over a ten-year period and are forfeited if the employee terminates
       for any reason. The Company amended certain vested options related to
       employees of its logistics segment, extending the exercise period after
       termination. This resulted in a remeasurement of these options and
       accordingly $110,000 was charged to compensation expense in 2000.

       Compensation expense (benefit) under the Plan for restricted stock awards
       is charged to earnings over the vesting period and amounted to
       approximately $0, ($5,400), and $20,000 for the years ended December 31,
       2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

       A summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase Company
       common stock follows:




       During 1995, the Board of Directors established a nonqualified stock
       option plan to provide performance based compensation to the Chairman of
       the Board. The plan allows the Chairman the option to purchase up to 2.5
       million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $17.63 per
       share. These options vested after five years. Under the original plan the
       options must be exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised
       options will terminate. During 2000, the stockholders of the Company
       amended the plan whereby the exercise period was extended to be within
       two years of vesting.


                                      30                             (Continued)



                       J. B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


       Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at
       the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's
       net earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
       below.




       Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted since December 31,
       1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation costs for
       stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net
       earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is reflected
       over the options' vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation cost
       for options granted prior to January 1, 1996 is not considered.

       The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during
       2000, 1999 and 1998 was $9.07, $4.13 and $13.23, respectively, on the
       date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the
       following weighted-average assumptions: 2000 - expected dividend yield
       0.0%, volatility of 52.4%, risk-free interest rate of 5.2%, and an
       expected life of 6.6 years; 1999 - expected dividend yield 1.2%,
       volatility of 51.6%, risk-free interest rate of 6.5%, and an expected
       life of 7.3 years; 1998 - expected dividend yield .9%, volatility of
       65.5%, risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, and an expected life of 7.7
       years.

       The following table summarizes information about stock options
       outstanding at December 31, 2000:

(4)    INCOME TAXES

       Total income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
       1998 was allocated as follows (in thousands):




       Refundable income taxes at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $3,133,000 and
       $3,000,000, respectively. These amounts have been included in other
       current assets on the balance sheet.

       Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings before income taxes
       consists of (in thousands):




       Income tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes differed
       from the amounts computed using the statutory federal tax rate of 35% for
       the following reasons (in thousands):




                                      32                             (Continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                        December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998


       The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
       portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at
       December 31, 2000 and 1999 are presented below (in thousands):




       The Company believes its history of profitability and taxable income, the
       reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and its utilization of tax planning
       sufficiently supports the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets.
       Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance as all
       deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

       At December 31, 2000, the Company had available net operating loss
       ("NOL") carryforwards of approximately $104,915,000 expiring from the
       year 2007 to 2017. Additionally, the Company had general business tax
       credit carryforwards of approximately $4,405,000 expiring from the year
       2007 to 2009, and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with no
       expiration of approximately $4,700,000.


                                      33                             (Continued)

 (5)   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

       The Company maintains a defined contribution employee retirement plan,
       which includes a 401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to
       participate. The Company matches a specified percentage of employee
       contributions, subject to certain limitations. For the years ended
       December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, total Company contributions to the
       plan, including matching 401(k) contributions, were $6,553,000,
       $7,348,000 and $6,533,000, respectively.

(6)    FAIR VALUE OF SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       (a)    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE ACCOUNTS
              PAYABLE

              The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
              maturity of these instruments.

       (b)    LONG-TERM DEBT

              The carrying amount of the commercial paper debt approximates the
              fair value because of the short maturity of the commercial paper
              instruments.

              The fair value of the fixed rate debt is presented as the present
              value of future cash flows discounted using the Company's current
              borrowing rate for notes of comparable maturity. The calculation
              arrives at a theoretical amount the Company would pay a
              creditworthy third party to assume its fixed rate obligations and
              not the termination value of these obligations. Consistent with
              market practices, such termination values may include various
              prepayment and termination fees that the Company would
              contractually be required to pay if it retired the debt early.

              The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments
              are summarized as follows (in thousands):




                                      34                             (Continued)

(7)    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       The Company advances premiums on life insurance policies on the lives of
       the Company's principal stockholder and his wife. All premiums paid by
       the Company, along with accrued interest thereon, are reimbursable from a
       trust which is the owner and beneficiary of the policy. The Company has a
       guarantee from the stockholder for the amount of premiums paid by the
       Company together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum until June of
       2000. In July of 2000 the Board of Directors approved an adjustment to
       the interest rate to be the average borrowing rate of the Company for
       July 2000 which was 7.15%. The amounts reimbursable to the Company amount
       to approximately $8,002,000 and $7,044,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
       respectively, and are included in other assets in the accompanying
       consolidated balance sheets. See also note 9 for disclosure of
       transactions with an associated company.

(8)    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

       During 1999, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback transaction
       for a portion of its container fleet. Containers having a net book value
       of approximately $175,000,000 were sold to third party leasing companies
       at approximate net book value. A gain on the transaction has been
       deferred and will be amortized to income in relation to rent expense
       recognized under the leases. The containers are being leased back under
       operating leases over terms of four to ten years. The Company also leases
       terminal facilities, shuttle yards and computer equipment under operating
       leases having various terms. Under the terms of certain lease agreements,
       the Company is required to maintain certain covenants including minimum
       credit ratings. The Company was in compliance with this requirement at
       December 31, 2000.

       During 2000 the Company entered into various capital lease agreements to
       lease revenue equipment. These capital leases are secured by revenue
       equipment with a net book value at December 31, 2000 of approximately
       $94,000,000 and contain certain guarantees of residual value at the end
       of the lease terms with fixed price purchase options.











                                      35                             (Continued)

       Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with
       initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) and future
       minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 2000 are:




       At December 31, 2000 gross property and equipment and accumulated
       amortization recorded under capital leases was $97,553,000 and
       $3,158,000, respectively.

       Total rent expense was $87,545,000 in 2000, $39,862,000 in 1999, and
       $28,692,000 in 1998, respectively.

       At December 31, 2000, the Company had committed to purchase approximately
       $90,000,000 of revenue and service equipment net of expected proceeds
       from sale or trade-in allowances.

       The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising
       from the normal conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of
       the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management
       believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a
       material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of
       operations of the Company.

(9)    INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANY

       In March 2000, the Company, along with five other motor carriers,
       announced the intent to contribute all of its non-asset based logistics
       business into a recently formed joint venture, Transplace.com (TPC). TPC
       is an internet-based global transportation logistics company. TPC
       commenced operations effective July 1, 2000. The Company contributed all
       of its logistics segment business and all related intangible assets, plus
       $5.0 million of cash, in exchange for an approximate 27% initial
       membership interest in TPC. The Company accounts for its approximate 27%
       interest in TPC utilizing the equity method of accounting. No gain or
       loss was recognized upon formation and contribution of logistics segment
       assets to TPC. The excess of the Company's share of TPC's net assets over
       its cost basis is being amortized over 20 years on a straight-line
       method. Equity in earnings of TPC was not significant in 2000.

       The Company provided various services to TPC under a shared service
       agreement, the terms of which expired on December 31, 2000. The services
       included the following: payroll and benefits; accounting; computer system
       maintenance; office facilities; and telecommunications. The fees from
       these services approximated $2,971,000 in 2000 and were recorded in the
       consolidated statement of earnings as reimbursements of salaries, wages
       and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses.

       At December 31, 2000, the Company had advanced to TPC in the form of a
       loan $5,600,000. This amount was repaid in full during January 2001.

       The Company earned revenues of $43,500,000 from TPC in providing
       transportation services in the last six months of 2000.

       At December 31, 2000, trade accounts receivable includes $1,148,000 due
       from TPC for freight and fees related to the shared service agreement.

(10)   SEGMENT INFORMATION

       The Company had four reportable business segments during 2000. Segments
       included Truck (JBT), Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract Services (DCS)
       and Logistics. JBT business includes full truck-load, dry-van freight
       which is typically transported utilizing company-owned or controlled
       revenue equipment. This freight is typically transported over roads and
       highways and does not move by rail. The JBI segment includes freight
       which is transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement
       and also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI
       equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended
       to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal operations. The JBT and
       JBI business segments were operated in combined fashion (formally
       reported as Van/Intermodal in prior periods) and limited identifiable
       comparative information is available for JBT and JBI prior to January 1,
       2000. Accordingly, the Company has provided comparable segment
       information for the year ended December 31, 2000 based on the prior
       segmentation, which included JBT and JBI as the former segment,
       "Van/Intermodal".

       DCS segment business typically includes company-owned revenue equipment
       and employee drivers which are assigned to a specific customer, traffic
       lane or service. DCS operations usually include formal, written long-term
       agreements or contracts which govern services performed and applicable
       rates.

       Prior to July 1, 2000, the Logistics business segment primarily consisted
       of J. B. Hunt Logistics (JBL) a wholly-owned subsidiary which provided a
       wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management
       services. Such services included experienced professional managers,
       information and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign
       of freight system solutions. JBL utilized JBT, JBI or DCS owned or
       controlled assets and employees, or third-party carriers, or a
       combination to meet customer service requirements. JBL services typically
       were provided in accordance with written long-term agreements. As
       discussed in Note 9, the Company exchanged its ownership in JBL for an
       initial membership interest in TPC. Effective July 1, 2000, the Company
       began accounting for its ownership in TPC utilizing the equity method of
       accounting. As of December 31, 2000, TPC qualifies as a reportable
       business segment and, accordingly, the Logistics segment information
       shown below includes both JBL and TPC. Information for TPC included in
       the following tables is the entity's results of operations without regard
       to the Company's ownership interest which is then subtracted in
       reconciling to the consolidated statement of earnings.
