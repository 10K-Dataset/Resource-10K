PART I

ITEM
1.   BUSINESS

GENERAL

J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“JBHT”), is a
diversified transportation services company operating under the jurisdiction of
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and various state regulatory
agencies.  JBHT is an Arkansas holding
company incorporated on August 10, 1961. 
JBHT has been a publicly held company since our initial public offering
in 1983.  Through our subsidiaries and
associated companies, we provide a wide range of logistics and transportation
services to a diverse group of customers. 
We directly manage or provide tailored, technology-driven solutions to a
growing list of Fortune 500 companies. 
These customers may request specifically targeted transportation service
or outsource their entire transportation function to us, or an associated
company.  We also directly transport
full-load containerizable freight throughout the continental United States and
portions of Canada and Mexico. 
Transportation services may utilize our equipment and employees, or may
employ equipment and services provided by associated or unrelated third parties
in the transportation industry.  We had
three reportable business segments during calendar year 2002.  These segments include full truck-load,
dry-van (JBT), intermodal (JBI) and dedicated contract services (DCS).  In addition, we operated a logistics
business segment from 1992 until mid 2000. 
Effective July 1, 2000, JBHT, along with five other publicly-held
transportation companies, contributed our logistics business to a new, commonly
owned company, Transplace, Inc.

JBT SEGMENT

Primary transportation
service offerings classified in this segment include full truck-load, dry-van
freight which is predominantly transported utilizing company-owned revenue
equipment.  Freight is picked up at the
dock or specified location of the shipper and transported directly to the
location of the consignee.  The load may
be transported entirely by our power equipment or a portion of the movement may
be handled by a third-party motor carrier. Typically, the charges for the
entire movement are billed to the customer by us and we, in turn, pay the
third-party for their portion of the transportation services provided.  JBT operates utilizing certain Canadian
authorities which were initially granted in 1988 and may transport freight to
and from all points in the continental United States to Quebec, British
Columbia and Ontario.  We have
authorization to operate directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date we
have served limited points in Canada, primarily through interchange operations
with Canadian motor carriers.  We
operated our JBT and JBI segments in combined fashion in periods prior to
January 1, 2000.  This combined
operation was reported as Van/Intermodal (“Van”) in prior periods.  In late 2000, we began utilizing independent
contractors on a limited basis in the JBT segment.  These independent contractors (I/C’s) provide their own tractors
and agree to transport freight in JBHT owned or controlled trailing
equipment.  At December 31, 2002,
approximately 680 I/C’s were operating in the JBT segment.  JBT gross revenue for calendar year 2002 was
$827 million, compared with $829 million in 2001.  At December 31, 2002, the JBT segment operated 4,924 company owned
tractors and employed 7,573 people, 5,541 of whom were drivers.

JBI SEGMENT

Transportation service
offerings of our JBI segment utilize agreements with various railroads to
provide proven intermodal freight solutions to our customers in all major lanes
of commerce in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  We differentiate ourselves from others through our premium
service network, as well as, coordinated door to door service on company-owned
and controlled assets.  We established
our first intermodal agreement with the Santa Fe Railway in 1989.  Through growth of this transportation
segment and additions, deletions, and mergers of rail carriers, we now have
agreements with seven North American rail carriers including:  BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX, Kansas City
Southern, Union Pacific, Canadian National, and Florida East Coast
railroads.  Typically, freight is picked
up at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transported to the rail
carrier for loading on rail cars.  Upon
completion of the rail routing, the freight is picked up at the rail carrier’s
ramp and transported to the consignee. 
These originating and destination drays may be transported entirely by
our power equipment or may be handled by a third-party motor carrier.  It is our customary business practice that
all charges for the entire movement are billed to the customer by us and we, in
turn, pay the rail carrier and third-party motor carrier for their portion of
the transportation services provided. 
In 1993, rail operations were expanded to utilize high-cube containers
which can be separated from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars to
provide improved productivity.  This
concept is known as container-on-flatcar. 
Most of our agreements with rail carriers allow for the majority of JBI
business carried under these rail agreements to receive priority space on
trains and preferential loading and unloading at rail facilities.  JBI gross revenue for calendar year 2002 was
$809 million, compared with $740 million in


2001.  At December 31, 2002, the JBI segment
operated 917 tractors and employed 1,557 people, 1,215 of whom were drivers.

DCS SEGMENT

Since 1992, we have
offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option.  DCS segment operations specialize in the
design, development, and execution of supply chain solutions.  Capitalizing on advanced systems and
technologies, DCS offers engineered transportation solutions that support private
fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation, and transportation system
augmentation.  DCS operations typically
provide customized services that are governed by long-term contracts and
currently include dry van, flatbed, and temperature-controlled operations.  Near 100% on-time service is standard with
efficient routes executed to design specifications.

DCS operations focus on
driving out cost and enhancing customer value through leveraging the JBHT
network for backhaul repositioning freight. 
Network freight may be used to reposition equipment near outbound
domiciles,  thereby reducing inefficient
empty miles and system cost.  DCS also
frequently finds synergy in shared resources with the JBT and JBI segments
including terminals, drivers, maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations, and
trailer pools providing further economies of scale.  DCS gross revenue for calendar year 2002 was $628 million,
compared with $549 million in 2001.  At
December 31, 2002, the DCS segment operated 4,812 tractors and employed 5,989
people, 5,273 of whom were drivers.

LOGISTICS BUSINESS AND ASSOCIATED COMPANY

We formally began
offering logistics transportation services in 1992 through a wholly-owned
subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics (JBL). 
JBL services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might
outsource a substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation
process to one organization.  The JBL
segment business included a wide range of comprehensive transportation and
management services including experienced professional managers, information
and optimization technology, and the actual design or redesign of system
solutions.  A new logistics customer or
service arrangement may have required a significant amount of up-front analysis
and design time, while alternatives were considered and custom systems and
software were developed.  Effective July
1, 2000, we contributed substantially all of our JBL segment business, all
related intangible assets and $5 million of cash to a newly-formed,
commonly-owned company, Transplace, Inc. (“TPI”).

TPI is an Internet-based
global transportation logistics company. 
TPI commenced operations in July of 2000 and initially included
substantially all of the logistics business of JBHT, Covenant Transport, Inc.;
Swift Transportation Co., Inc; U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.; and Werner
Enterprises, Inc.  TPI gross revenue for
calendar year 2002 approximated $672 million, which revenue is not included in
our financial statements for 2002.  We
initially had an approximate 27% ownership interest in TPI.  In November of 2002, we agreed to purchase a
portion of Werner Enterprises’ (Werner) ownership interest in TPI.  Effective January 1, 2003, our interest in
TPI increased from 27% to 37% and Werner’s interest declined from 15% to 5%.  The financial results of TPI are included on
a one-line, non-operating item included on our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings entitled “Equity in earnings (loss) of associated companies.”

ASSOCIATED
COMPANY - MEXICO

We have provided
transportation services to and from Mexico since 1989.  These services frequently involve equipment
interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers.  In addition, a joint venture agreement with
Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), one of the largest transportation
companies in Mexico, was signed in 1992. 
The joint venture, Comercializadora Internacional de Carga S.A. de C.V.
and its subsidiaries, originated and completed northbound and southbound
international truck movements between the U.S. and Mexico.  The joint venture also provided Mexican domestic
irregular route truck service, refrigerated freight services, Mexican dedicated
contract business and short-haul drayage to and from the Mexican maritime ports
and rail heads.  For the calendar year
ended December 31, 2001 and for prior years, our share of the Mexican joint
venture operating results was included on a one-line, non-operating item on the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled “Equity in earnings (loss) of
associated companies.  During the first
quarter of 2002, we sold our joint venture interest in Mexico to TMM.  We still provide transportation services to
and from Mexico by utilizing the services of a variety of Mexican carriers.


MARKETING AND OPERATIONS

We transport a wide range
of products including automotive parts, department store merchandise, paper and
wood products, food and beverages, plastics, chemicals and manufacturing
materials and supplies.  Our primary
customers include many of the “Fortune 500” companies.  Our largest customer in 2002 was Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 18% of total revenue.  A broad geographic dispersion and a good
balance in the type of freight transported allows us some protection from major
seasonal fluctuations.  However,
consistent with the truckload industry in general, freight is typically
stronger during the second half of the year, with peak volume occurring in
August through mid November.  Revenue
and earnings are also affected by bad weather, holidays, fuel prices, driver
cost and availability, and railroad service levels.

We generally market all
of our service offerings through a nationwide marketing network.  All transportation services offered are
typically billed directly to the customer by us and all inquiries, claims and
other customer contacts are handled by us. 
Certain marketing, sales, engineering and design functions are assigned
to each operating segment.  However,
marketing and pricing strategy, and national account service coordination is
managed at the corporate level.

PERSONNEL

At December 31, 2002, we
employed 16,265 people, including 12,029 drivers.  Historically the truckload transportation industry and JBHT have
experienced shortages of qualified drivers. 
In addition, driver turnover rates for truckload motor carriers
frequently exceed 100%.  During the past
few years a number of changes have occurred within the industry relative to
drivers.  In 1996, we announced and
implemented an approximate 33% increase in wages for our over-the-road drivers.  As anticipated, this increase in driver
compensation was partially offset by lower driver recruiting and training
expense, reduced accident and safety costs and better equipment utilization.  We also experienced a decline in driver
turnover rates between 1997 and 1999. 
During late 2000 and 2001, supply and demand conditions for drivers
changed and a number of truck load carriers, including JBHT, implemented lower
mileage pay rates for newly hired drivers. 
Partly as a result of this reduced compensation level for drivers, our
driver turnover rate increased during 2000 and has remained at historically
high levels in 2001 and 2002.  During
calendar year 2002, we have once again experienced some difficulty attracting
and retaining a desired level of drivers. 
To date, we continue to hire only experienced drivers and, although
recruiting costs have increased significantly, operations have not been
disrupted by a shortage of qualified drivers. 
At December 31, 2002, we also employed approximately 3,100 office
employees and 1,137 mechanics.  None of
our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.

REVENUE EQUIPMENT

At December 31, 2002, we
owned or leased 10,653 company operated tractors, 26,087 trailers and 19,672
containers.  We believe that modern,
late-model, clean equipment differentiates quality customer service, increases
equipment utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime.  We generally operate with newer revenue
equipment in the JBT segment, with the age of tractors and trailers
approximating 2.1 years and 2.2 years, respectively, at December 31, 2002.  Somewhat older equipment and tractors
designed for local and regional operations are typically utilized in the JBI
and DCS segments.  Specially designed
high-cube containers which can be separated from the chassis and double-stacked
on rail cars are also operated by JBI. 
The average age of JBI tractors and containers at December 31, 2002 was
approximately 4.6 years and 5.2 years, respectively.  The JBI segment commenced receiving brand new containers and
reconditioned chassis in late 2001. 
Approximately 6,300 new containers and 6,300 new and reconditioned
chassis were placed in service during 2002. 
The composition of the dedicated contract fleet varies with specific customer
service requirements.  At December 31,
2002, the average age of DCS segment tractors was 2.8 years.  In November of 2002, we committed to
purchase approximately 2,100 new tractors, the majority of which will be traded
one-for-one for units in the JBI and DCS fleets.  These trades will significantly reduce the average age of these
tractor fleets.  All of our revenue
equipment is maintained in accordance with a specific maintenance program
primarily based on age and/or miles traveled.

COMPETITION

We are one of the largest
publicly held truckload carriers in the United States. We compete primarily
with other irregular route, truckload common carriers. Less-than-truckload
common carriers and private carriers generally provide limited competition for
truckload carriers.  JBHT and our
associated companies are one of a few carriers offering nationwide logistics
management and dedicated revenue equipment services. Although a number of
carriers may provide competition on a regional basis, only a limited number of
companies represent competition in all markets. The extensive rail network
developed in conjunction with the various railroads also allows us the
opportunity to differentiate our services in the marketplace.


REGULATION

Our operations as a
for-hire carrier are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of
Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and by
various Canadian provinces.  Entry
control barriers were substantially removed as a result of federal deregulation
statutes such as the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995
(ICCTA).   The FMCSA continues to
enforce safety regulations and has proposed new rules which, if approved in
their present form, would limit driver’s hours of service.  President Bush is considering implementation
of provisions of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which may
result in increased competition between U.S. and Mexican carriers for truckload
services moving between these two countries. 
The Clean Air Act of 1990 established tighter pollution standards for
emissions from automobiles and trucks. 
These new standards were effective on a phased in basis beginning with
model year 1994.  As part of a 1998
consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a number of
heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions
from their engines produced subsequent to October 1, 2002.  JBHT and a number of other truckload motor
carriers believe the new engines have not yet been sufficiently tested for fuel
economy and reliability.  While we
continue to test a limited number of the new EPA compliant engines, we
committed in November of 2002 to purchase approximately 2,100 new tractors, the
majority of which will be equipped with Mercedes engines, which are not covered
by the EPA’s October 1, 2002 rules.

INTERNET WEB SITE

We maintain a web site on
the Internet through which additional information about JBHT is available.  Our web site address is www.jbhunt.com.  Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, press releases, earnings releases and other reports filed
pursuant to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Exchange Act are available, free of
charge, on our website as soon as practical after they are filed.

SEC FILINGS

We file annual, quarterly
and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Our
reports and any materials we file with the SEC are available at the Public
Reference Room, located at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20549. 
Information may be obtained from the Public Reference Room by calling
the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC also
maintains a web site at www.sec.gov that contains information we file with the
agency.  Our common stock is traded in
the over-the-counter market under the symbol “JBHT.”

ITEM
2.   PROPERTIES

Our corporate
headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. A 150,000-square-foot building was
constructed and occupied in September 1990. 
We also utilize our former corporate building as general offices.  In 1999, a new 20,000 square foot building
was constructed and occupied near the corporate headquarters.  A portion of this leased facility serves as
a backup data center and provides disaster recovery support services. An
additional 20,000 square foot building consisting of general office space for
our corporate employees was completed and occupied in 2000. This building is
located next to the data center building and is a leased facility.

Principal outside
facilities consist primarily of general offices which support operational,
safety and maintenance functions.  In
addition to the principal facilities listed below, we lease numerous small
offices and trailer parking yards in various locations throughout the country
to support customer trailing equipment pool commitments.


A summary of our
principal facilities follows:

7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains
statements that may be considered to be forward-looking or predictions
concerning future operations or events. 
Such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, subject to
risks and should be viewed with caution. 
These statements are based on our belief or interpretation of
information currently available. 
Shareholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual results
and future events may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as
a result of many factors.  Among all the
factors and events that are not within our control and could have a material
impact on future operating results include: 
general economic and business conditions, competition and competitive
rate fluctuations, cost and availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and
retain qualified drivers, a loss of one or more major customers, interference
with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads, insurance
costs and availability, claims expense, retention of key employees, terrorists
attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, new or different
environmental or other laws and regulations, increased costs for new revenue
equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of
revenue equipment manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for
guaranteed equipment trade-in values. 
Current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant
fluctuations of quarterly earnings.  The
above is not an all-inclusive list. 
Financial and operating results of JBHT may fluctuate as a result of
these and other risk factors or events as described from time to time in our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement
to the extent we become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Certain amounts included
in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be
estimated, requiring certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions
that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are
prepared.

The preparation of our
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:

•

the
amounts reported for assets and liabilities;

•

the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements; and

•

the
amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Therefore, the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated
disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily
affected by these estimates.  We
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience,
consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the
particular circumstances.  Nevertheless,
actual results may differ significantly from estimates.  Any effects on business, financial position
or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded
in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

In preparing our
financial statements and related disclosures, we must use estimates in
determining the economic useful lives of assets, provisions for uncollectible
accounts receivable, exposures under self-insurance plans and various other
recorded or disclosed amounts.  However,
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in the
financial statement preparation process than others and are discussed
below.  To the extent that actual
outcomes differ from estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us
to revise estimates, earnings will be affected.

Workers’ Compensation and Accident Costs

We purchase insurance
coverage for a portion of our expenses related to employee injuries (workers’
compensation), vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims.  Most insurance arrangements include a level
of self insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but provide
an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are
completely insured.  The amounts of self
insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and
policy expiration dates.  Our current
insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on the majority of our
claims is $1.5 million, which is prefunded with our insurance carrier.  We are substantially self-insured for loss
of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.  Our safety and claims personnel work directly
with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the
estimated ultimate cost of each claim. 
At December 31, 2002, we


had approximately $15
million of estimated net claims payable. 
In addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and
monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2002,
we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $45 million.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a significant
number of tractors, trailers and containers in connection with our
business.  This equipment may be
purchased or acquired under capital or operating leases.  In addition, we may rent revenue equipment
from third parties and various railroads under short-term rental
arrangements.  Revenue equipment which
is purchased is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  Equipment acquired under capital leases is
initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and
amortized on the straight-line method over the lease term or the estimated
useful life, whichever is shorter.

We have an agreement with
our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or trade-in values for
certain new equipment acquired since 1999. 
We have utilized these values in accounting for purchased and leased
tractors.  If the supplier was unable to
perform under the terms of such agreements, it could have a material negative
impact on our financial results.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue
based on the relative transit time of the freight transported.  Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue
which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in
each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and
delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.

Segments

We operated three
segments during calendar year 2002. 
Segments included Truck (JBT), Intermodal (JBI) and Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS).  JBT business included
full truck-load, dry-van freight which is primarily transported utilizing
company-owned or controlled revenue equipment. 
Freight in the JBT segment is typically transported over roads and
highways and no portion of a movement involves railroads.  The JBI segment includes freight which is
transported by rail over at least a portion of the movement.  JBI freight may also include certain
repositioning truck loads which are moved by JBI equipment or third-party
carriers, in circumstances where the movement directs JBI equipment back toward
intermodal operations.  DCS segment
business usually includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers
who are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS operations most frequently involve
formal, written long-term agreements which govern services performed and
applicable rates.

Prior to July 1, 2000,
the Logistics business segment (JBL) primarily consisted of J.B. Hunt
Logistics, a wholly-owned subsidiary which provided a wide range of
comprehensive transportation and freight management services.  Such services included experienced
professional managers, information and freight optimization technology and the
actual design or redesign of freight system solutions.  JBL utilized JBT, JBI or DCS owned or
controlled assets and employees, third-party carriers, or a combination of
these options to meet service requirements. 
JBL services were typically provided in accordance with written
long-term agreements.  Effective July 1,
2000, JBL exchanged its ownership in substantially all of its assets for an
initial membership interest in TPI.  As
of January 1, 2003, we increased our interest in TPI from approximately 27% to
37%.

For Years Ended
December 31

(in millions of
dollars)

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial
Statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report.

Overview of 2002

Our consolidated net
earnings for calendar year 2002 were $51.8 million, or diluted earnings per
share of $1.33, compared with 2001 full-year earnings of $32.9 million, or 91
cents per diluted share.  We generated
$101 million of operating income in 2002, a nearly 40% increase over the $72.2
million of operating income in 2001. 
Our operating ratio was 95.5% in 2002 and 96.6% in 2001.  Our increase in 2002 net earnings was in
spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to 30.8% from 23.5% in 2001
and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 8%.  The increase in shares outstanding reflects
a secondary public offering, which closed in June of 2002.   Each of our three segments contributed to
the improved earnings levels in 2002.

JBT segment gross revenue
was essentially flat, totaling $827.3 million in 2002 and $828.6 million in
2001.  However, 2002 revenues were
generated with approximately 3% fewer tractors.  In addition, 2002 fuel surcharge revenues were $14.2 million
lower than the comparable amount in 2001, which negatively impacted the revenue
comparison by approximately 2%.  Truck
segment operating income rose to $26.6 million in 2002, from $8.7 million in
2001.  The improvement in 2002 operating
income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile, reduced empty miles and lower
driver pay rates.  A significant portion
of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of
our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality.  The reduction in driver pay per mile was a
result of changes in pay scales for newly-hired drivers.

JBI segment gross revenue
grew 9%, to $809.1 million in 2002, from $740.5 million in 2001.  Revenue growth was due, in part, to
continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our
container fleet to 100% 53-foot units. 
Operating income in the JBI segment rose to $54.6 million in 2002 from
$42.1 million in 2001.  Our JBI
operating ratio was 93.3% in 2002 and 94.3% in 2001.  Financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved
container utilization, improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue
quality.

DCS segment revenue grew
nearly 15%, to $628.3 million in 2002, from $548.7 million in 2001.  Revenue growth was primarily a result of a
9% increase in the size of the DCS tractor fleet and our focus on improving the
quality of individual fleets.  While
operating income rose to $19.7 million in 2002 from $17.4 million in 2001, the
segment’s operating ratio was 96.9% in 2002 and 96.8% in 2001.  We reduced some costs in the DCS segment
such as driver pay and overhead, however, higher accident and claims expenses,
as well as new project start up costs, more than offset the improvements.


The following table sets
forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of
operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as
compared with the prior year.

Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses
in 2002 increased 5.9% over 2001, while operating revenues rose 7.0%.  Our operating ratio improved to 95.5% in
2002, compared with 96.6% in 2001. 
Salaries, wages and employee benefits expense increased 3.6% in 2002,
and declined to 36.4% of revenue in 2002 from 37.6% in 2001.  As previously mentioned, a lower mileage pay
rate in our JBT segment for newly-hired drivers and the use of additional
independent contractors were primary contributors to the relationship of this
cost category to operating revenues. 
Partly offsetting a decline in drivers’ wages relative to revenue were
increases in maintenance wages, workers’ compensation, health insurance and
office employee incentive expenses.  We
opened some new company managed maintenance facilities and increased our
mechanic labor force by about 14% in order to reduce the amount of maintenance
that we outsource.  We also experienced
higher costs in workers’ compensation and other fringe benefit programs and
paid additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel
that resulted from improved 2002 net earnings.

Rents and purchased
transportation expense increased 15.5%, primarily due to the growth of our JBI
business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and
the use of more independent contractors. 
The 6.8% decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily a result of
fuel costs per gallon averaging about 5% less vs. 2001.  Operating supplies and expenses were down
10.3% in 2002 reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced tractor and trailer
maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses.  The 32.4% increase in insurance and claims
costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums which have been
experienced industry wide and our higher accident costs.  The significant increase in general and administrative
expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and recruiting expense
in 2002 and changes in our gains and losses on revenue equipment
dispositions.  In 2002, we had a $1.8
million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions, compared with a net
gain of $4.8 million in 2001.

Our net interest expense
declined in 2002, partly due to the approximate $68 million of capital we
raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in June
of 2002.  We increased our effective
income tax rate to 30.8% in 2002, from 23.5% in 2001, primarily to reflect
additional taxes associated with our increased earnings.


Equity in losses of
associated companies reflects our share of operating results for TPI and for
our Mexican joint venture.  Amounts
included the following:

JBHT’s financial exposure
is limited to its approximate $8.5 million investment in TPI as we have not
made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of TPI’s financial
obligations.

The year 2001 financial
results of our Mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the
carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our
interests.  During the first quarter of
2002, we sold our joint venture interest in Mexico for its carrying value, to
the majority owner, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM).  We recorded an $18.1 million note receivable
from TMM, which, according to the terms of this sale, will be paid in four
annual payments of approximately $4.5 million, plus interest at 5% per annum,
through June of 2005.  The first payment
was received as scheduled in June of 2002.

2001 Compared With

Operating Segments

For Years Ended
December 31

(in millions of
dollars)

*As of December 31, 2000, TPI
qualified as a reportable business segment for financial reporting purposes.
However, the logistics segment (JBL) information for 2001 shown above excludes
TPI.  TPI is accounted for on the equity
method and does not qualify as a reporting segment in 2001.

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial
Statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report.

Overview of 2001

Financial and operating
results for the year 2001 were impacted by a number of significant items.  General economic conditions in the
transportation industry were soft during the majority of the year and fuel
costs varied dramatically, sometimes changing more than 10% from one month to
the next.  However, overall fuel costs
for 2001 were down from the prior year. 
Consolidated operating revenues for 2001 decreased approximately 3% from
2000.  Excluding the JBL operations,
which were contributed to TPI as of July 1, 2000, revenue growth for the
remaining business segments was approximately 6%.  The growth in the remaining segments is attributable to expansion
of our operating fleet of tractors from an average of 10,055 in 2000 to 10,710
in 2001, an average increase of 655 tractors or 6.5%.  While fuel costs and related fuel surcharge revenues varied
significantly during 2001, the net change in fuel surcharge revenue had less
than a 1% impact on revenue between 2001 and 2000.

JBT segment revenue
totaled $828.6 million in 2001, down 1% from 2000.  This decline was due in part to the softer economy that created a
reduced demand for freight.  JBT began
focusing on improving the operating ratio through cost management initiatives
rather than JBT fleet growth.  We had no
plans to grow the JBT fleet until such time that a reasonable operating income
had been achieved, warranting the additional investment of capital.  JBT tractor count,


including independent
contractors (I/C’s) declined nearly 3% during 2001 and tractor utilization was
also down approximately 3%.  However,
revenue per loaded mile increased 3.9%, excluding fuel surcharges, reflecting
freight mix changes and pure rate increases,. 
The Truck segment generated operating income of $8.7 million in 2001,
compared with a loss of $7.1 million in 2000. 
As a result of a new initiative commenced in late 2000, the number of
I/C’s in JBT grew to 337 in 2001, from 16 at the end of 2000.  Continued volatility in the earnings power
of the Truck unit is likely to prevail until supply and demand factors in the
truckload industry improve.  Additional
improvement is significantly dependent upon increases in the availability of
freight.

JBI segment business was
reasonably strong during 2001 and grew 9% to $740.5 million from $681.1 million
in 2000.  The Intermodal segment held
its tractor count essentially flat at 910 during 2001. Unlike the other
segments, growth of JBI is not easily tracked by number of tractors, as JBI can
utilize outside dray carriers and the other JBHT business units to support load
and revenue growth.  The increase in
revenue can be attributed to a 5% increase in the number of loads from 2000 to
2001, coupled with a 1.7% increase in revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharges.  As a result of revenue growth and
utilization of containers, JBI operating income climbed 15% in 2001 to $42.1
million from $36.7 million in 2000.

DCS segment revenue grew
15% during 2001, to $548.7 million from $478.6 million in 2000.  This growth rate was down significantly from
recent years due to:  1) soft economic
conditions which made companies more apprehensive about changing or outsourcing
their transportation needs, and;  2) our
unwillingness to reduce rates to increase market share.  The DCS segment tractor fleet grew by 15%
during 2001, but revenue growth was limited by idle tractors throughout most of
the year.  DCS generated $17.4 million
of operating income in 2001, compared with $28.4 million in 2000.  The lower margin and reduced operating
income was primarily a result of idle tractors and a higher proportionate
amount of shared trailer pool and corporate support costs being assigned to the
business, as a result of improving the tracking of trailer usage and the
increased internal transfer price, which is charged by JBT and JBI when DCS
utilizes their assigned trailers.  Cost
control and close analysis of individual fleet profitability remains a DCS
objective.

For the year ended
December 31, 2001, JBHT’s share of TPI’s results of operations totaled a loss
of $1.9 million, compared with earnings of $440,000 for the six month period
ended December 31, 2000.  TPI’s
operating loss in 2001 was primarily due to start up expenses.  JBHT’s financial exposure is limited to its
approximate $6.4 million investment in TPI as we have not made any additional
commitments or guaranteed any of TPI’s financial obligations.

The following table sets
forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of
operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as
compared with the prior year.


Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Total operating
expenses in 2001 declined 3.3% from 2000, decreasing in relative proportion to
operating revenues.  Our operating ratio
(operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues) improved
slightly to 96.6% in 2001 from 97.1% in 2000. 
As previously mentioned, the JBL segment was contributed to TPI
effective July 1, 2000.  This
approximate 10% reduction in consolidated operating revenues was the primary
factor in reduced rents and purchased transportation expense.  The JBI segment relied solely on JBT and
third party carriers for transportation services and accordingly, purchased
transportation costs as a percent of revenue were significantly higher than the
other segments.  The decline in fuel and
fuel tax expense was primarily due to significantly lower fuel cost per gallon
in late 2001.  The increase in 2001 operating
supplies and expenses reflected higher tractor and trailing equipment maintenance
and tire costs.  Insurance and claims
costs reflected higher collision rates in JBT during 2001.  The significant decline in general and
administrative expenses was due to an approximate $5.5 million gain on the sale
of a group of trailers, which closed in March of 2001.  Gains on revenue equipment dispositions are
included in this expense classification and totaled a net gain of $4.8 million
in 2001, compared with a loss of $267,000 in 2000.

Equity in earnings (loss)
of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for TPI and for
the Mexican joint venture.  Equity in
earnings amounts included the following:

The year 2001 financial
results of our Mexican joint venture primarily reflected adjustments to the
carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our
interests.  We had an agreement in
principle for a sale to the majority owner of the joint venture.  This transaction was consummated in early
2002.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Cash Flow

We generate significant
amounts of cash from operating activities. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $174 million in 2002, $172
million in 2001 and $125 million in 2000. 
While 2002 and 2001 reflected a typical level of cash provided by
operating activities, 2000 was impacted by a significant prepayment for an
operating lease which was funded in early 2000.  Cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect
additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment.  During the latter part of 2000 through late
2001, we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors.  Tractor additions since October 2001 have been purchased.  The majority of our trailing equipment
additions since October 2000 have been under operating lease programs.  Net cash provided by financing activities in
2002 reflects our $68 million secondary stock offering, which closed in June of
2002.  We discontinued a commercial
paper borrowing program during 2001 and ceased paying cash dividends in early
2000.

Liquidity

Our need for capital
typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to
support our growth and the replacement of older tractors and trailing equipment
with new, late model equipment.  We are
frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements
depending on market conditions.  We have
recently obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering, revolving
lines of credit and cash generated from operations.  We have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire
revenue equipment.

As mentioned above, we
utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late 2000 through late
2001.  We started purchasing tractors
and containers in October of 2001 and plan to continue purchasing tractors and
containers in the foreseeable future. 
We have been acquiring dry van trailing equipment since October of 2000,
primarily under operating lease programs. 
We currently expect to spend in the range of $220 million, net of
expected proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances, on revenue equipment for
the full calendar year of 2003.

We are authorized to
borrow up to $150 million under our current revolving lines of credit which
expire November 14, 2005.   We had no
balances outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2002.  Under the terms of our credit and note
agreements, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants including
leverage tests, minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all of the
financial covenants at December 31, 2002. 
As of December 31, 2002, we had committed to purchase approximately $184
million of revenue and service equipment, net of proceeds, from sale or
trade-in allowances.  We believe that
our current liquid assets, cash generated from operations and our revolving
lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital
requirements for the foreseeable future.

Risk Factors

In 1999, we entered into
a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our
Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately
$175 million.  These transactions used a
structure that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently indicated it
intends to examine.  We have voluntarily
disclosed these transactions to the IRS and in October of 2002, the IRS began
their examination of the specific facts of these transactions.  If the IRS challenges our transactions, we
intend to vigorously defend them. 
However, if the IRS successfully challenges these transactions, and is
successful in disallowing some or all of the tax benefits that we realized,
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and operating results.

Our effective income tax
rates were 30.8%, 23.5% and 15.0% for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.  We implemented an
accountable expense reimbursement plan for a portion of our drivers in February
of 2003 (driver per diem).  While this
plan will generally benefit both JBHT and the majority of our drivers, it
results in a higher effective income tax rate. 
Partly as a result of this change and anticipated higher earnings, we
are currently estimating an effective income tax rate of 37% to 39% for
calendar year 2003.

In 1997, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) commenced an action against us in
Federal District Court alleging that we had violated the Americans With
Disabilities Act by refusing to hire as truck drivers certain individuals who
were taking certain medications.  The
EEOC sought injunctive relief and damages for a group of 540 individuals.  The District Court dismissed the EEOC’s
complaint on our motion for summary judgment. 
The EEOC appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Appeals.  The Federal Court of Appeals upheld the
District Court’s decision in our favor. 
However, the EEOC may still appeal this case to higher courts.  If the higher courts rule against us, we
could be subject to a new trial in the District Court.

In a separate action
filed in Michigan in November 2001, by a group of eight former employees, the
plaintiffs alleged that we violated the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of Michigan.  In February 2003, we reached an agreement to
settle this complaint.  The terms of the
settlement are to remain confidential by agreement, however, this contemplated settlement
will not materially impact our financial statements or results of operations.

In October 2002, we were
assessed a judgment of approximately $7 million for an accident that occurred
in August 2001.  We are currently in
dispute over the total value of this judgment and plan to file the appropriate
appeals.  We believe, based on advise
from outside counsel, that it is probable that this award will be substantially
reduced by the appellate court. 
However, if we are unsuccessful in our appeal to the appellate court,
the ultimate payments to the claimant could have a material effect on our
financial statements.

Inflation could have a
material impact on our business.  A
prolonged or unusual period of rising costs could result in fuel, wages,
insurance, interest or other costs increasing rapidly and could adversely
affect our results of operations if we were unable to increase freight rates
accordingly.  The impact of inflation
has been minimal during the past three years.

Our business is subject
to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control,
any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.  These factors include
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel costs, excess capacity in
the trucking industry, surpluses in the market for used equipment, interest rates,
fuel taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance
levels and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers and
independent contractors.  We are also
affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business
cycles.

We operate in a highly
competitive and fragmented industry. 
Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current
profitability and to compete with other carriers.  We compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes,
some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources that we
do.  Some of our competitors
periodically reduce their freight rates to gain or retain business, especially
during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our
ability to maintain rates or maintain our profit margins.


We depend on third
parties in the operation of our business. 
Our Intermodal business segment utilizes a number of railroads in the
performance of transportation services. 
While the majority of these services are provided pursuant to written
agreements with the railroads, the inability to utilize one or more of these
railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

If we are unable to
retain our key employees, our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be harmed.  We are
highly dependent upon the services of a number of our officers and other key
employees.  We do not have employment agreements
with any of these employees.  The loss
of any of their services could have a materially adverse effect on our
operations or future profitability.

As part of a 1998 consent
decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a number of heavy-duty
diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their
engines which were produced subsequent to October 1, 2002.  We have not yet had sufficient time to test
these new engines.  We will continue to
test a limited number of the new EPA compliant engines.  In November of 2002, we committed to
purchase approximately 2,100 new tractors, primarily for our JBI and DCS
segments, which will be equipped with Mercedes engines.  These engines are not covered by the EPA’s
October 1, 2002 rules.  Except for these
2,100 tractors, which will be utilized primarily for local and regional
operations, we expect to limit new tractor purchases until we are able to
complete further testing and evaluation of the EPA compliant engines.  In addition, these new EPA compliant engines
are expected to increase the acquisition and operating costs of these tractors
and may negatively impact our future profitability.

Fuel and fuel taxes
currently represent our third largest general expense category.  During the past three years fuel cost per
gallon has varied significantly, with prices frequently changing as much as
$.10 to $.15 per gallon between consecutive months.  We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the
majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the
majority of higher fuel costs.  Most of
these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differences
between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed
to our customers.  In addition, we incur
additional costs when fuel prices rise which cannot be fully recovered due to
our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out-of-route miles
which cannot be billed to customers.  In
February of 2003, fuel prices averaged approximately 15% higher than December
of 2002 and 45% higher than February of 2002. 
Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material
adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2002, we had no
derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations

(SFAS No. 143).  SFAS No. 143 requires us to record the fair
value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which
we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or
normal use of the assets.  We also
record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life of the asset.  Subsequent to the initial measurement of the
asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each
period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash
flows underlying the obligation.  We
were required to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003.   The adoption of SFAS 143 will not have a
material effect on our financial statements.

In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34

.  This
Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued.   The Interpretation also
clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken.  The initial recognition and measurement
provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect
on our financial statements.  The
disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 2002, and are included in the notes to
our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition
and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

.  This Statement amends FASB Statement No.
123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of


Statement No. 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements.  Certain of the disclosure
modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and
are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM
7a.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings are affected
by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of
short-term debt. We from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate
the effects of interest rate changes; 
none were outstanding at December 31, 2002.  Risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near-term
adverse movement of 10% in short-term market interest rates.  If short-term market interest rates average
10% more during the next twelve months, there would be no material adverse
impact on our results of operations based on variable rate debt outstanding at
December 31, 2002.  At December 31,
2002, the fair value of our fixed rate long-term obligations approximated
carrying value.

Although we conduct
business in foreign countries, international operations are not material to our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Additionally, foreign currency transaction
gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2002.  Accordingly,
we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks
from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have
on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign
investment.  To date, we have not
entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other
derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

The price and
availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the
level of global oil production, seasonality, weather, and other market
factors.  Historically, we have been
able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the
form of fuel surcharges.  We cannot
predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future
or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such
increases.  As of December 31, 2002, we
had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

(1)

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Description
of Business

J. B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. (JBHT), together with our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a
diversified transportation services company operating under the jurisdiction of
the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state regulatory agencies.

(b)

Principles
of Consolidation and Critical Accounting Policies

JBHT’s consolidated
financial statements include our financial statements and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Our discussion and
analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated
financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and contained within this
report.  Certain amounts included in or
affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated,
requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions
which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are
prepared.  Therefore, the reported
amount of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated
disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily
affected by these estimates.  We
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience,
consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the
particular circumstances.  Nevertheless,
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.

However, we believe that
certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement
preparation process than others including determining the economic useful lives
of our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, exposures
under our self-insurance plans and various other recorded or disclosed
amounts.  To the extent that actual
outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause
us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected.

(c)

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the
statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

(d)

Tires
in Service

We capitalize tires
placed in service on new revenue equipment as a part of the equipment
cost.  Replacement tires and costs for
recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in service.

(e)

Property
and Equipment

Depreciation of property
and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of 3 to 15 years for revenue and service equipment, 10 to 40 years
for structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office
equipment.

Property and equipment
under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments
and amortized over the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term
or estimated useful life of the asset.


(f)

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue
based on relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses
recognized as incurred.

(g)

Income
Taxes

Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

(h)

Earnings
Per Share

A reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings per share is shown
below (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Options to purchase
shares of common stock that were outstanding during each year but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares
are shown in the table below.

(i)

Credit Risk

Financial instruments,
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist
primarily of trade receivables. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited due to our large number of customers and the diverse range of
industries which they represent.  As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had no significant concentrations of credit
risk.


(j)

Foreign Currency Translation

Local currencies are
generally considered the functional currencies outside the United States.  Assets and liabilities are translated at
year-end exchange rates for operations in local currency environments.  Income and expense items are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Foreign currency
translation adjustments, which reflect foreign currency exchange rate changes
applicable to the net assets of the Mexican operations have been recorded as a
separate item of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity
as of December 31, 2001.  This
investment was sold during 2002.

(k)

Stock
Based Compensation

We have adopted the
intrinsic value based method of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No.
25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in accounting for compensation costs for our stock
option plans.  Accordingly, compensation
expense is recognized on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying common stock at date of grant exceeds the exercise price.

Had we determined
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for our stock
options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(SFAS No. 123), our net earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below.

Pro forma net earnings
reflects only options granted since December 31, 1995.  Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation costs for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the
pro forma net earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is
reflected over the options’ vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation
cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1996 is not considered.

(l)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

We continually evaluate
the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in circumstances which
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceed the fair value of the assets. 
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell.

(m)

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income
consists of net earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments and is
presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

(n)

Claims
Accruals

Claims payable represent
accruals for the self-insured portion of pending accident liability, workers’
compensation, physical damage and cargo damage.  These accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the
nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims
development based on our past claims experience.

Our current insurance
coverage specifies that the self-insured limit on the majority of our claims is
$1.5 million, which is prefunded with our insurance carrier.  We are substantially self-insured for loss
of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.

(o)

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(SFAS No. 143).  SFAS No. 143 requires
us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in
the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement
of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the assets. 
We also record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life
of the asset.  Subsequent to the initial
measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation will be adjusted
at the


end of each period to
reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows
underlying the obligation.  We were
required to adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003.  The adoption of SFAS 143 will not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.

This Interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under guarantees issued.  The Interpretation also clarifies that a
guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken.  The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial
statements.  The disclosure requirements
are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending
after December 15, 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated
financial statements.

In December 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123.

This
Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,

to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation.  In
addition, this Statement amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No.
123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements.  Certain of the disclosure
modifications are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and
are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements.

(2)

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists
of (in thousands):

We are authorized to
issue up to $150 million under our current revolving lines of credit.  These lines of credit are supported by
credit agreements, with a group of banks, which expire November 14, 2005.  No balances were outstanding under these
lines of credit at December 31, 2002. 
The 7.80% senior subordinated notes are payable in five equal annual
installments of $10 million, which commenced October 30, 2000.

Under the terms of the
credit agreements and the note agreements, we are required to maintain certain
financial covenants including leverage tests, minimum tangible net worth levels
and other financial ratios.  We were in
compliance with all of the financial covenants at December 31, 2002.


Current maturities of
long-term debt at December 31, 2002 consist of the 6.25% senior notes and the
fourth installment of the 7.80% senior subordinated notes.  The aggregate annual maturities of long-term
debt for each of the two years ending December 31 are $97.0 million in 2003 and
$105.0 million in 2004.  There is no
long-term debt due in 2005.

(3)

Capital Stock

In late May and June of
2002, we closed an offering of approximately 5.9 million shares of common
stock.  Approximately 2.8 million shares
were issued and sold by JBHT and 3.1 million shares were sold by a
shareholder.  The selling price of the
stock was $26 per share before underwriter discounts and other expenses.

We maintain a Management
Incentive Plan (“Plan”) that provides various vehicles to compensate our key
employees with JBHT common stock or common stock equivalents.  Under the original Plan, we were authorized
to award, in aggregate, not more than 5,000,000 shares.  During 1998 and again in 2000, the
stockholders of JBHT amended the Plan whereby we are now authorized to award,
in aggregate, not more than 8,500,000 shares. 
At December 31, 2002, there were approximately 1,076,000 shares
available for grant under the Plan.  We
have utilized three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to purchase
JBHT common stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options and nonstatutory
stock options.  As of December 31, 2002,
there are no restricted stock awards or restricted options issued or
outstanding.

The Plan provides that
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the purchase of
JBHT common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
grant date.  The options generally vest
over a ten-year period and are forfeited if the employee terminates for any
reason.  The plan allows the employee to
surrender shares of common stock which the employee already owns in full or partial
payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy
withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  We amended certain vested options related to
employees of our logistics segment, extending the exercise period after
termination.  This resulted in a
remeasurement of these options and accordingly $110,000 was charged to
compensation expense in 2000.

A summary of the
restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase JBHT common stock follows:


During 1995, our Board of
Directors established a nonqualified stock option plan to provide performance
based compensation to the Chairman of the Board (Chairman’s Plan).  The Chairman’s Plan allowed the Chairman the
option to purchase up to 2.5 million shares of JBHT common stock at a price of
$17.63 per share.  These options vested
after five years.  The Chairman's Plan
allows the Chairman to surrender shares of common stock which he already owns
in full or partial payment of the option price of an option being exercised
and/or to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  Under the original Chairman’s Plan the
options were to be exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised
options would have terminated.  During
2000, our stockholders amended the Chairman’s Plan whereby the exercise period
was extended two years from date of vesting. 
One million options were exercised during the year ended
December 31, 2002 and 1.5 million options were exercised in 2001.  There were no options outstanding for the
Chairman’s Plan at December 31, 2002.

The per share weighted-average
fair value of stock options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $14.53,
$10.82 and $9.07, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 2002 -
expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 54.9%, risk-free interest rate of
3.2%, and an expected life of 6.7 years; 2001 - expected dividend yield 0.0%,
volatility of 59.9%, risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, and an expected life of
6.2 years; 2000 - expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 52.4%, risk-free
interest rate of 5.2%, and an expected life of 6.6 years.


The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002:

Income Taxes

Total income tax
(benefit) expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
allocated as follows (in thousands):

Refundable income taxes
at December 31, 2002 were $8,538,000 and payable income taxes at December 31,
2001 were $3,659,000.  These amounts
have been included in other current assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet, respectively.

Income tax expense
(benefit) attributable to earnings before income taxes consists of (in
thousands):


Income tax expense
attributable to earnings before income taxes differed from the amounts computed
using the statutory federal tax rate of 35% for the following reasons (in
thousands):

The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are
presented below (in thousands):


We believe our history of
profitability and taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and
our utilization of tax planning sufficiently supports the carrying amount of
the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly,
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as all deferred tax benefits are
more likely than not to be realized.

At December 31, 2002, we
had general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4,174,000
expiring from the year 2007 to 2009, and alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards with no expiration of approximately $12,863,000.

In 1999, we entered into
a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our
Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately
$175 million.  These transactions used a
structure that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently indicated it
intends to examine.  We have voluntarily
disclosed these transactions to the IRS and in October 2002, the IRS began
their examination of the specific facts of these transactions. If the IRS
challenges these transactions, we intend to vigorously defend them.  However, if the IRS successfully challenges
these transactions, and disallows some or all of the tax benefits that have
been realized, these actions could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and operating results.

(5)

Employee
Benefit Plans

We maintain a defined
contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a 401(k) option, under
which all employees are eligible to participate.  We match a specified percentage of employee contributions,
subject to certain limitations.  For the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, JBHT matching contributions to
the plan were $6,813,000, $7,555,000 and $6,553,000, respectively.

(6)

Fair Value of
Significant Financial Instruments

(a)

Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and Trade Accounts Payable

The carrying amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

(b)

Long-Term
Debt

The fair value of the
fixed rate debt is presented as the present value of future cash flows
discounted using our current borrowing rate for notes of comparable
maturity.  The calculation arrives at a
theoretical amount we would pay a creditworthy third party to assume our fixed
rate obligations and not the termination value of these obligations. Consistent
with market practices, such termination values may include various prepayment
and termination fees that we would contractually be required to pay if we
retired the debt early.

The estimated fair values
of our financial instruments are summarized as follows (in thousands):


(7)

Related Party
Transactions

We advanced premiums on
life insurance policies on the lives of our principal stockholder and his
wife.  In 2002, we ceased advancing
premiums on these policies.  All
premiums paid by JBHT, along with accrued interest thereon, are reimbursable
from a trust which is the owner and beneficiary of the policy.  We have a guarantee from the stockholder for
the amount of premiums paid by JBHT together with interest at the rate of 5%
per annum through June of 2000.  In July
of 2000 our Board of Directors approved an adjustment to the interest rate to
be our average borrowing rate when additional advances were made.  The interest rate changed to 7.42% in August
2001 and to 7.39% in July 2002.  The
amounts reimbursable to JBHT amount to approximately $10,153,000 and $9,049,000
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in other assets
in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  See also note 9 for disclosure of transactions with an associated
company.

(8)

Commitments and
Contingencies

During 1999, we entered
into a sale and leaseback transaction for a portion of our container
fleet.  Containers having a net book
value of approximately $175,000,000 were sold to third party leasing companies
at approximate net book value.  A gain
on the transaction has been deferred and will be amortized to income in
relation to rent expense recognized under the leases.  The containers are being leased back under operating leases over
terms of four to ten years.  We also
lease terminal facilities, shuttle yards and computer equipment under operating
leases having various terms.  Under the
terms of certain lease agreements, we are required to maintain certain
covenants including minimum credit ratings. 
We were in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2002.

During 2000, we entered
into various capital lease agreements to lease revenue equipment.  These capital leases are secured by revenue
equipment with a net book value at December 31, 2002 of approximately
$139,000,000 and contain certain guarantees of residual value at the end of the
lease terms with fixed price purchase options.

Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease
terms in excess of one year) and future minimum capital lease payments as of
December 31, 2002 are (in thousands):


At December 31, 2002 and
2001 gross property and equipment recorded under capital leases was
$193,953,000 and $194,256,000, respectively.

Total rent expense was
$115,084,000 in 2002, $98,783,000 in 2001, and $87,545,000 in 2000,
respectively.

At December 31, 2002, we
had committed to purchase approximately $184,000,000 of revenue and service
equipment net of expected proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances.

We adopted the provisions
of FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

.  The Interpretation requires that we recognize the fair value of
guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by JBHT after
December 31, 2002, if these arrangements are within the scope of that
Interpretation.  In addition, under
previously existing generally accepted accounting principles, we continue to
monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications
to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would
recognize any such losses under the guarantees and indemnifications when those
losses are estimable.

In 2002, we issued
financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our performance under
certain operating lease commitments and insurance policies.  If we default on our commitments under the
lease agreements or insurance policies, we are required to perform under these
guarantees.  The undiscounted maximum
amount of our obligation to make future payments in the event of defaults is
approximately $27 million.  As of
December 31, 2002, no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses under
the obligations, as it is probable that the suppliers will be able to make all
scheduled payments.

We are involved in
certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of
business.  Based on the present
knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we
believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of
operations.

Investment in
Affiliated Company

In March 2000, we, along
with five other motor carriers, announced the intent to contribute all of our
non-asset based logistics business into a recently formed joint venture,
Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  TPI is an
Internet-based global transportation logistics company.  TPI commenced operations effective July 1,
2000.  We contributed all of our
logistics segment business and all related intangible assets, plus $5.0 million
of cash, in exchange for an approximate 27% initial membership interest in
TPI.  We account for our approximate 27%
interest in TPI utilizing the equity method of accounting.  No gain or loss was recognized upon
formation and contribution of logistics segment assets to TPI.  Equity in earnings of TPI was a loss of
$1,353,000 in 2002.  On December 31,
2002, we acquired an additional 10% interest in TPI from one of the initial members.

We provided various
services to TPI under a shared service agreement, the terms of which expired on
December 31, 2002.  The services
included the following:  payroll and
benefits; accounting; computer system maintenance; office facilities; and telecommunications.  The fees from these services approximated
$6,299,000 and $6,483,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and were recorded in
the consolidated statement of earnings as reimbursements of salaries, wages and
employee benefits and general and administrative expenses.

We earned revenues of
$40,406,000 and $69,696,000 from TPI in providing transportation services
during 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At December 31, 2002 and
2001, trade accounts receivable included $2,383,000 and $4,198,000,
respectively, due from TPI for freight and fees related to the shared service
agreement.


For the years ending
December 31, 2002 and 2001, we incurred approximately $34,994,000 and
$32,649,000, respectively, in purchased transportation expense as a result of
TPI providing transportation services.

(10)

Segment
Information

We have three reportable
business segments, Truck (JBT), Intermodal (JBI), and Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS).  JBT business includes
full truck-load, dry-van freight which is typically transported utilizing company-owned
or controlled revenue equipment.  This
freight is typically transported over roads and highways and does not move by
rail.  The JBI segment includes freight
which is transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement and
also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI equipment or
third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to direct JBI
equipment back toward intermodal operations. 
DCS segment business typically includes company-owned revenue equipment
and employee drivers which are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or
service.  DCS operations usually include
formal, written long-term agreements or contracts which govern services
performed and applicable rates.

Prior to July 1, 2000,
the Logistics business segment primarily consisted of J. B. Hunt Logistics
(JBL) a wholly-owned subsidiary which provided a wide range of comprehensive
transportation and freight management services.  Such services included experienced professional managers,
information and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of
freight system solutions.  JBL utilized
JBT, JBI or DCS owned or controlled assets and employees, third-party carriers,
or a combination of these options to meet customer service requirements.  JBL services typically were provided in
accordance with written long-term agreements. 
As discussed in Note 9, we exchanged our ownership in JBL for an initial
membership interest in TPI.  Effective
July 1, 2000, we began accounting for our ownership in TPI utilizing the equity
method of accounting.  As of December
31, 2000, TPI qualified as a reportable business segment and, accordingly, the
Logistics segment information shown below includes both JBL and TPI.  Information for TPI included in the following
tables is the entity’s results of operations without regard to our ownership
interest which is then subtracted in reconciling to the consolidated statement
of earnings.

Our customers are
geographically dispersed across the United States and include many of the
“Fortune 500” companies.  One customer
accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 12% of consolidated operating revenues
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  A
summary of certain segment information is presented below (in millions):

addition, the CEO and CFO determined that there were no significant changes in
our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect our
internal controls subsequent to the date of their most recent evaluation.
