FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report, including documents which are incorporated by reference,
and other documents which we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), contains statements that may be considered to be “forward-looking
statements.”  Such statements relate to
our predictions concerning future events or operations and are within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Forward-looking statements are inherently
uncertain, subject to risks, and should be viewed with caution.  These statements are based on our belief or
interpretation of information currently available.  Stockholders and prospective investors are
cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from
these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Some of the factors and events that are not
within our control and that could have a material impact on future operating
results include:  general economic and
business conditions, competition and competitive rate fluctuations, cost and
availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and retain qualified drivers
and delivery personnel, a loss of one or more major customers, interference
with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads, insurance
costs and availability, claims expense, retention of key employees, terrorist
attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, new or different
environmental or other laws and regulations, increased costs for new revenue
equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of
revenue equipment manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for
guaranteed equipment trade-in values. 
Current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant
fluctuations of quarterly earnings.

You should understand that many
important factors, in addition to those listed above, could impact us
financially.  Our operating results may
fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described in
our filings with the SEC.  Some important
factors that could cause our actual results to differ from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements are described under “Risk Factors”
in Item 1A.  We assume no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement to the extent we become aware that it will
not be achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest surface transportation
companies in North America.  J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. is a publicly held holding company that, together
with our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies, provides a wide
range of transportation services to a diverse group of customers throughout the
continental United States, Canada and Mexico. 
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT”
refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated
subsidiaries.  We were incorporated in
Arkansas on August 10, 1961, and have been a publicly held company since
our initial public offering in 1983.  Our
wide scope of scalable service offerings is relatively uncommon in the industry
and ranges from full-load containerized freight transportation over highways
and railroads to individual deliveries to small businesses and personal
residences.  We have arrangements with
most of the major North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers
and trailers.  We also provide customized
freight movement, revenue equipment, labor and systems services that are
tailored to meet individual customer’s requirements and typically involve
longer-term contracts.  These
arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include
multiple pickups and drops, local and home deliveries, freight handling,
specialized equipment and network design. 
We also provide integrated capacity and comprehensive transportation and
logistics services and solutions by utilizing a network of thousands of
reliable third-party carriers.  While
these unrelated outside carriers, at times, supplement our dry-van, full-load
operations, they also provide flatbed, refrigerated, less-than-truckload (LTL)
and other specialized equipment, drivers and services.

Our business operations are primarily organized
through four distinct, but complementary, business segments.  These segments include intermodal (JBI),
dedicated contract services (DCS), full-load dry-van (JBT) and integrated
capacity solutions (ICS).  Our business
is somewhat seasonal, with slightly higher


Table
of Contents

freight volumes typically experienced during August through early
November.  Our DCS segment is subject to
less seasonal variation than our other segments.  For the calendar year ended December 31,
2008, our consolidated revenue totaled $3.7 billion, after the elimination of
intersegment business.  Of the total, 52%
was generated by our JBI business segment, 25% by DCS, 18% by JBT and 5% by
ICS.

Additional general information about us is available
from our Internet website at www.jbhunt.com. 
We make a number of reports and other information available free of
charge on our website, including our annual report on Form 10-K, our proxy
statement and our earnings releases.  Our
website also contains corporate governance guidelines, our code of ethics, our
whistleblower policy, Board committee charters and other corporate policies.

OUR MISSION AND STRATEGY

We
forge long-term partnerships with key customers that include supply-chain
management as an integral part of their strategy.  Working in concert, we drive out cost, add
value and function as an extension of our customers’ enterprise.  We believe that our operating strategy can
add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders.

RECENT FOCUS

Our
recent focus has been to maximize the return on our invested capital and to
generate free cash flow to reduce outstanding debt.  We continuously analyze where capital
expenditures yield the best return and allocate funds to those business units
and specific activities inside the business unit.  Unacceptable returns in various areas have
caused us to reduce certain of these business models or exit those activities
within the business model.  Our goal is
to become more asset-light in the services we provide, but to continue to grow
with new and existing customers by providing the most efficient transportation
solutions to their supply chains. 
Examples of steps taken to reach those goals include the continued
contraction of the JBT business unit coupled with the growth in our ICS
business unit, the expansion of our eastern intermodal network, the repayment
of approximately $280 million in outstanding debt in 2008, and the expansion of
our new customer base.  We also continue
to direct our dedicated business unit toward providing best-in-class service in
applications that require unique and specialized services ranging from retail
and small-business replenishment to deliveries at personal residences.

Increasingly, our customers are seeking energy-efficient
transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhouse-gas emissions.  Our intermodal service addresses both
demands.  We are customizing dedicated
solutions aimed at minimizing transportation-related carbon emissions.  Efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency are
ongoing, and we are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay

SM

Transport Partner.

As
always, we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to
conduct all of our operations as safely as possible.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Segment
information is also included in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

JBI Segment

The transportation service offerings of our JBI
segment utilize arrangements with most major North American rail carriers to
provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental
United States, Canada and Mexico.  Our
JBI segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with the former
Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway Company), a watershed event in the
industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers
in a joint marketing environment. 
Essentially, JBI draws on the intermodal (also known as “container on
flatcar”) services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its
equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at
the origin and destination rail terminal locations.  We provide the drayage service at either the
origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our company-owned tractors for the
majority of our intermodal loads, but utilize third parties where
economical.  Performing our own dray


Table

services keeps costs lower and improves customer service.  JBI provides seamless coordination of the
rail and dray movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for the
complete door-to-door service.

Our intermodal program has grown to more than 837,000
loads in 2008.  JBI operates 39,161
company-controlled containers systemwide. 
The entire fleet comprises 53-foot, high-cube containers and is designed
to take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior ride
quality.  JBI also manages a fleet of
2,124 company-owned tractors and 2,633 company drivers that provide efficiency
to our intermodal operations.  At December 31,
2008, the total JBI employee count was 2,913. 
Revenue for the JBI segment in 2008 was $1.95 billion, compared with
$1.65 billion in 2007.

DCS Segment

DCS offers transportation services that generally are
not provided by common truckload carriers or intermodal due to strict service
requirements, specialized equipment, and intense driver and delivery personnel
demands.  Our operations are managed on
site by transportation professionals who work in concert daily with the
customer and our drivers to ensure we deliver their product or service on time
in a safe and cost-effective manner.  All
operations are governed by longer-term contracts that typically include fixed
cost components related to dedicated specialized equipment and fuel surcharge
programs on round-trip miles.  These
contracts combined with our best-in-class execution allow DCS to retain its
customer base with consistent margins.

DCS revenue for 2008 was $927 million, compared with
$937 million in 2007.  At December 31,
2008 our segment operated 4,454 company-controlled trucks, 101 customer-owned
trucks, and 67 independent contractor trucks. 
The DCS segment employed 5,444 people at December 31, 2008.

JBT Segment

The service offering in this segment is full-load,
dry-van freight, utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways.  We typically pick up freight at the dock or
specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the
location of the consignee.  We use our
company-owned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who
agree to transport freight in our trailers.   
At December 31, 2008, we had 841 independent contractors operating
in the JBT segment, some of whom were leasing company-owned tractors.  JBT revenue for 2008 was $676 million,
compared with $842 million in 2007.  At December 31,
2008, the JBT segment operated 2,489 company-owned tractors and employed 3,030
people, 2,750 of whom were drivers.

In 2008, we entered into a plan to further reduce the
size of our JBT fleet and sell approximately 1,100 trailers.  This plan is consistent with our strategy as
an asset-light transportation company and our focus for growth and investment
in segments that provide the desired margins. 
We expect to sell or trade this equipment during calendar year 2009.

ICS Segment

ICS provides non-asset, asset-light, and
transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with
thousands of third-party carriers and integration with JBHT-owned
equipment.  By leveraging the JBHT brand,
systems and network, ICS brings a broader service offering to customers by
providing flatbed, refrigerated, expedited and LTL, as well as a variety of
dry-van and intermodal solutions.  ICS provides
single source logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their
transportation functions and utilize JBHT’s proven supply-chain, technology,
and design expertise to improve efficiency. 
ICS operates outside offices as well as on-site logistics personnel
working in direct contact with customers. 
ICS revenue for 2008 was $209 million, compared with $92 million in
2007.  At December 31, 2008, the ICS
segment employed 278 people.

Logistics Business and Affiliated
Company

We
own a 37% equity interest in a global transportation and logistics company,
Transplace, Inc. (TPI). TPI is co-owned by five large transportation
companies and provides a blend of logistics technology and



transportation management services. 
Our share of TPI’s financial results is included on a one-line
nonoperating item included on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings titled “equity
in loss of affiliated company.”

Marketing and Operations

We
transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of freight,
including general merchandise, food and beverages, forest and paper products,
building materials, chemicals and automotive parts.  Our customer base is extremely diverse and
includes a large number of Fortune 500 companies.  Our ability to offer multiple services,
utilizing our four business segments and a full complement of logistics
services through third parties, represents a competitive advantage.  We provide a broad range of transportation
services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core”
carriers.  We have no customers that
represent 10% or more of our total revenue in 2008.

We
generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and
marketing network.  We use a specific
sales force in DCS due to the length, complexity and specialization of the
sales cycle and ICS has its own proactive local branch salespeople.  In accordance with our typical arrangements,
we bill the customer for all services and we, in turn, pay all third parties
for their portion of transportation services provided.

People

We
believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our
service-oriented people.  As of December 31,
2008, we had 14,667 employees, including 10,022 company drivers, 1,197
mechanics and 3,448 office personnel.  We
also had arrangements with more than 900 independent contractors to transport
freight in our trailing equipment.  None
of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining
agreements.

Revenue Equipment

Our
JBI segment utilizes high-cube containers, which can be separated from the
chassis and double-stacked on rail cars. 
We continue the process of expanding our container fleet and
reconditioning our chassis fleet.  The
composition of our DCS trailing fleet also varies with specific customer
requirements and may include dry-vans, flatbeds, temperature-controlled, curtain-side
vans, straight trucks and dump trailers. 
Our JBT segment operates primarily with 53-foot dry-van trailers.  We continue to execute our strategy of
reducing the size of the JBT segment.  We
primarily utilize third-party carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our
ICS segment; however, certain loads will utilize third-party carriers’ tractors
powering our trailing equipment.

As
of December 31, 2008, our company-owned tractor and truck fleet consisted
of 9,067 units.  In addition, we had 912
independent contractors, who operate their own tractors, but transport freight
in our trailing equipment.  We operate
with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible, particularly in our
JBI and JBT fleets.  Based on our
customers’ preferences and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is
extremely diversified.  We believe
operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer
service, attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense.  At December 31, 2008, the average age of
our combined tractor fleet was 3.3 years, our containers averaged 5.3 years of
age and our trailers averaged 7.2 years. 
We perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment
at most of our regional terminal facilities.

Effective
with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA mandated lower emission standards for
newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. 
The 2007 EPA-compliant engines show a slight reduction in miles per
gallon and an increase in operating costs. 
Further, the acquisition costs of these new engines have increased by
approximately 10%.  A new set of more
stringent emissions standards will become effective for newly manufactured
tractor engines in January 2010.



Competition and the Industry

The
freight transportation market in which we operate is frequently referred to as
highly fragmented and competitive.  Our
JBI segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies as well as other
full-load carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation
service.  Considering the diversified
nature of the services provided by our DCS segment, competition ranges from
large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service
carriers.  Our ICS segment utilizes the
fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other non-asset-based
logistics companies and freight brokers, as well as full-load carriers.  The full-load freight competition of our JBT
segment includes thousands of carriers, many of which are very small.  While we compete with a number of smaller
carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent
competition in all markets across the country.

We
compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of
on-time pickup and delivery service, price, revenue equipment and availability
of carriers for logistics services.

Regulation

Our operations as a for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Administration (FMCSA), and certain business is also subject to state rules and
regulations.  The DOT periodically conducts
reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety
requirements, and we report certain accident and other information to the
DOT.  Our operations into and out of
Canada and Mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries.

In
November 2008, the FMCSA adopted final provisions of the Agency’s December 17,
2007, interim final rule concerning hours of service for commercial
vehicle drivers.  This final rule allows
drivers to continue to drive up to 11 hours within a 14-hour nonextendable
window from the start of the workday, following at least 10 consecutive hours
off duty.  The rule also allows
motor carriers and drivers to continue to restart calculations of weekly
on-duty limits after the driver has at least 34 consecutive hours off
duty.  The rule was effective January 19,
2009.  We continue to monitor the actions
of the FMCSA.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in this Form 10-K
and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk
factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business.  Our business, financial condition or
financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these
risks.

Our business is subject to general economic and business factors, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.  Recent economic trends and
the current tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect
our ability, and the ability of our suppliers, to obtain financing for
operations and capital expenditures.

Our
business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse
effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our
control.  These factors include
interference with, or termination of, our relationships with certain railroads,
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes,
interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, excess capacity in
the trucking industry, license and registration fees, terrorist attacks or
actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, increased costs for new
revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment, surpluses in the
market for used equipment, and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified
drivers and independent contractors.

We
are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’
business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries such as retail
and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions represent a greater
potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt
losses.  In addition, our results of
operations may be affected by seasonal factors. 
Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and



our
operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to
colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time
and higher maintenance costs.

We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.

Our
JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its
transportation services.  The majority of
these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the
railroads.  While we have agreements with
various Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern railways.  The inability to utilize one or more of these
railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating
results.  In addition, a portion of the
freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that
are subject to labor union contracts. 
Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
ICS business segment utilizes third-party carriers.  Aside from periodic use of our trailing
equipment to fulfill certain loads, we do not own or control the revenue
equipment or drivers delivering the loads. 
The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major
customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

For
the calendar year ended December 31, 2008, our top 10 customers, based on
revenue, accounted for approximately 35% of our revenue.  Our JBI, JBT and ICS segments typically do
not have long-term contracts with their customers.  While our DCS segment business may involve a
written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there
is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our
services or that they will continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our services
by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.

Ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our
earnings.

Our
future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which
could reduce our earnings.  During 2006
and 2007, the self-insured portion of our claims exposure for all claims was
$500,000 per occurrence.  During 2008,
the self-insured portion of our claims was $500,000 per occurrence for personal
injury and property damage and $1 million per occurrence for workers’
compensation.  If the number or severity
of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could
be adversely affected.  We have renewed
our policies for 2009 with substantially the same terms as our 2008
policies.  We purchase insurance coverage
for the amounts above which we are self-insured.  If these expenses increase, and we are unable
to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be
materially and adversely affected.

We operate in a regulated industry, and increased
direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of,
existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad
powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization
to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial
reporting.  We are audited periodically
by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety,
hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the
DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.

We
continue to monitor actions taken by the FMCSA. 
Significant changes in hours-of-service regulations and other motor
carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower
driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and
recordkeeping equipment.



Effective
with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA mandated lower emission standards for
newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. 
The acquisition costs of these new engines have increased by
approximately 10%.  A new set of more
stringent emissions standards will become effective for newly manufactured
tractor engines in January 2010. 
While it is too early to assess the impact of the new standards, our
fuel costs, operating costs and acquisition costs could be impacted.

Our operations are subject to various
environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in
substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to various environmental laws and
regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel
storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water.  We operate in industrial areas, where truck
terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or
other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel
spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among
others.  We also maintain bulk fuel
storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If a spill or other accident involving
hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of
applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business and operating results.  If we
should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be
subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our
periodic financial results.

During
the past several years, fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly.  We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in
place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to
recover the majority of higher fuel costs. 
Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost
of fuel.  However, there can be timing
differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel
surcharges billed to our customers.  In
addition, we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully
recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty
or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers.  Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of
fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future
profitability.  As of December 31,
2008, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to
fuel-price fluctuations.

Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers, delivery personnel and
third-party carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.

Periodically,
we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers,
including independent contractors.  If we
are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of employees or contract
with enough independent contractors, we could be required to significantly
increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle or
dispose of the equipment altogether, which could adversely affect our growth
and profitability.  In addition, our ICS
segment growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers
which we rely upon to provide transportation services.

We operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry.  Numerous factors could impair our ability to
maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and
private fleets.

We
compete with many other transportation services providers of varying sizes and,
to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more
equipment and greater capital resources than we do.  Additionally, some of our competitors
periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during
times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to
maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins.

In
an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects
so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in
some instances we may not be selected. 
Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their
shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the
loss of some business to competitors. 
Also, certain customers that



operate
private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their
operations, thereby reducing their need for our services.

Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt
our operations, impact freight volumes and increase our costs, all of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business results.

Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can
disrupt our operations.  Increases in
costs relating to towing and other maintenance frequently occur during the
winter months of our business.  Natural
disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and
increase our costs.

ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

Our
corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. 
We occupy a number of buildings in Lowell that we utilize for
administrative support, data center, primary customer service and freight
dispatch.  We maintain a backup data center
for disaster recovery, maintenance shop and driver operations facility in
Lowell.  We also own or lease
approximately 20 other significant facilities across the United States where we
perform maintenance on our equipment, provide bulk fuel and employ personnel to
support operations.  These facilities
vary from seven to 35 acres in size. 
Each of our business segments utilizes our larger facilities for
services including bulk fueling, maintenance and driver support
activities.  In addition to our principal
properties listed below, we lease a number of small offices and parking yards
throughout the country that support our customers’ business needs.

A
summary of our principal facilities in locations throughout the U.S. follows:

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal
conduct of business.  Based on present
knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we
believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

ITEM 5.   MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY,
RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is
traded in the over-the-counter market under the symbol “JBHT.”  At December 31, 2008, we were authorized
to issue up to 1 billion shares of our common stock and 167.1 million shares
were issued.  The high and low sales
prices of our common stock as reported by the National Association



of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations National Market system (NASDAQ) and the
quarterly dividends paid per share on our common shares were:

On February 20, 2009, the high and low sales prices for our common
stock as reported by the NASDAQ were $21.94 and $21.21, respectively, and we
had 1,345 stockholders of record.

Dividend
Policy

Our
dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors,
and payments are dependent upon our financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant.  In February 2009, we
announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.10 to $0.11, which
was paid February 26, 2009, to stockholders of record on February 12,
2009.  We currently intend to continue
paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. 
However, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.

Purchases
of Equity Securities

On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized the purchase of $500
million of our common stock over the next five years.  Purchases under that authorization were
completed in March 2007.  On May 2,
2007, our Board authorized up to $500 million in additional purchases of our
common stock over the next 12 months, which were completed by December 31,
2007.  There were no stock purchases
during calendar year 2008.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our results of operations and financial
condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes in Item 8.  This discussion
contains forward-looking statements. 
Please see “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a
discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these
statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying notes.  Therefore,
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated
disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing
basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and
other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.  Any
effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting
from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in
which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.  We consider our critical accounting policies
and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments
and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the
following:

Workers’ Compensation and
Accident Costs

We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to
employee injuries (workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and
cargo claims.  Most of our insurance
arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable
to each claim, but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to
catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured.  Our policies also include a contractual
premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of
48 months from each policy period inception. 
This contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert


Table
of Contents

the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any
further liability on those claims.  Our
estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors
as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur.

The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain
measurement dates and policy expiration dates. 
During 2006 and 2007, we were self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence
for personal injury, property damage and workers’ compensation.  For 2008, we were self-insured for $500,000
per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and $1 million for
workers’ compensation.  We have renewed
our policies for 2009 with substantially the same terms as our 2008 policies.

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a
liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and
severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims
administrators, as well as legal, economic and regulatory factors.  Our safety and claims personnel work directly
with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the
estimated cost of each claim.  The
ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding
the nature, timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available.  Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to
develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim
liability.  This process involves the use
of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and
includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above.  In doing so, the recorded liability considers
future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an
allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. 
We do not discount our estimated losses. 
At December 31, 2008, we had an accrual of approximately $18
million for estimated net claims.  In
addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly
premiums.  At December 31, 2008, we
had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $50 million, which represented
prefunded claims and premiums.  We are also
substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased
revenue equipment.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers and
trailers in connection with our business. 
This equipment may be purchased or acquired under operating lease
agreements.  In addition, we may rent
revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short-term
rental arrangements.  Revenue equipment
that is purchased is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  We periodically review the useful lives and
salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for
impairment.  See Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for
a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment.  We have not identified any impairment to our
remaining assets at December 31, 2008.

We have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or
trade-in values for certain new equipment. 
We have utilized these trade-in values, as well as other operational
information such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation
expense.  If our tractor supplier were
unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade-in values, it
could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight
transported and as other services are provided. 
Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the
customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based
on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been
completed at the end of the reporting period.

We record revenues on the gross basis at amounts
charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor, we are a principal
in the transaction, we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we
maintain discretion over pricing. 
Additionally, we are responsible for carrier selection with respect to
our ICS business.


Table
of Contents

Our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by
an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and
revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends
or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility.  The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed
quarterly.

Income Taxes

We
account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method in accordance
with current accounting standards.  Our
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable
income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded
the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings.  Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of
timing differences between when items are recognized in our Consolidated
Financial Statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax
returns.  We assess the likelihood that
deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  To the extent we believe recovery does not
meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance is established.
To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part
of our income tax provision.  We have not
recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2008, as all deferred tax
assets are more likely than not to be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining and
assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies
on our provision for income taxes.  As
part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether
the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being
sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position.  For tax positions that are more likely than
not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit
that is more likely than not of being sustained in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Such accruals require us to
make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from
these estimates.  Further, a number of
years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an
accrual, is audited and resolved.  See
Note 6, Income Taxes, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a
discussion of our current tax contingencies.

YEAR IN REVIEW

Significant
events for calendar year 2008 include:

·

Reported
seventh consecutive year of record revenues

·

Reduced
our total debt by approximately $280 million or 31%

·

Continued
strategy of transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily
asset-based truckload carrier to an asset-light transportation company

·

Designated
approximately 1,100 trailers in our JBT segment to be sold or traded in 2009 in
connection with our strategy to reduce the JBT segment fleet size to the
appropriate level

·

Increased
our quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share in January 2008 from $0.09 in
2007, and announced an increase to $0.11 per share effective February 2009

Our
2008 net earnings of $200.6 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, were down 6%
from the $213.1 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, earned in 2007.  A slowing freight environment and increased
fuel costs were our major challenges for 2008. 
Despite decreasing fuel prices in the second half of 2008, compared with
the first half, fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the
transportation industry during 2008.  Our
2008 fuel cost per gallon averaged 30% above 2007 levels.  However, due to our fuel surcharge programs,
we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs.

Freight
demand during 2008 was up for our JBI and ICS segments.  Demand for dry-van truck capacity was softer,
particularly during the fourth quarter 2008. 
Our JBI and ICS segments grew operating income by 6% and 146%,
respectively.  DCS showed a small decline
in operating income of 2%


Table
of Contents

while
JBT declined 96% from 2007.  In response
to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that
produce the greatest return on invested capital, we increased our JBI tractor
and container counts by 18% and 15%, respectively, as well as increased our DCS
trailer count by 11%.  We reduced our JBT
company-owned tractor fleet by 27%, excluding tractors designated as held for
sale.  We were able to effect some of
these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets.

Our 2008 consolidated operating ratio (operating expenses divided by
total operating revenues) was 90.4%, compared with 89.4% in 2007.  Our 2008 operating income reflected $3.9
million of pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for
sale.  Operating income in 2007 reflected
$8.4 million of pretax charges related to assets held for sale.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or
decrease of those items as compared with the prior year.

2008 Compared With 2007

Consolidated Operating
Revenues

Our total consolidated operating revenues rose to $3.7 billion in 2008,
a 6.9% increase over 2007.  Significantly
higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge (FSC) revenues of $730 million in
2008, compared with $480 million in 2007. 
This FSC revenue impacted our year-to-year comparison.  If FSC revenues were excluded from both
years, our 2008 revenue decreased less than 1% from 2007.  A 13.5% and 117.3% increase in 2008 JBI and
ICS load volume, respectively, contributed to our higher levels of
revenue.  The increases in revenue of our
JBI and ICS segments were partially offset by decreases in our DCS segment as a
result of decreased activity for delivery service accounts due to the overall
economic slowdown and weak housing market. 
Our JBT segment revenue decreased as a result of rate declines and
reduced tractor utilization, as a result of decreasing freight demand in the
JBT segment.


Table

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Our total 2008 consolidated operating expenses increased 8.1% over 2007
and offset the impact of the 6.9% increase in 2008 revenue over 2007 that
resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 90.4% from 89.4% in
2007.  Rents and purchased transportation
costs rose 19.7% in 2008, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads,
drayage companies and third-party carriers servicing ICS.  The total cost of salaries, wages and
employee benefits decreased 3.3% in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to decreases
in total driver pay.  This reduction in
total driver pay was primarily the result of a 24% decrease in the number of
drivers in the JBT segment.

Fuel and fuel taxes expense
increased 12.3% in 2008, primarily due to 29.7% higher fuel cost per gallon and
slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  We
have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers.  These programs typically involve a specified
computation based on the change in national, regional or local fuel
prices.  While these programs may
incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a
specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel
costs (e.g., $0.05 per gallon) to trigger an increase in fuel surcharge
revenue.  As a result, some of these
programs have a timing lag between when the cost is incurred and when it is
recovered.  This lag negatively impacts
operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively
impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly.

It is not meaningful to compare
the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue
between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel
expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in
our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. These
payments are classified as purchased transportation expense. While we are not
always able to recover all fuel cost increases, partly due to empty miles run
and engine-idling time, we are typically able to recover the majority of our
increased fuel costs.

Two additional factors
related to fuel costs and fuel surcharge revenue primarily impact JBT operating
income when fuel costs change rapidly. 
Some freight services incur empty miles and we may be unable to charge
fuel surcharge revenue on those miles. 
In addition, most systems and software applications utilized in the
truckload industry for measuring miles and billing revenue result in
computations that average 10% to 12% fewer miles than what is actually traveled
(hub miles). The combination of these two factors frequently results in no fuel
surcharge revenue billed for approximately 20% to 25% of the applicable miles
actually traveled.  During times of rapidly
changing fuel costs, operating income from these services can be significantly
impacted.

The 1.4% decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to
fewer tractors owned in our JBT and DCS segments.  Operating supplies and expenses rose 1.5% in
2008, primarily as a result of increased costs in airfare and travel
expenses.  Insurance and claims expense
decreased 12.8% due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs.  The 14.2% decrease in general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to a decrease in other driving expenses due to a
decrease in the number of drivers, and a decrease in the charge to write down
to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the 2007
write-down.  In addition, gains on asset
sales were $1.2 million in 2008 compared with losses on asset sales of $0.4
million in 2007.

Net interest expense for 2008 decreased by 18.9% compared with
2007.  This decrease was due to reduced
outstanding debt balances as well as reduced interest rates on our variable
rate debt.  Interest expense was further
reduced by a refund of interest previously paid to the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) from the 1999 tax case settlement and lower accrued interest on uncertain
tax positions.

Our effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2008 and 34.4% in 2007.  The increase in 2008 was primarily due to the
2007 rate being reduced by our 1999 tax case settlement in 2007.  See the section comparing 2007 with 2006
operating results for further details of this settlement.  We expect our effective income tax rate to
approximate 38% for calendar year 2009. The “equity in loss of affiliated
company” item on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of
the operating results of TPI.

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 18.1% to $1.95 billion in 2008, from $1.65
billion in 2007.  A significant portion
of this revenue growth was driven by a 13.5% increase in load volume.  The remaining portion of revenue growth was
primarily the result of a 4.1% increase in revenue per load, including fuel
surcharges, partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in the average length of haul.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose to $254 million in 2008, from
$239 million in 2007.  While increased
volumes contributed to higher operating margins, we were able to increase our
driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on third-party
equipment and drayage.  All of these
factors contributed to our operating income increasing by 6.3% in 2008.



DCS
Segment

DCS segment revenue declined 1.0% to $927 million in 2008, from $937
million in 2007.  This decrease in
revenue was primarily due to an 8.8% decrease in average length of haul and
lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet
size for their businesses.

Operating income decreased to $92 million in 2008, compared with $94
million in 2007.  This decrease in
operating income was due to decreased revenue and higher fuel and operating
costs.  These higher operating expenses,
relative to 2007, were offset by decreases in equipment rental costs and lower
insurance and claim costs.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined 19.6% to $676 million in 2008, from $842
million in 2007.  The decrease in revenue
was primarily the result of a 20.9% decrease in load count due to much softer
demand in 2008 than in 2007.

Operating income in our JBT segment declined to $1.4 million in 2008, from
$32 million in 2007, mainly due to reduced revenue and higher fuel costs.

ICS
Segment

ICS segment revenue grew 128.5% to $209 million in 2008, from $92
million in 2007.  This increase in
revenue was primarily due to a 117.3% increase in load volume from both new and
existing customers.

Operating income increased nearly 146% to $11 million in 2008, compared
with $4 million in 2007.  The large
revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses, including
higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the
ICS segment.  In 2008, we continued to
gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover
higher operating expenses.

2007 Compared With 2006

Consolidated Operating
Revenues

Our total consolidated operating revenues rose to $3.5 billion in 2007,
a 4.9% increase over 2006.  Significantly
higher fuel prices resulted in FSC revenues of $480 million in 2007, compared
with $430 million in 2006.  This FSC
revenue impacted our year-to-year comparison. 
If FSC revenues were excluded from both years, the increase of 2007
revenue over 2006 was 3.9%.  This
increased level of revenue, excluding FSC, was primarily the result of
increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity-management
actions and ICS business growth.  A 17.3%
and 148.4% increase in 2007 JBI and ICS load volume, respectively, contributed
to our higher levels of revenue.  The
increases in revenue of our JBI, DCS and ICS segments were partially offset by
decreases in our JBT segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet, rate
declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in
the JBT segment.

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Our total 2007 consolidated operating expenses increased 5.6% over
2006.  The combination of the 4.9%
increase in 2007 revenue over 2006 and this increase in operating expenses
resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 89.4% from 88.8% in
2006.  Rents and purchased transportation
costs rose 9.8% in 2007, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads,
drayage companies and third-party carriers servicing ICS.  This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain
trailing equipment off operating leases during 2007.  The total cost of salaries, wages and
employee benefits decreased less than 1% in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to
decreases in total driver pay.  This
reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 27% decrease in the
number of drivers in the JBT segment.


Table
of Contents

Fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 3.6% in 2007, primarily due to
6.9% higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  The 11.7% increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing equipment,
including new containers and chassis for our JBI segment, as well as trailers
purchased off operating leases. 
Operating supplies and expenses rose 6.9% in 2007, partly as a result of
higher revenue equipment maintenance, including tractors and trailing
equipment, as well as increased tire costs. 
The 45.1% increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily
related to the $8.4 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down
the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value, less costs to
sell.  This increase was also due to
losses on asset sales of $0.4 million in 2007 compared with gains on asset
sales of $2.9 million in 2006.

Our effective income tax rate was 34.4% in 2007 and 37.9% in 2006.  The decrease in our effective tax rate
compared with the prior-year rate is primarily the result of our settlement on
a proposed IRS adjustment, which resulted in a $12.1 million decrease of income
tax expense in the second quarter 2007. 
See Note 6, Income Taxes, for further information regarding this settlement.  The “equity in loss of affiliated company”
item on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of the
operating results of TPI.

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 15.6% to $1.65 billion in 2007, from $1.43
billion in 2006.  A significant portion
of this revenue growth was driven by a 17.3% increase in load volume.  The remaining portion of revenue growth was
primarily the result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue.  The increase was partially offset by a
decrease in revenue per load due to a 3.2% decrease in the average length of
haul from 2006.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose to $239 million in 2007, from
$182 million in 2006.  While increased
volumes contributed to higher operating margins, we were able to reduce the
number of empty truck miles in our pickup and delivery operations, increase our
driver productivity, and significantly reduce our reliance on third-party
equipment and drayage.  All of these
factors contributed to increasing our operating income by 31.4% in 2007.

DCS
Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 2.3% to $937 million in 2007, from $915
million in 2006.  This increase in
revenue was primarily due to a 1.4% increase in revenue per truck per week and
slightly higher load counts from customer demand.

Operating income decreased to $94 million in 2007, compared with $104
million in 2006.  The decrease in
operating income was primarily the result of an increase in driver
compensation, increases in fuel costs, and higher casualty and workers’
compensation costs in 2007 compared with 2006.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined 12.8% to $842 million in 2007, from $966
million in 2006.  The decrease in revenue
was primarily the result of a 9.1% decrease in load count, due to much softer
demand in 2007 compared with 2006.  An
approximate 2% decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue.

Operating income in our JBT segment declined to $32 million in 2007,
from $84 million in 2006.  In addition to
reduced revenue from lower load volume, operating expenses were higher in 2007,
compared with 2006, due to increases in tractor maintenance and tire
costs.  Also, we recorded an $8.4 million
pretax charge in December 2007 to write down the value of certain assets
held for sale.


Table
of Contents

ICS
Segment

ICS segment revenue grew 118.9% to $92 million in 2007, from $42
million in 2006.  This increase in
revenue was primarily due to a 148.4% increase in load volume from both new and
existing customers.

Operating income increased nearly 27.7% to $4 million in 2007, compared
with $3 million in 2006.  The large
revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses, including
higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the
ICS segment.  In the second half of 2007,
we were able to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that
began to cover higher operating expenses.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $505 million in 2008,
$458 million in 2007 and $423 million in 2006. 
The increase in 2008 cash provided by operating activities relative to
2007, after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as
depreciation, share-based compensation and impairment charges, was due
primarily to the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable
and trade accounts payable, as well as tax payments.

Cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflected additions
to and disposals from our fleet of revenue equipment.  The lower level of cash used in investing
activities during 2008 partly reflected our strategy of reduced investment in
the asset-based operations of our JBT segment.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2008 increased over 2007,
primarily due to repayments on our revolving lines of credit in 2008, compared
with cash provided by issuance of our senior notes and borrowings on our
revolving lines of credit in 2007.  Cash
provided by increased borrowings in 2007 was primarily used for company stock
purchases and capital expenditures.

Our
dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors and
payments are dependent upon our financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant.  We paid an $0.08 per share
quarterly dividend in 2006, a $0.09 per share quarterly dividend in 2007 and a
$0.10 per share quarterly dividend in 2008. 
In February 2009, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash
dividend from $0.10 to $0.11, effective with our payment in February 2009.  We currently intend to continue paying cash
dividends on a quarterly basis.  However,
no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.

Liquidity

Our
need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal
trailing equipment, trucks, tractors and dry-van trailers required to support
our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new, late-model equipment.  We are frequently able to accelerate or
postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market
conditions.  We have, during the past few
years, obtained capital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines
of credit and long-term debt issuances. 
We have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue
equipment.  To date, none of our
operating leases contains any residual value guarantees.

At
December 31, 2008, we were authorized to borrow up to a total of $425 million
under two different revolving lines of credit. 
The first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group
of banks for a total commitment amount of $350 million, which expires March 29,
2012.  The applicable interest rate under
this agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon the
specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and
our credit rating.  At December 31,
2008, we had $115.0 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 1.95%
under this agreement.

Our
second line of credit is an Accounts Receivable Securitization program with a
revolving-credit facility up to $75 million. 
This facility is secured by our accounts receivable, and we renewed this
facility at maturity on July 28, 2008, for a one-year term maturing on July 27,
2009.  The applicable interest rate under
this agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper rate in the market,
plus a margin based


Table

on
our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees.  At December 31, 2008, we had $50 million
outstanding at an average interest rate of 3.61% under this agreement.

In
March 2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31% Senior notes (2011 Notes), which
mature March 29, 2011, to various purchasers through a private placement
offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated March 15,
2007.  The proceeds were used for the
purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working
capital purposes.  The 2011 Notes were
issued at par value.  Interest payments
are due semiannually, in March and September of each year.

In
July 2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08% Senior notes (2014 Notes), which
mature July 26, 2014, to various purchasers through a private placement
offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated July 15,
2007.  Proceeds from these notes were used to purchase shares of our
common stock, pay down existing debt on our revolving-credit facilities and
finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment.  Principal payments in the amount of $50.0
million are due July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder
due upon maturity.  Interest payments are
due semiannually, in January and July of each year. The note purchase
agreements describe the terms and conditions of both notes, which include
requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.

In
September 2006, we entered into a $100 million term loan and credit
agreement in connection with our purchase of used, dry-van trailers.  This $100 million facility is collateralized
by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures September 29,
2009.  We are required to make minimum
quarterly principal payments in the amount of $3.5 million, through June 29,
2009, with the remainder due upon maturity. 
Stated interest on this facility is a three-month LIBOR variable
rate.  Concurrent with the loan and
credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of
5.85%.  The swap expires September 29,
2009, when the related term loan is due. 
At December 31, 2008, we had $68.5 million outstanding under this
term loan facility.

Our
revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain
covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all covenants
and financial ratios at December 31, 2008.

We
believe that our liquid assets, cash generated from operations and revolving
lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital
requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our
increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock.

We
are currently committed to spend approximately $140 million, net of proceeds
from sales or trade-ins during 2009, which is primarily related to tractors and
containers.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our
off-balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing
equipment and facilities.  As of December 31,
2008, we had less than $200,000 of obligations on the trailing equipment leases
and approximately $4.1 million on the facilities leases.


Table
of Contents

We
had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $11.3 million at December 31,
2008, that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2009, which are related to (1) our
self-insured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims,
and (2) our operating lease agreements. 
We plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our
third-party agreements.  The table above excludes $18.4 million
of liabilities under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes

, (FIN 48) as we are unable to reasonably estimate the
ultimate timing of settlement.  See
Note 6, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Fair Value Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(FAS 157) and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

(FAS 159).  See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for the
impact of these adoptions.

In
February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which delayed
the effective date of FAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis, until January 1, 2009.  We will adopt the provisions of FAS 157 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2009; however,
we are still evaluating the impact, if any, this will have on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for
That Asset is Not Active

, (FSP 157-3).  FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS
157 in cases where a market is not active. 
We have considered the guidance provided by FSP 157-3 in our
determination of estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and the
impact was not material.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Of our total $633.5 million of debt, we had $165.0 million of variable
rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2008, under our revolving lines of
credit.  The interest rates applicable to
these agreements are based on either the prime rate or LIBOR.  Our earnings would be affected by changes in
these short-term interest rates.  Risk
can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse
increase in short-term interest rates. 
At our current level of borrowing, a 1% increase in our applicable rate
would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately $1.7 million.  Our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate
debt, and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our
interest expense.  Periodically, we enter
into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates.

Although we conduct business in foreign countries, international
operations are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.  Additionally,
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Accordingly, we are not currently subject to
material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange
rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on
future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment.  To date, we have not entered into any foreign
currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments
to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations
due to changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather and
other market factors.  Historically, we
have been able to recover a majority of fuel-price increases from our customers
in the form of fuel surcharges.  We
cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the
future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such
increases.  As of December 31, 2008,
we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price
fluctuations.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.  In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

.  Based on our
assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2008, our internal control
over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

J.B.
Hunt Transport Services, Inc.

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related information appearing in this

maintaining controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that we collect
the information we are required to disclose in our reports to the SEC and to
process, summarize and disclose this information within the time periods
specified by the SEC.

Based on
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, and conducted by our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
believe that our controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are
able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed with the SEC within the required time periods.

We are
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders of

J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc.

We have
audited J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and
2007 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008 and our report dated February 25, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Business

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is one of the largest surface
transportation and delivery service companies in North America. We operate four
distinct, but complementary, business segments and provide a wide range of
general and specifically tailored freight and logistics services to our customers.
We generate revenues primarily from the actual movement of freight from
shippers to consignees, customized labor and delivery services, and from
serving as a logistics provider by offering or arranging for others to provide
the transportation service. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,”
“our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all of our wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these statements requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the amounts reported in
such statements and accompanying notes. We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and
using other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless,
our actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.

We believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more
significance in our financial statement preparation process than others. We
believe the most critical accounting policies and estimates include the
economic useful lives and salvage values of our assets, provisions for
uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of exposures under our insurance
and claims policies, and estimates for taxes. To the extent that actual, final
outcomes are different than our estimates, or that additional facts and
circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that
accounting period will be affected.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in
short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable Allowance

Our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by
an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments. The allowance
for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical
experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer
billing and account collectibility. The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed
quarterly. The allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments was
$5.2 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Inventory

Our inventories consist primarily of revenue equipment parts, tires, supplies
and fuel and are valued using the lower of average cost or market.


Table
of Contents

Investments in Marketable Equity Securities

Our investments consist of marketable equity securities stated at fair
value and are designated as either trading securities or available-for-sale
securities at the time of purchase based upon the intended holding period. Changes
in fair value of our trading securities are recognized currently in “general
and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions” in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. Changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale
securities are recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive income” on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless we determine that an unrealized loss is
other-than-temporary. If we determine that an unrealized loss is
other-than-temporary, we recognize the loss in earnings. Cost basis is determined
using average cost.

At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our investments classified
as available-for-sale securities was $1.9 million, compared with $8.8 million
at December 31, 2007. See Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans, for a discussion
of our trading securities.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 4 to 10 years for
tractors and 7 to 20 years for trailing equipment, 10 to 40 years for structures
and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office equipment. Salvage
values are typically 10% to 20% of original cost for tractors and trailing
equipment and reflect any agreements with tractor suppliers for residual or
trade-in values for certain new equipment. We capitalize tires placed in
service on new revenue equipment as a part of the equipment cost. Replacement
tires and costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are
placed in service. Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition of
equipment are recognized at the time of the disposition and are classified in
general and administrative expenses.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based on relative transit time
in each reporting period and as other services are provided, with expenses
recognized as incurred. Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will
be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each
reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service
that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.

Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-19,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent (EITF 99-19),
provides the criteria for recognizing revenue on a gross or net basis. Based on
the guidance in EITF 99-19, we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts
charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor, we are a principal
in the transaction, we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we
maintain discretion over pricing. Additionally, we are responsible for carrier
selection with respect to our ICS business.

Derivative Instruments

We account for derivatives in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

(FAS 133), as amended. We
periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in
interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document
relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative
transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. If it is determined that a
derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be
a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In
2006, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert a portion of
our variable rate debt to a fixed interest rate. This derivative instrument is
accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with FAS 133.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(FAS 109), as amended.


Table
of Contents

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the
enactment date. See Note 6, Income Taxes, regarding a change in our accounting
for uncertain tax positions beginning in 2007.

Earnings Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings available
to common stockholders by the actual weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if holders of options or unvested
restricted share units exercised or converted their holdings into common stock.
Outstanding stock options and unvested restricted share units represent the
dilutive effects on weighted average shares. A reconciliation of the number of
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is shown below
(in thousands):

Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding during
each year, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares, are shown in the table below.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk, include trade receivables. For the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for
approximately 35%, 38% and 40%, respectively, of our total revenue. Our top 10
customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 27% and 34% of our
total trade accounts receivable for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. One customer accounted for approximately 9%, 12% and 14% of
our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Each of our four business segments conducts business with this
customer.

Share-based Compensation

We have share-based compensation plans covering certain employees,
including officers and directors. Effective January 1, 2006, we accounted
for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-based
Payment

(FAS 123R). We currently are utilizing restricted share
units and nonstatutory stock options. Issuances of our stock upon share option
exercise or vested restricted share units are made from treasury stock. Our
restricted share unit awards include both graded-vesting and cliff-vesting
awards and therefore vest in increments during the requisite service period or
all at the end of the requisite service period as appropriate for each type of
vesting. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period
for the entire award.


Table
of Contents

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Assets Held for Sale

We continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or
changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell.

In December 2007, partly in response to changing market
conditions, we entered into a plan to sell approximately 700 tractors and 2,500
trailers within our JBT segment. Accordingly, we discontinued recording
depreciation expense on this revenue equipment effective January 1, 2008. We
reclassified the net book value from net property and equipment to assets held
for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2007, we
recorded a pretax charge of $8.4 million to reduce the carrying value of the
revenue equipment to estimated fair value, less cost to sell. Based on our
quarterly assessment to evaluate the carrying value of our assets held for
sale, we determined that a decline in the fair value of certain tractors held
for sale had occurred and accordingly recognized an impairment charge of $0.8
million in September 2008.

In December 2008, we entered into a plan to sell approximately
1,100 trailers within our JBT segment. We reclassified the net book value from
net property and equipment to assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and discontinued recording depreciation expense for these assets held
for sale. We recorded a pretax charge of $3.1 million to reduce the carrying
value of these assets to estimated fair value, less cost to sell. All
impairment charges are included in “general and administrative expenses, net of
asset dispositions” in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are recorded
in our JBT segment.

Claims Accruals

We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to
employee injuries (workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and
cargo claims. Most of our insurance arrangements include a level of
self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but provide an
umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are
completely insured. Our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment
factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each
policy period inception. This contractual adjustment factor is used to convert
the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further
liability on those claims. Our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes
these premium adjustment factors as part of the liability we recognize when the
accidents occur.

The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain
measurement dates and policy expiration dates. During 2006 and 2007, we were
self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury, property damage
and workers’ compensation. For 2008, we were self-insured for $500,000 per
occurrence for personal injury and property damage and $1 million for workers’
compensation.

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a
liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and
severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims
administrators, as well as legal, economic and regulatory factors. Our safety
and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance
companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate
cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the
nature, timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we
use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an
estimate of our ultimate claim liability. This process involves the use of
loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes
the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above. In doing so, the
recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully
insured status and provides an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. We
do not discount our estimated losses. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we
had an accrual of approximately $18 million and $19 million, respectively, for
estimated net claims. In addition, we are required to pay certain advanced
deposits and monthly premiums. At


Table
of Contents

December 31,
2008 and 2007, we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $50 million
and $49 million, respectively, which represented prefunded claims and premiums.
We are also substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and
leased revenue equipment.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

(FAS 157) and Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115

(FAS 159). See Note 10, Fair Value
Measurements, for the impact of these adoptions.

In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff
Position FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157

, which delayed the effective date of FAS 157
for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized
or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis,
until January 1, 2009. Accordingly, we have not applied FAS 157 to our
assets held for sale, which are recorded at estimated fair value, less cost to
sell. We will adopt the provisions of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities during the first quarter of 2009; however, we are still evaluating
the impact, if any, this will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position
FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset
When the Market for That Asset is Not Active

, (FSP 157-3). FSP 157-3
clarifies the application of FAS 157 in cases where a market is not active. We
have considered the guidance provided by FSP 157-3 in our determination of
estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and the impact was not
material.

Financing Arrangements

Our current financing arrangements consist of the following (in
millions):

Aggregate maturities of long-term debt subsequent to December 31,
2008, are as follows (in millions): 2009 - $118.5 (classified as current
portion of long-term debt); 2010 - $0.0; 2011 - $200.0; 2012 -
$165.0; 2013 - $50.0; and 2014 - $100.0.

Revolving Lines of Credit

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we were
authorized to borrow up to a total of $425 million and $575 million,
respectively, under two different revolving lines of credit. The first line of
credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total
commitment amount of $350 million, for both the 2008 and 2007 periods ended December 31,
which expires March 29, 2012. The applicable interest rate under this
agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon the
specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and
our credit rating. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $115.0 million
and $210.6 million outstanding, respectively, at an average interest rate of
1.95% and 5.84%, respectively, under this agreement.

Our second line of credit is an Accounts Receivable
Securitization program with a revolving credit facility up to $75 million at December 31,
2008 and $225 million at December 31, 2007. This facility is secured by
our accounts receivable, and we renewed this facility at maturity on July 28,
2008, for a one-year term maturing on July 27, 2009. The applicable
interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper
rate in the market, plus a margin based on our level of borrowing and


Table

commercial
paper dealer fees. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $50 million and
$220 million outstanding, respectively, at an average interest rate of 3.61%
and 5.32%, respectively, under this agreement.

Senior Notes

In March 2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31%
Senior notes (2011 Notes), which mature March 29, 2011, to various
purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase
agreement dated March 15, 2007. The proceeds were used for the purchase of
trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital
purposes. The 2011 Notes were issued at par value. All principal payments are
due upon maturity. Interest payments are due semiannually, in March and September of
each year.

In July 2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08%
Senior notes (2014 Notes), which mature July 26, 2014, to various
purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase
agreement dated July 15, 2007.  Proceeds from these notes were used
to purchase shares of our common stock, pay down existing debt on our revolving
credit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment. The
2014 Notes were issued at par value. Principal payments in the amount of $50.0
million are due July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder
due upon maturity. Interest payments are due semiannually, in January and July of
each year. The note purchase agreements describe the terms and conditions of
both notes, which include requirements to maintain certain covenants and
financial ratios.

Term Loan

In September 2006, we entered into a $100
million term loan and credit agreement in connection with our purchase of used,
dry-van trailers. This $100 million facility is collateralized by a security
interest in the trailing equipment and matures September 29, 2009. We are
required to make minimum quarterly principal payments in the amount of $3.5
million, through June 29, 2009, with the remainder due upon maturity. Stated
interest on this facility is a three-month LIBOR variable rate. Concurrent with
the loan and credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
to effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of 5.85%. The
swap expires September 29, 2009, when the related term loan is due. At December 31,
2008, we had $68.5 million outstanding under this term loan facility.

Our revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to
maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance
with all covenants and financial ratios at December 31, 2008.

4.

Capital Stock

We have one class of preferred stock and one class of common stock. We
had no outstanding shares of preferred stock at December 31, 2008 or 2007.
Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if
declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to one vote per share on
all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. At December 31, 2008,
we had 7.8 million shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise or
vesting of equity awards and 12.1 million shares reserved for future issuance
pursuant to share-based payment plans.

On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized the purchase of $500
million of our common stock over the next five years. Purchases under that
authorization were completed in March 2007. On May 2, 2007, our Board
authorized up to $500 million in additional purchases of our common stock over
the next 12 months, which were completed by December 31, 2007. There were
no purchases during 2008.

5.

Share-based
Compensation

We maintain a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that provides
various share-based financial vehicles to compensate our key employees with
shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents. Under the Plan, as
amended, we have, from time to time, utilized restricted share unit awards,
restricted options and nonstatutory stock options to compensate our employees and
directors. We currently are utilizing restricted share units and nonstatutory
stock options.



Our nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the
purchase of our common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common
stock at the grant date as awarded by the Compensation Committee. These options
generally vest over a 10-year period and are forfeited immediately if the
employee terminates for any reason other than death, disability or retirement
after age 55. An employee is allowed to surrender shares of common stock that
the employee has owned for at least six months in full or partial payment of
the option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy tax withholding
obligations incident to the exercise of an option. We did not grant any stock
options during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

We began awarding restricted share units in 2005.
These restricted share units have various vesting schedules ranging from three
to ten years when awarded. These restricted share units do not contain rights
to vote or receive dividends until the vesting date. Unvested restricted share
units are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason other than death,
disability or special circumstances as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Restricted shares are valued based on the fair value of the award on the grant
date, adjusted for dividend estimates based on grant date dividend rates.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004),

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123R) requires
the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements based
on the grant date fair value of those awards. In accordance with FAS 123R, this
cost will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to
provide service in exchange for the award. For awards outstanding as of January 1,
2006, FAS 123R required us to recognize future compensation expense for the
unvested portion of outstanding share-based payments based on the fair value of
the award on the grant date. It also required that the benefits associated with
tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be reported as a
financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We adopted FAS 123R,
effective January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and,
therefore, did not restate our prior-period results.

Share-based compensation expense is recorded in salaries, wages and
employee benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, along with other
compensation expenses to employees. The following table summarizes the
components of our share-based compensation program expense (in thousands):

A summary of our nonstatutory stock options and
restricted share units follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised
during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $41.7 million,
$40.4 million, and $35.3 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, we had $9.6 million and
$42.8 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated
forfeitures related to stock options and restricted share units, respectively,
that is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of
approximately 2.3 years for stock options and 2.2 years for restricted share
units.

Sheets.
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions
of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31,
2008 and 2007, are presented below (in thousands):

We believe that our history of profitability and taxable income, the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and our utilization of tax planning
sufficiently support the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly,
we have not recorded a valuation allowance, as all deferred tax benefits are
more likely than not to be realized.

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
treatment for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes recognition and
measurement guidance and requires that we assess whether the benefits of our
tax positions taken are more likely than not of being sustained under tax
audits.  We adopted the provisions of FIN 48, effective January 1,
2007.  Prior to adoption, we accounted for uncertain tax positions under
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,

Accounting
for Contingencies

(FAS 5), whereby we recorded liabilities
associated with tax uncertainties when the likelihood of occurrence was
probable and we were able to reasonably estimate the liability. As a result of
this adoption, we recognized an increase in noncurrent deferred tax assets of
$29.4 million and an increase in other long-term liabilities of $36.9 million,
with a corresponding reduction to beginning retained earnings of $7.5 million,
as of January 1, 2007.  We have not restated prior-period results. For
the year ended December 31, 2008, we have made adjustments to the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits that is a component of other long-term liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows (in millions):

In June 2007, we completed a Post Appeals
Mediation with the IRS, whereby we agreed to a settlement of a
sale-and-leaseback transaction and other uncertain tax positions related to the
IRS audits


Table
of Contents

for
tax years 1998-2003. As a result of this settlement, we made a cash payment to
the IRS for previous tax liabilities, including interest, in the amount of
$49.5 million. No penalties have been proposed or paid on these deficiencies. We
adjusted the amount of the accrued liability in excess of the net settlement
amount in June 2007, which resulted in a decrease in the income tax
expense of approximately $12.1 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had a total of $14.9
million in gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of this amount, $9.7 million
represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would
impact our effective tax rate.  Interest and penalties related to income
taxes are classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The amount of accrued interest and penalties during the year
ended December 31, 2008, was $1.5 million. Future changes to unrecognized
tax benefits will be recognized as income tax expense and interest expense, as
appropriate.  The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, was $3.5 million.

Only tax years 2004 and forward remain subject to examination by
federal tax jurisdictions, while tax years 1998 and forward remain open for
state jurisdictions.

7.

Employee
Benefit Plans

We
maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a 401(k) option,
under which all employees are eligible to participate. We match a specified
percentage of employee contributions, subject to certain limitations. For the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our matching contributions
to the plan were $8.5 million, $7.9 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible
employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Participants can elect to
defer up to a maximum of 50% of their base salary as well as up to 85% of their
bonus for the year. The compensation deferred under this plan is credited with
earnings or losses of investments elected by plan participants. Each
participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however,
these amounts are subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed
to the employee. A participant may elect to receive deferred amounts in one
payment or, if the balance is greater than $25,000, in quarterly installments
payable over a period of 3, 5, 10 or 15 years upon reaching age 55, having 15
years of service or becoming disabled. Our total liability under this plan was
$7.6 million as of December 31, 2008, and $9.7 million as of December 31,
2007. These amounts are included in other long-term liabilities in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participant withholdings are held by a trustee and
invested in equity securities as directed by participants. These investments
are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings. The
investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
totaled $7.6 million as of December 31, 2008, and $9.7 million as of December 31,
2007.

Derivative and
Financial Instruments

Interest rate swap

In
September 2006, we entered into an agreement to swap the variable rate on
our $100 million term loan and credit facility for a fixed 5.85% interest rate.
This interest rate swap effectively converts the floating rate debt to a fixed
rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future
interest expense. The swap expires September 29, 2009, when the related
term loan is due. The derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability of
cash flows to be paid related to the term loan and meets the required criteria
of a cash flow hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. Accordingly, changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects
earnings to the extent the derivative is effective in offsetting gains and
losses of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The ineffective portion
of gains and losses, if any, is recorded in current earnings through interest
expense. The fair value of the swap was a $1.9 and $1.6 million liability at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively, and is recorded in other accrued expenses in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair Value
Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, we adopted FAS 157. FAS 157, among other things, defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosure about such fair value measurements. Assets and liabilities measured
at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques stated in
FAS 157. The three valuation techniques are as follows:

FAS
157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a
market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for
evaluating such assumptions, FAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:


Table

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The
following are assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis at December 31, 2008:

Available
for sale investments are classified in prepaid expenses and other, trading
investments are classified in other assets and the interest rate swap is
classified in other accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adoption
of FAS 157 increased our disclosures regarding fair value measurements and did
not have an effect on our operating income or net earnings.

No
assets or liabilities were elected for fair value measurement under FAS 159,
and therefore adoption of FAS 159 had no impact on our financial statements.

Commitments and
Contingencies

As
of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $4.3 million of obligations
remaining under operating lease arrangements related to trailing equipment and
terminal facilities. None of our operating leases contains any residual value
guarantees. Under the terms of certain lease agreements, we are required to maintain
certain covenants, including minimum credit ratings. We were in compliance with
these requirements at December 31, 2008.

Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or
remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2008, are
approximately $4.3 million, with payment streams as follows (in thousands):
2009 - $2,080; 2010 - $1,066; 2011 - $873; 2012 - $242; and 2013 - $72.

Total
rent expense was $19.6 million in 2008, $29.2 million in 2007, and $78.8
million in 2006.

At
December 31, 2008, we had outstanding commitments to acquire approximately
$140 million of revenue equipment and facilities in 2009. This amount is net of
$94.5 million of expected sales proceeds from equipment dispositions.

During
2008, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our
performance under certain operating lease commitments and self-insurance
arrangements. If we default on our commitments under the lease agreements or
other arrangements, we are required to perform under these guarantees. The
undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make future payments in the
event of defaults is approximately $11.3 million.

We
are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal
conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of the facts and, in
certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of these
claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, our results of operations or our liquidity.

Affiliated
Company

We
have a 37% ownership interest in a logistics joint venture called Transplace, Inc.
(TPI). We routinely enter into transactions with TPI regarding the movement of
freight. Prior to January 1, 2007, we provided various services to TPI
under a shared-service agreement, primarily related to computer system
operations, services and maintenance. We earn transportation revenues and
purchase transportation services from TPI. We advanced $7.7 million to TPI in
the form of a note receivable during 2005, and in January 2009 the due
date on this note was extended to August 2011. In 2006, we reduced the
remainder of our original investment in the joint venture to zero as a result
of our equity in loss of TPI.

Since
2006 we have reduced the balance of the note receivable by the amount of our
equity in losses of TPI. This note receivable balance, including accrued
interest, was $2.6 million at December 31, 2008, after the reduction based
on our equity in loss of TPI, and carried an interest rate of 6.0%. This note
receivable from TPI is classified as other assets in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007. When the note is paid, any reduction
in the value of the note as a result of our portion of equity losses in TPI may
be recovered and recorded as a gain in the period collected. A summary of our
revenues and expenses related to TPI for the three-year periods ended December 31,
2008, and balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2008 and 2007, is
presented below (in millions):

Segment
Information

We
have four reportable business segments, Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS), Truck (JBT), and Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), which are
based primarily on the services each segment provides. The JBI segment includes
freight that is transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement
and also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI equipment or
third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to direct JBI
equipment back toward intermodal operations. DCS segment business typically
includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers assigned to a
specific customer, traffic lane or service. DCS operations usually include
formal, written longer-term agreements or contracts that govern services
performed and applicable rates. JBT business includes full-load dry-van freight
that is typically transported utilizing company-owned or company-controlled
revenue equipment. This freight is typically transported over roads and
highways and does not move by rail. ICS provides non-asset and asset-light
transportation solutions to customers through relationships with third-party
carriers and integration with JBHT-owned equipment. ICS services include
flatbed, refrigerated and LTL, as well as a variety of dry-van and intermodal
solutions. All transactions between reporting segments are eliminated in
consolidation.

Prior
to 2007, ICS financial results were reported as part of the JBT segment. Beginning
January 1, 2007, we began reporting ICS results separately. Prior-period
information has been restated to reflect ICS as a separate segment.

Our
customers are geographically dispersed across the United States. One customer
accounted for approximately 9%, 12% and 14% of consolidated operating revenues
in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A summary of certain segment information
as of December 31 is presented below (in millions):
