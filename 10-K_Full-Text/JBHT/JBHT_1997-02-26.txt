PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
GENERAL
     J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned
subsidiaries ("JBH" or the "Company") is a diversified transportation services
and logistics company operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of
Transportation, formerly the Interstate Commerce Commission ("ICC"), and various
state regulatory agencies. JBH is an Arkansas holding company incorporated on
August 10, 1961. Through its subsidiaries JBH transports primarily full-load
containerizable freight throughout the continental United States and portions of
Canada and Mexico. The Company also provides logistics and transportation-
related services which may utilize JBH equipment and employees, or may employ
equipment and services provided by unrelated third parties in the transportation
industry.
  JBH has various operating authorities granted by the ICC and state regulatory
agencies. The Company may transport any type of freight (except certain types of
explosives) from any point in the continental United States to any other point
in another state, over any route selected by the Company. The Company also has
certain intrastate authorities, allowing pick-up and delivery within those
states. Federal legislation was enacted effective January 1, 1995 which
preempted each state's right to limit entry into intrastate operations. JBH
transports a wide range of products including automotive parts, department store
merchandise, paper and paper products, plastics, chemicals and manufacturing
materials and supplies.
  JBH was granted certain Canadian authority initially in 1988 and currently
transports freight to and from all points in the continental United States to
Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario.  The Company has authorization to operate
directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date has served additional points
in Canada primarily through interchange operations with Canadian motor carriers.
The Company has provided transportation services to and from Mexico since 1989
through interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers. A joint
venture agreement with Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, the largest
transportation company in Mexico, was signed in 1992.
  In 1990, JBH initiated intermodal operations with the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway Company. In accordance with that agreement, freight could be
transported by rail utilizing traditional trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) or
container-on-flatcar (COFC) medium. Since this initial agreement with Santa Fe
(now Burlington Northern Sante Fe), intermodal operations have been expanded to
include arrangements with ten railroads. A number of these rail routes allow the
utilization of high cube containers which can be double-stacked to provide
improved productivity. Substantially all of the freight carried under these rail
arrangements is granted priority space on trains and receives preferential
loading and unloading at rail facilities. 
  The Company commenced offering transportation logistics services in 1992 in
response to shippers' interest in outsourcing their total distribution and
transportation processes.  JBH Logistics provides a range of comprehensive
transportation and management services including experienced professional
managers, information and optimization technology and the design or redesign
process of system solutions.  Dedicated contract services were initiated in
1993, which provide specifically assigned equipment, drivers and management to
companies that want to augment or outsource their private fleet.  During 1996,
the Company successfully exited the hazardous commodity and small package
transportation businesses in order to focus on the dry-van, logistics management
and dedicated equipment operations.

MARKETING AND OPERATIONS
  The truckload ("T/L") market has historically been a lower price, lower
service market when compared to the less-than-truckload ("LTL") segment. The
Company has opted to provide a premium service and charge compensating rates
rather than compete primarily on the basis of price.
  The Company's business is well diversified and no one customer accounted for
more than 5% of revenues during 1996 or 1995. Marketing efforts include
significant focus on the diversified group of "Fortune 500" customers. A broad
geographic dispersion and a good balance in the type of industries served allow
JBH some protection from major seasonal fluctuations. However, consistent with
the T/L industry in general, freight is typically stronger in the second half of
the year with peak months being August, September and October. In addition,
demand for services is usually strong at the end of the first two calendar
quarters (i.e., March and June). Revenue is also affected by bad weather and
holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of
shippers.

  The Company markets door-to-door T/L service through its nationwide 
marketing network. Services involving intermodal transportation mediums are 
billed by JBH and all inquiries, claims and other customer contact are 
handled by the Company. Certain marketing and sales functions are assigned to 
each of the primary businesses of dry-van, logistics management and dedicated 
equipment.  However, marketing strategy and national account service 
coordination is managed at the corporate level.

PERSONNEL
  At December 31, 1996, JBH employed 11,575 people, including 8,345 drivers.
The transportation industry and the Company have experienced shortages of
qualified drivers from time to time. The Company has developed an extensive
program to attract, train and retain drivers.   In September 1996, a new
compensation program was announced for the approximate 4,000 over-the-road van
drivers.  This comprehensive package, effective February 25, 1997, includes an
average 33 percent increase in wages for this group of employees.  The expected
results of this program include a more stable and experienced work force capable
of delivering a high quality of customer service.  Drivers are frequently
designated as local, regional, assigned/dedicated or over-the-road and typically
compensated on the basis of miles driven, a specific rate per week or a
combination of factors.  The Company also employed approximately 1,100 mechanics
at December 31, 1996.  Management believes that its relationship with all of its
employees is excellent.

REVENUE EQUIPMENT
  At December 31, 1996, JBH owned 7,750 tractors and operated 8,954 trailers
and 18,819 specially designed containers. The average age of the tractor and
trailing equipment fleet was slightly more than two and one half years.  In late
1992, the Company announced the development of a new multi-purpose container
which can be placed on a chassis for transportation over the road by truck and
also moved by rail or ship. The container and chassis combination may be
transported by rail (TOFC) or the container can be separated from the chassis
and double-stacked (COFC) on the rail for improved productivity.  In early 1996,
JBH took delivery of the remaining containers and chassis in its initial
equipment orders.  This rapid conversion of the van trailing fleet has helped
support the significant growth of intermodal volume.  Specific customer service
requirements are a primary determining factor of the dedicated equipment fleet
specifications and mix.

  A periodic maintenance program is strictly enforced for all revenue equipment
based upon the specific type and use of the equipment. JBH believes that modern,
late-model, clean equipment differentiates quality service in the marketplace. A
professional maintenance program minimizes downtime, increases utilization and
enhances the trade-in value of used equipment. 

COMPETITION
  JBH is the largest publicly held T/L carrier in the United States. It
competes primarily with other irregular route, T/L common carriers. LTL common
carriers and private carriers generally provide limited competition for T/L
carriers. JBH is one of a few carriers offering nationwide logistics management
and dedicated revenue equipment services. Although a number of carriers may
provide competition on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies
represent competition in all markets. The extensive rail network developed in
conjunction with the various railroads also allows the Company the opportunity
to differentiate its services in the marketplace.

REGULATION
  The Company is a motor common carrier regulated by the United States
Department of Transportation (formerly the ICC). The federal government
generally governs activities such as authority to engage in interstate motor
carrier operations, accounting systems, certain mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions and periodic financial reporting.
  Motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the
United States Department of Transportation (DOT) governing interstate operation.
Such matters as weight and dimensions of equipment and commercial driver's
licensing are also subject to federal and state regulations. A federal
requirement that all drivers obtain a commercial driver's license became
effective in April 1992. 
  The federal Motor Carrier Act of 1980 was the start of a program to increase
competition among motor carriers and limit the level of regulation in the
industry (sometimes referred to as "deregulation"). The Motor Carrier Act of


1980 enabled applicants to obtain ICC operating authority more easily and 
allowed interstate motor carriers, such as the Company, to change their rates 
by a certain percentage per year without ICC approval. The new law also allowed
for the removal of many route and commodity restrictions regarding the 
transportation of freight. As a result of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the 
Company was able to obtain unlimited authority to carry general commodities 
throughout the 48 contiguous states. Effective January 1, 1995, the federal 
government issued guidelines which allow motor carriers more flexibility in 
intrastate operations. Although this reduced level of state regulation may 
increase the level of competition in some regions, the Company believes it 
will ultimately benefit from this legislation.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

  The Company's corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. A 150,000-
square-foot building was constructed and occupied in September 1990. The
building is situated on a 127-acre tract of land.

  In addition to the corporate headquarters, the Company owns a separate 40-
acre tract in Lowell, Arkansas with three separate buildings totaling 21,000
square feet of office space and 90,000 square feet of maintenance and warehouse
space. These buildings serve as the Lowell operations terminal, tractor and
trailer maintenance facilities and additional administrative offices.  A new
terminal and maintenance facility was constructed and occupied in Chicago,
Illinois during 1996.

In addition to the above facilities, the Company leases several small offices
and trailer parking yards in various locations throughout the country.



ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   The Company is a party to routine litigation incidental to its business,
primarily involving claims for personal injury and property damage incurred in
the transportation of freight. The Company maintains excess insurance above its
self-insured levels which covers extraordinary liability resulting from such
claims. Adverse results in one or more of these cases would not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.


ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

   No matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 1996 to a vote of
security holders.

  *  Includes intermodal
  ** Reflects $32.2 million impact from sale of special commodities and 
     parcel management operations.

     The Company continued its strategy during 1996 and 1995 of providing 
diversified transportation and logistics management services, which utilize 
intermodal, professional management expertise and third-party revenue 
equipment.  This growth strategy allowed consolidated revenue to increase at 
double-digit rates, while the tractor fleet increased only 2% during 1996 and 
7% during 1995.  Dry van revenue, which includes intermodal operations, 
increased $79 million, or 8%, during 1996 and $26 million, or 3% during 1995. 
The relatively new service offerings of logistics management and dedicated 
contract significantly contributed to revenue growth in 1996 and 1995.  Dry 
van truck rates, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 2% during 
1996 and declined approximately 1% from 1994 to 1995.  Intermodal freight 
rates declined approximately 1% during 1996 and decreased approximately 3% 
from 1994 to 1995.  These rate decreases negatively impacted revenues and 
earnings in 1996 and 1995.

OPERATING EXPENSES
     Total operating expenses increased $95.5 million, or 7% from 1995 to 
1996. Total operating expenses, including special charges of $17.3 million, 
increased $208.2 million, or 19% in 1995.  Operating expenses as a percentage 
of operating revenues (operating ratio) were 95.9% in 1996 and 98.4% in 1995. 
The operating ratio for 1995 was 97.1% excluding special charges.  The 
following operating expense categories increased or decreased at percentage 
rates significantly different than the rate of revenue increase during the 
period indicated:

       1996 Compared to 1995
       ---------------------

     * Revenue increased 10%.
       
     * The 19% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the
       growth of logistics and dedicated contract business, which results in
       additional payments to railroads and third-party companies for
       transportation service.
       
     * Fuel and fuel taxes increased 12%, primarily due to significant increases
       in fuel cost per gallon.  This cost increase was partly offset by fuel
       surcharge revenue billed to customers.



     * The $5.3 million, or 4%, reduction in depreciation expense was due, in
       part, to gains on the sale of the special commodities and parcel
       management businesses.  Gains of $7.9 million before income taxes were
       recognized on the sale of these businesses and other assets and were
       offset against depreciation expense.  Gains on the sale of revenue
       equipment were $7.2 million in 1995.  Lower depreciation expense on
       certain revenue equipment and on-board tractor communication devices
       also reduced 1996 depreciation expense.
        
     * Significantly higher accident rates during the first half of 1996
       contributed to the 15% increase in insurance and claims costs.  A
       decision was announced in July 1996 to limit the speed of over-the-road
       tractors to 59 miles per hour.  Accident rates declined during late
       1996, partly due to lower speeds and additional management focus.
       
     * The significant decline in general and administrative expenses was
       primarily due to lower advertising costs.
       
     * Special charges of  $17.3 million were recorded in 1995 to reduce the
       carrying value of idle and under-performing assets.  No special charges
       were recorded in 1996.
       
     * The 25% increase in communication and utilities was primarily due to
       certain rate reductions and one-time credits recognized in early 1995.

       1995 COMPARED TO 1994
       ---------------------
     * Revenue increased 12%.
       
     * Salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 13%.  This increase was 
       due in part to a driver pay increase implemented in April 1995 for the
       Company's least experienced drivers.
       
     * Purchased transportation increased 26%, primarily due to the growth of
       logistics and dedicated contract business and resulting payments to
       railroads and third-party transportation companies.
       
     * The 18% increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to significant
       increases in the size of and upgrading the trailing equipment fleet, the
       addition of on-board tractor communication devices and lower equipment
       gains in 1995.  Gains on the disposition of revenue equipment, which are
       offset against depreciation expense, were $8.1 million in 1995 and $12.3
       million in 1994.
       
     * While the number of accidents did not increase significantly during 1995,
       a small number of severe accidents which fell within the Company's self-
       insured limits contributed to the significant increase in insurance and
       claims.
       
     * The significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due
       primarily to higher levels of spending for driver advertising and
       recruiting and recognition of certain uncollectible accounts receivable
       amounts.
       
     * Special charges of $17.3 million were recorded during the fourth quarter 
       of 1995 to reduce the carrying value of idle and under-performing assets.
       
     * The 15% increase in communications and utilities was primarily due to
       higher satellite usage charges in 1995 related to on-board tractor
       communication devices.
       
     * Interest expense increased by $5.0 million, primarily related to higher
       levels of debt associated with the acquisition of new containers and
       chassis.

     In September 1996, the Company announced a historic compensation package 
for its approximate 4,000 over-the-road van drivers.  This comprehensive 
plan, effective February 25, 1997, includes an average 33 percent increase in 
wages for this group of drivers.  The expected results of this program 
include a more stable and experienced work force capable of delivering a high 
quality of customer service.  Funding of this increased level of expense, 
estimated to approximate $50.0 million per year, is expected to result from 
shifting costs out of driver recruiting and training, safety, and from 
improved equipment utilization.  Both company-owned driver training centers 
were closed in October 1996, as an initial step to generate a portion of the 
planned cost savings. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   
     This discussion of corporate liquidity and capital resources should be 
read in conjunction with information presented in the Consolidated Statements 
of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

     The Company generates significant cash from operating activities and has 
substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating, committed and 
contemplated cash expenditures.

     Net cash provided by operating activities was  $143 million in 1996, 
$175 million in 1995, and $172 million in 1994. Trade accounts payable at 
December 31, 1995 included approximately $24 million due to revenue equipment 
suppliers for service equipment received in 1995, which funds were disbursed 
in early 1996.

     A commitment was made in 1992 to increase levels of capital spending and 
convert the majority of the dry van trailing equipment fleet to newly 
designed multi-purpose containers and chassis.  With nearly 19,000 of the new 
high cube containers in the fleet, the Company has taken delivery of all the 
units initially ordered.

     Net capital expenditures declined to $129 million in 1996, from $155 
million in 1995 and $219 million in 1994.  These exenditures were funded with 
proceeds from long-term debt and cash generated from operations.

December 31, 1996.  The Company filed a prospectus supplement with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in June 1995 to issue up to $150 million 
of senior or subordinated medium-term notes, of which $50 million of senior 
notes were outstanding at December 31, 1996.  In addition, the Company had 
approximately $128 million of uncommitted lines of credit, none of which were 
outstanding at December 31, 1996.  

     As of December 31, 1996, the Company had committed to purchase 
approximately $69 million of revenue and service equipment (net cost, after 
expected proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances of $21 million).

     In October 1996 the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up 
to 2.0 million shares of the Company's common stock, from time-to-time in the 
open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market 
prices. This was in addition to an authorization in October 1995 to 
repurchase up to 1.0 million shares.  During 1996, the Company purchased 
1,159,100 shares at market prices ranging from $14.13 per share to $16.63 per 
share.  During 1995, the Company repurchased 513,742 shares at market prices 
ranging from $13.125 per share to $15.625 per share.  During 1994, the 
Company repurchased 134,500 shares at market prices ranging from $15.125 per 
share to $15.75 per share.  The Company intends to hold these shares in 
treasury for general corporate purposes, which may include employee stock 
options and restricted stock awards.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
  Management is responsible for the financial statements and other information
contained in its annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with appropriate, generally accepted accounting principles, and the
other information presented is consistent with the financial statements. In
preparing these financial statements, it is necessary to make informed judgments
and estimates regarding the expected effects of certain events and transactions
that are currently being reported.
  To meet its financial reporting responsibilities, management depends upon
systems of internal controls which are intended to provide reasonable assurance,
in relationship to reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded, that
transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and that
the transactions are properly recorded so as to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management seeks to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of internal
accounting control are met by prudent selection of personnel, adoption of
appropriate policies, effective communication to personnel and establishment of
an effective system of authorization.
  The Board of Directors performs an oversight role with respect to
management's financial reporting responsibilities. To ensure effective discharge
of its responsibilities, the Board of Directors has established an audit
committee. The majority of the committee members are nonemployees of the Company
and its subsidiaries. The audit committee has met and reviewed accounting
issues, financial reporting and audit matters, including those pertaining to the
effectiveness of the Company's systems of internal control.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG Peat Marwick
LLP. As part of their audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements,
our independent accountants considered the Company's system of internal control
structure to the extent they deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing
and extent of their audit tests. These auditing procedures are intended to
provide a reasonable level of assurance that the consolidated financial
statements are fairly stated in all material respects.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,  stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1996. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

                      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                           December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994


(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its 
      wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Company"), is a diversified 
      transportation services and logistics company operating under the 
      jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation and various 
      state regulatory agencies.
  
      (a) USE OF ESTIMATES

        Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
          relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
          of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the consolidated
          financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
          principles.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
  
      (b) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

        The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
          Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant 
          intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in 
          consolidation.
      
      (c) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

        For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
          highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three
          months or less to be cash equivalents.
      
      (d) TIRES IN SERVICE 

        The Company capitalizes tires placed in service on new revenue equipment
          as a part of the equipment cost.  Replacement tires and costs for
          recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in
          service.
      
      (e) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

        Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-
          line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 - 10 years for 
          revenue and service equipment, 10 to 40 years for structures and 
          improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office equipment. 
          Gains on dispositions of revenue and other equipment, which are 
          offset against depreciation expense, were approximately $7,949,000, 
          $7,181,000 and $12,251,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 
          1995 and 1994, respectively.
        
      (f) REVENUE RECOGNITION

        The Company recognizes revenue based on relative transit time in each
          reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.


                                                                  (Continued)

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


  (g) INCOME TAXES
      Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. 
        Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
        consequences attributable to differences between the financial
        statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
        respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
        using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
        years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
        or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
        change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
        the enactment date.
      
  (h) EARNINGS PER SHARE
      Earnings per share have been computed based on the weighted average
        number of shares outstanding during each year (37,913,331 in 1996;
        38,520,323 in 1995; and 38,559,528 in 1994).  Shares issuable under
        employee stock options are excluded from the weighted average number of
        shares as their dilutive effect is less than 3%.
      
  (i) CREDIT RISK
      Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
        concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. 
        Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
        limited due to the Company's large number of customers and the diverse
        range of industries which they represent.  As of December 31, 1996, the
        Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
      
  (j) DERIVATIVES
      The differential paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is
        accrued as interest rates change and is charged or credited to interest
        expense over the life of the agreements.  Any gains or losses realized
        upon the termination of an interest rate swap agreement are deferred
        and amortized over the remaining life of the original term as a charge
        or credit to interest expense.
      
      The differential paid or received on fuel swap agreements is accrued as
        fuel prices change and is charged or credited to fuel expense on a
        monthly basis.
      
  (k) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
      Local currencies are generally considered the functional currencies
        outside the United States.  Assets and liabilities are translated at
        year-end exchange rates for operations in local currency environments. 
        Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange
        prevailing during the year.  Cumulative translation adjustments, which
        reflect foreign currency exchange rate changes applicable to Mexican
        operations, are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity and
        reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $5,621,000 and $6,739,000
        at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

                                                                  (Continued)

                     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


  (l) MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN
      Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its management
        incentive plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
        Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO
        EMPLOYEES, and related interpretations.  As such, compensation expense
        would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price
        of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price.  On January 1,
        1996, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED
        COMPENSATION, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the
        vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of
        grant or alternatively to continue to apply the provisions of APB
        Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net earnings and pro forma
        earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in
        1995 and future years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS
        No. 123 had been applied.  The Company has elected to continue to apply
        the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma
        disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123.
      
  (m) SPECIAL CHARGES
      The Company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its assets for
        events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying
        value may not be recoverable.  As part of this reevaluation, the
        Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use
        of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If the sum of the expected
        future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
        than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
        through a charge to earnings.

                        J. B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. 
                                  AND SUBSIDIARIES

                     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


  Under its commercial paper note program, the Company is authorized to issue
    up to $250 million in notes.  These notes are supported by two credit
    agreements, which aggregate $250 million, with a group of banks, of which
    $125 million expires March 27, 1997 and $125 million expires March 31,
    1999.  The effective rate on the commercial note program was 6.18% and
    6.11% for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
  
  The 6.25% senior notes are payable at maturity on September 1, 2003; the
    7.75% senior notes are payable in annual installments of $5,000,000 on
    October 31; the 7.84% senior notes are payable in annual installments of
    $5,000,000 on March 31; the 7.80% senior subordinated notes are payable in
    five equal annual installments beginning October 30, 2000; the 6.25% senior
    notes are payable at maturity on November 17, 2000; and the 6.00% senior
    notes are payable at maturity on December 12, 2000.
  
  Under the terms of the credit agreements and the note agreements, the Company
    is required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage
    tests, minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios.
  
  The Company has approximately $128 million of uncommitted lines of credit,
    none of which were outstanding at December 31, 1996. These lines are with
    various domestic and international banks and are due on demand.  Interest
    on borrowings is generally tied to the banks' prevailing base rates or
    other alternative market rates.  No commitment or facility fees are paid on
    these lines of credit and the obligations are typically evidenced by
    unsecured demand notes.
  
  Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 1996 consist of
    outstanding commercial paper associated with the revolving credit agreement
    which expires March 27, 1997 and one installment of the senior notes.  The
    aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the five years
    ending December 31 are as follows (in thousands): 1997, $49,750; 1998,
    $5,000; 1999, $130,000; 2000, $60,000; and 2001, $10,000.
  
(3) CAPITAL STOCK
    The Company maintains a Management Incentive Plan ("Plan") that provides
      various vehicles to compensate key employees with Company common stock. 
      Under the Plan, the Company is authorized to award, in aggregate, not more
      than 5,000,000 shares.  At December 31, 1996 there were approximately
      221,000 shares available for granting under the Plan.  The Company has
      utilized three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to purchase
      the Company's common stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options 
      and nonstatutory stock options.
    
    Restricted stock awards are granted to key employees subject to restrictions
      regarding transferability and assignment.  Shares of Company common stock
      are issued to the key employees and held by the Company until each 
      employee becomes vested in the award. Vesting of the awards generally 
      occurs over a four year period of time from the award date. Termination of
      the employee for any reason other than death, disability or certain cases 
      of retirement causes the unvested portion of the award to be forfeited.
  
                                                                     (Continued)





                        J. B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. 
                                   AND SUBSIDIARIES

                     Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
  
  
  Key employees have been granted restricted options to purchase stock.  The
    option price is 50% of the fair market value of the stock at the date of
    grant.  Vesting of the award generally occurs over a four year period
    beginning on the grant date.  Failure to exercise a vested option within
    210 days after vesting or termination of the employee for any reason other
    than death or disability will cause unexercised and nonvested options to be
    forfeited.
  
  The Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key
    employees for the purchase of Company common stock for 100% of the fair
    market value at the grant date.  The options generally vest over a ten year
    period and are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason. 
  
  Compensation expense under the Plan is charged to earnings over the vesting
    period and amounted to approximately $628,000, $1,100,000 and $1,600,000
    for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
  
  A summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase Company
    common stock follows:

                                                                       Number

During 1995, the Board of Directors established a nonqualified stock option
  plan to provide performance based compensation to the Chairman of the
  Board.  The plan allows the Chairman the option to purchase up to 2.5
  million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $17.63 per
  share.  These options are exercisable after five years, except for special
  circumstances in which the options vest earlier.  The options must be
  exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised options will
  terminate. 

                                                                  (Continued)

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



  Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the
    grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's net
    earnings (loss) would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
    below.
  
                                                       1996        1995
                                                       ----        ----
     Net earnings (loss)            As reported     $ 22,115     (2,170)
                                    Pro forma         19,180     (2,820)

     Earnings (loss) per share      As reported     $    .58       (.06)
                                    Pro Forma            .51       (.07)
  
  Pro forma net earnings (loss) reflects only options granted in 1996 and 1995. 
    Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation costs for stock
    options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net earnings
    (loss) amounts presented above because compensation cost is reflected over
    the options' vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation cost for
    options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.
  
  The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


     The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at
December 31, 1996 and 1995 are presented below (in thousands):

                                                               1996       1995

     Deferred tax assets:
       Claims accruals, principally due to accrual
        for financial reporting purposes                    $(16,288)   (17,834)
       Tax credit carryforwards                               (9,193)   (17,896)
       Accounts receivable, principally due to
        allowance for doubtful accounts                       (5,410)    (4,353)
       Special charges, principally due to write-off
        for financial reporting purposes                         -       (5,670)
       Other                                                  (4,489)    (4,673)
                                                            --------    -------
         Total gross deferred tax assets                     (35,380)   (50,426)
                                                            --------    -------
     Deferred tax liabilities:
       Plant and equipment, principally due to
        differences in depreciation and
        capitalized interest                                 153,303    153,176
       Prepaid permits and insurance, principally
        due to write-offs for income tax purposes              6,709      5,653
       Other                                                   6,527      4,155
                                                            --------    -------
         Total gross deferred tax liabilities                166,539    162,984
                                                            --------    -------
         Net deferred tax liability                         $131,159    112,558
                                                            --------    -------
                                                            --------    -------

     The Company believes its history of profitability and taxable income, 
its taxes paid within the three year carryback period and its utilization of 
tax planning sufficiently supports the value of the deferred tax assets. 
Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance on its books 
as all deferred tax assets are more than likely to be recovered.

     The Company had general business tax credit carryforwards of 
approximately $2,621,000 expiring from the year 2007 to 2009, and alternative 
minimum tax credit carryforwards with no expiration of approximately 
$6,572,000 at December 31, 1996.

(5) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company maintains a defined contribution employee retirement plan, 
which includes a 401(k) option, under which employees are eligible to 
participate after they complete one year of service.  Company contributions 
to the plan each year are made at the discretionary amount determined by the 
Company's Board of Directors.  For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 
and 1994, total Company contributions to the plan, including matching 401(k) 
contributions, were $3,450,000, $3,394,000 and $1,950,000, respectively.

                                                                   (Continued)

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(6) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
    CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE ACCOUNTS
      PAYABLE
    The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity 
      of these instruments.

    LONG-TERM DEBT
    The carrying amount of the commercial paper debt approximates the fair 
      value because of the short maturity of the commercial paper instruments.

    The fair value of the fixed rate debt is presented as the present value 
      of future cash flows discounted using the Company's current borrowing 
      rate for notes of comparable maturity.  The calculation arrives at a 
      theoretical amount the Company would pay a creditworthy third party to 
      assume its fixed rate obligations and not the termination value of these
      obligations.  Consistent with market practices, such termination values 
      may include various prepayment and termination fees that the Company 
      would contractually be required to pay if it retired the debt early.

    INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS
    The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are obtained from dealer
      quotes.  These values represent the estimated amount the Company would 
      pay to terminate such agreements, taking into consideration current 
      interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties.

    The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are
      summarized as follows (in thousands):



                                                                    (Continued)

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


(7) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    The Company advances premiums on life insurance policies on the lives of 
      the Company's principal stockholder and his wife.  All premiums paid by 
      the Company, along with accrued interest thereon, are reimbursable from 
      a trust which is the owner and beneficiary of the policy.  The Company 
      has a guarantee from the stockholder for the amount of premiums paid by 
      the Company together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum.  The 
      amounts reimbursable to the Company amount to approximately $4,630,000 
      and $4,468,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  These 
      amounts are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.

(8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    The Company has committed to purchase approximately $69 million of revenue
      and service equipment (net cost, after expected proceeds from sale or
      trade-in allowances of $21 million).

    The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising 
      from the normal conduct of business.  Based on the present knowledge of 
      the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management
      believes the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a
      material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.
  
(9) QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
    During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded special charges of
      approximately $17,296,000 to reduce the carrying value of idle and under-
      performing assets, primarily property and equipment and inventories
      associated with the auto hauling operations.  The effect of these charges
      reduced net earnings for the fourth quarter and for the year by
      approximately $10,896,000 ($.29 per share).

    Operating results (unaudited) by quarter for the years ended December 31,
      1996 and 1995 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):



                                                                  (Continued)
