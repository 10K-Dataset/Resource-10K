FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report, including documents which are incorporated by reference,
and other documents which we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), contains statements that may be considered to be “forward-looking
statements.”  Such statements relate to
our predictions concerning future events or operations and are within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are inherently
uncertain, subject to risks, and should be viewed with caution. These
statements are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently
available. Stockholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual
results and future events may differ materially from the forward-looking
statements as a result of many factors. Some of the factors and events that are
not within our control and that could have a material impact on future
operating results include:  general
economic and business conditions, competition and competitive rate
fluctuations, cost and availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and
retain qualified drivers, a loss of one or more major customers, interference
with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads, insurance
costs and  availability, claims expense,
retention of key employees, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse
weather conditions, new or different environmental or other laws and
regulations, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the
value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to
perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade-in values.
Current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant
fluctuations of quarterly earnings.

You should understand that many important factors, in addition to those
listed above, could impact us financially. Our operating results may fluctuate
as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described in our
filings with the SEC. Some important factors that could cause our actual
results to differ from estimates or projections contained in the
forward-looking statements are described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. We
assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to the extent we
become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest surface transportation companies in North
America. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT) is a publicly held holding
company that, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries and associated
companies, provides a wide range of transportation services to a diverse group
of customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and Mexico. We
were incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1961, and have been a publicly held
company since our initial public offering in 1983. Our service offerings
include transportation of full truckload containerizable freight, which we
directly transport utilizing our company-controlled revenue equipment and
company drivers or independent contractors. This full truckload freight may be
transported entirely by truck over roads and highways, or may be moved, in
part, by rail. We have arrangements with most of the major North American rail
carriers to transport truckload freight in containers and trailers. We also
provide customized freight movement, revenue equipment, labor and systems
services that are tailored to meet individual customers’ requirements and
typically involve long-term contracts. These arrangements are known as
dedicated services and may include multiple pickups and drops, home deliveries,
freight handling, specialized equipment and network design. We also have a 37%
ownership interest in a global transportation logistics company, Transplace,
Inc. (TPI). TPI is co-owned by five large transportation companies and provides
supplemental sales, management and freight movement services through
arrangements with a large number of common carriers.

Our business operations are primarily organized through three distinct,
but complementary, business segments. These segments include full truckload
dry-van (JBT), intermodal (JBI) and dedicated contract services (DCS). In
addition, we operated a logistics business segment from 1992 until mid-2000. In
2000, we, along with a number of other publicly held transportation companies,


contributed
our existing logistics business to a new, commonly owned company, Transplace,
Inc. (TPI). Our business is somewhat seasonal with slightly higher freight
volumes typically experienced during the months of August through early
November. Our DCS segment is subject to less seasonal variation than our JBT
and JBI segments. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2005, our
consolidated revenue totaled $3.13 billion, after the elimination of
inter-segment business. Of the total, $1.28 billion, or 41%, was generated by
our JBI business segment. Our JBT segment generated $1.02 billion, or 32%, of
total revenue and DCS represented $844 million, or 27%.

Additional general
information about us is available from our Internet website at www.jbhunt.com.
We make a number of reports and other information available free of charge on
our website including our annual report on Form 10-K, our proxy statement and
our earnings releases. Our website also contains corporate governance
guidelines, our code of ethics, our whistleblower policy, committee charters
for our Board of Directors and other corporate policies.

OUR MISSION AND STRATEGY

We forge long-term partnerships with key customers that include
supply-chain management as an integral part of their strategy. Working in
concert, we drive out cost, add value and function as an extension of our
customers’ enterprise. We believe that our operating strategy can add value to
customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders.

RECENT FOCUS

During the past five years, we have taken significant steps to
re-establish a primary focus on the profitability of our three business
segments. In each segment we have implemented capacity management decision making
processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they
will generate more profit. We continually focus on replacing less-profitable
freight with higher-margin freight and lanes. Selective pricing actions and
ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas
of major focus. We have also worked to ingrain safety into our corporate
culture, which has reduced our accident and injury costs during the past several
years.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Segment information is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

JBT
Segment

Our primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment
include full truckload, dry-van freight, which is predominantly transported
utilizing company-controlled tractors operating over roads and highways. We
pick up our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and
transport the load directly to the location of the consignee. Most of our loads
are transported entirely by our company-owned tractors and employee drivers, or
by independent contractors (ICs) who agree to transport freight in our trailers.
We also assign freight to be handled by third-party motor carriers other than
ICs. This type of freight movement typically results in our billing the
customer for all applicable freight charges and, in turn, paying the third
party for their portion of the transportation services provided. This type of
service usually results in our recognition of revenue for the entire billing
and the payment to the third-party being classified as purchased transportation
expense.

We operate utilizing certain Canadian authorities, allowing us to
transport freight to and from all points in the continental United States to
Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. We have authorization to operate directly
in all the Canadian provinces, but to date we have served limited points in
Canada, primarily through interchange operations with Canadian motor carriers. In
late 2000, we began utilizing ICs in the JBT segment and at December 31, 2005,
we had 1,142 ICs operating in the JBT segment. JBT revenue for calendar year
2005 was $1.02 billion, compared with $928 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005,
the JBT segment operated 4,368 company-controlled tractors and employed 5,882


people,
4,895 of whom were drivers. A portion of our JBT segment non-driver employees
provide freight solicitation, order entry and other operational support
services to our other two segments. We record inter-segment credits and charges
to properly reflect these inter-segment support services.

JBI
Segment

The transportation service offerings of our JBI segment utilize arrangements
with most major North American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight
solutions for our customers throughout the continental United States, Canada
and Mexico. Our JBI segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership
with the former Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway Company), a watershed
event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and
truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment. Essentially, JBI draws on
the intermodal (also known as “container on flatcar”) services of rail carriers
for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups
and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at the origin and destination rail
terminal locations. We may directly provide the drayage service at either the
origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our company-controlled tractors, or
we may purchase these services from third parties. JBI provides seamless
coordination of the rail and over-the-road transport movements for our
customers and delivers a single billing for the complete door-to-door service.

Our intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to nearly 600,000
in 2005. JBI operates 23,755 company-controlled containers systemwide. The
entire fleet is comprised of 53-foot, high-cube containers and is designed to
take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior ride quality. JBI
also manages a fleet of 1,341 company-owned tractors and 1,719 company drivers
in support of intermodal operations. We also began utilizing ICs in our
intermodal segment during 2005. We had 16 ICs operating in our JBI business segment
at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the total JBI employee count was 1,951,
including the 1,719 drivers. Revenue for the JBI segment in calendar year 2005
was $1.28 billion, compared with $1.12 billion in 2004. As previously
announced, an arbitration process with the BNSF Railway Company (BNI) was concluded
during the third quarter of 2005. In accordance with the settlement terms, we
paid BNI $25.8 million in the third quarter of 2005. Normal commercial business
activity continued between the parties during the approximate 15-month
arbitration process, and normal business operations have continued since the
final settlement.

DCS
Segment

Since 1992, we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service
option. DCS segment operations specialize in the design, development and
execution of customer-specific fleet solutions. Capitalizing on advanced
systems and technologies, DCS offers transportation engineering solutions that
support private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation and transportation
system augmentation. DCS operations typically provide customized services that
are governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry-van, flatbed,
temperature-controlled, dump trailers and local inner-city operations.

DCS operations focus on delivering recognizable customer value through
best-in-class service, cost control and guaranteed dedicated capacity. DCS
utilizes a proprietary methodology known as Customer Value Delivery™ (CVD) to
create, measure and communicate value created for each customer. DCS leverages
the JBHT freight network to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles,
thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost. DCS also frequently
finds synergy in shared resources with the JBT and JBI segments, including
terminals, drivers, maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations and trailer pools
providing further economies of scale. DCS revenue for calendar year 2005 was $844
million, compared with $760 million in 2004. In early 2004, we began utilizing
ICs in the DCS segment and at December 31, 2005, we had 152 ICs operating in
the DCS segment. At December 31, 2005, the DCS segment operated 4,771 company-controlled
and 87 customer-owned tractors, and employed 5,834 people, 5,144 of whom were
drivers.


Logistics
Business and Associated Company

We officially began offering transportation logistics services in 1992
through a wholly owned subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics, Inc. (JBL). JBL
services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a
substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation process to
one organization. The JBL segment business included a wide range of comprehensive
transportation and management services, including experienced professional
managers, information and optimization technology, and the actual design or
redesign of system solutions. A new logistics customer or service arrangement
frequently required a significant amount of up-front analysis and design time,
during which alternatives were considered and custom systems and software were
developed. Effective July 1, 2000, we contributed our existing JBL segment
business to a newly formed company, TPI. TPI provides supplemental logistics
sales and management support and also has arrangements with approximately 2,800
motor carriers to provide capacity to transport freight. Our share of TPI’s
financial results are included on a one-line, non-operating item included on
our Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated
company.”

Operations in Mexico

We have provided transportation services to and from Mexico since 1989.
These services typically involve equipment interchange operations with various
Mexican motor carriers. As previously reported, we sold a joint venture
interest with a Mexican transportation company in 2002. We received all
remaining funds due in connection with this sale during 2005. This transaction
had no significant impact on our earnings. We continue to provide
transportation services to and from Mexico primarily by utilizing the services
of a variety of Mexican carriers.

Marketing
and Operations

We transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of
freight, including forest and paper products, building materials, general
merchandise, food and beverages, chemicals and automotive parts. Our customer
base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of Fortune 500 companies.
Our ability to offer multiple services, utilizing our three business segments
and a full complement of logistics services through third parties, represents a
competitive advantage. We provide a broad range of transportation services to
larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers. Our
largest customer in 2005 was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for
approximately 15% of our total revenue.

We
generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and
marketing network. We do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the
business-unit level, particularly for our DCS segment. In accordance with our
typical arrangements, we bill the customer for all services and we, in turn,
pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided. In
recent years, we have re-established a primary focus on improving the
profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for
all services provided.

People

We believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our
competitors is our service-oriented people. As of December 31, 2005, we had
approximately 16,370 employees, including 11,758 company drivers. We also had
arrangements with 1,310 ICs to transport freight in our trailing equipment. In
addition, we employed 1,170 mechanics and 3,439 office personnel at the end of
2005. None of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective
bargaining agreements.

Our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and
retaining enough qualified truck drivers. It is also common for the driver
turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100%. It has been our practice
during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an above-average level
in order to attract a higher caliber of experience and minimize turnover. During
2005, we increased company driver and IC compensation in order to attract and
retain an adequate supply of qualified drivers. While we have not, to date,
experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages, we
expect


the
costs to recruit, train and retain company drivers and ICs will continue to
rise in the foreseeable future.

Revenue
Equipment

As of December 31, 2005, we operated 10,480 company-controlled tractors.
In addition, our 1,310 ICs operate their own tractors, but transport freight in
our trailing equipment. We operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets
as possible, particularly in our JBT and JBI fleets. Based on our customers’ preferences
and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is more diversified. We
believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better
customer service, attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense. At
December 31, 2005, the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 2.2 years,
our trailers averaged 5.0 years of age and our containers averaged 6.8 years. We
perform routine servicing and preventative maintenance of our equipment at most
of our regional terminal facilities.

We typically operate newer revenue equipment in our JBT segment to
minimize downtime and maximize utilization. Our JBI segment utilizes high-cube
containers, which can be separated from the chassis and double-stacked on rail
cars. We are currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and
reconditioning our chassis fleet. The composition of our DCS trailing fleet
varies with specific customer requirements and may include dry-vans, flatbeds,
temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, and even straight or dump trucks.

Effective October 1, 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
required that most newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines comply with
certain new emission standards. We initially limited our new tractor purchases
while we tested these new 2002 EPA-compliant engines. At December 31, 2005, we
were operating approximately 5,900 tractors with these 2002 rule-compliant
engines. These engines experience an approximate 4% to 5% lower fuel efficiency
and are also expected to require higher annual maintenance costs.

Effective with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated even
lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. We
once again are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these new
standards, but allow adequate testing of the new engines. The 2007 EPA-compliant
engines will be equipped with a particulate trap and will require more costly
ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. The EPA estimates that ULSD fuel will cost
approximately $.04 to $.05 more per gallon. We are unable at this time to
determine the increase in acquisition and operating costs of these new 2007
EPA-compliant engines.

Competition
and the Industry

According to the most recently available study conducted by the American
Trucking Associations (ATA), all modes of domestic freight carriers in the
United States generated approximately $610 billion of revenue in 2003. Of this
total, truck transportation represented about 87%, or $531 billion. ATA also
estimated that approximately 54% of the nation’s 2003 truck revenue related to
for-hire carriers, while 46% related to private carriers. As of July 2004,
there were more than 573,000 private, for-hire, U.S. Mail and other U.S.
interstate motor carriers on file with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration (FMCSA). The top 10 for-hire truckload carriers only generate
about 3% of the total revenue in this segment, and we represent approximately
1% of this segment’s revenue. The market in which we compete is frequently
referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers, many of
which are very small. While we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a
regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent competition in all
markets across the country. We compete with other freight transportation
carriers primarily in terms of on-time pickup and delivery service,
availability of drivers, and revenue equipment and price.

Regulation

Our operations as a for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Administration, and certain business is also subject to state rules and
regulations. The DOT periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our


compliance
with all federal safety requirements, and we report certain accident and other
information to the DOT. Our operations into and out of Canada and Mexico are
also subject to regulation by those countries.

Effective October 1, 2005, driver hours-of-service regulations (HOS)
were revised. The majority of these rule changes had initially been effective
January 4, 2004. These collective changes were the most significant changes to
driver HOS in more than 40 years. In general, the new rules require a driver to
take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a ten-hour
off-duty period. These new rules primarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop
freight operations and had a minor negative impact on our overall operations and
financial results.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in
this Form 10-K and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the
following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our
business. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be
materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Also note that
additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively
impact our business or financial results.

Our business
is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our
control, any of which could have a material adverse effect

on our results of
operations.

Our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a
material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are
beyond our control. These factors include significant increases or rapid
fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry, surpluses
in the market for used equipment, interest rates, fuel taxes, license and
registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, and difficulty in
attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors.

We are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in
customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries such
as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of
customers. Economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we
may be required to increase our reserve for bad-debt losses. In addition, our
results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to
reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses
tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather, which
causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance
costs.

We
operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry. Numerous factors
could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete
with other carriers and private fleets.

Some of these factors include:

•

We compete with many other truckload carriers
of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers and
railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than
we do.

•

Some of our competitors periodically reduce
their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth
rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase
freight rates or maintain our profit margins.

•

Many customers reduce the number of carriers
they use by selecting so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation
service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.


•

Many customers periodically accept bids from
multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress
freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.

•

Certain of our customers that operate private
fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations.

•

The trend toward consolidation in the
trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources
and other competitive advantages relating to their size.

•

Advances in technology require increased
investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to
accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments.

We derive
a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of
one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

For the calendar year ended December 31, 2005, our top 10 customers,
based on revenue, accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue. Our largest
customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 15% of our
total revenue in 2005. Our JBT and JBI segments typically do not have long-term
contracts with their customers. While our DCS segment business may involve a
written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there
is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our
services or that they will continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination
of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results.

We
depend on third parties in the operation of our business.

Our Intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance
of its transportation services. These services are provided pursuant to
contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with
various Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern Railroad. The inability
to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect
on our business and operating results. We also utilize the services of a number
of third-party dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and
destination pickups and deliveries. In addition, a portion of the freight we
deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject
to labor union contracts.

Difficulty
in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability
to grow.

Periodically, the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty
in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including ICs. A shortage of
qualified company drivers and ICs has proven to be particularly severe during
the past few years. In spite of continued increases in driver compensation and
recruiting costs, the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage
of drivers. If we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of
drivers or contract with enough independent contractors, we could be required
to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sit
idle, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

Ongoing
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.

Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical
levels, which could reduce our earnings. During 2005, we self-insured a portion
of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property
damage and health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for auto
accidents and $1 million for workers’ compensation. Effective January 1, 2006,
the self-insured portion of our claims exposure for personal injury and workers’
compensation was reduced to $500,000. If the number or severity of claims for
which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely
affected. Also, we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we
self-insure with licensed insurance companies. Insurance carriers have recently
raised premiums for most trucking


companies.
As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our
current coverages expire on July 31, 2006. If these expenses increase, and we
are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could
be materially and adversely affected.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits
associated with certain sale-and-leaseback transactions.

As previously disclosed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain
sale-and-leaseback transactions, which we entered into in 1999. Based on events
occurring subsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for a
contingent tax liability of $33.6 million at December 31, 2004. The liability
for this contingency, which included estimated interest expense, was included
on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as a long-term
liability. We accrued approximately $2.7 million of interest expense during
2005 related to this contingency. We continue to believe our tax positions
comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from
our then external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these
transactions, and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS position
using all administrative and legal processes available. If the IRS were
successful in disallowing 100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the
total ultimate impact on liquidity could be approximately $44 million,
excluding interest.

Our
operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the
violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing
with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and
discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where
truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where
groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our
operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage
and hazardous wastes disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage
and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If we are involved in a spill or
other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in
violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with
applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines
or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

We
operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of
compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our
business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in
motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial reporting. We
are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with
various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were
found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our
operations.

Effective October 1, 2005, driver HOS regulations were revised. The
majority of these rule changes had initially been effective January 4, 2004. These
collective changes were the most significant changes to driver HOS in more than
40 years. In general, the new rules require a driver to take at least eight
consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10-hour off-duty period. These
new rules primarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop freight operations and had
a minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results.

Effective October 1, 2002, the EPA required that most newly manufactured
heavy-duty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards. At
December 31, 2005, we were operating approximately 5,900 tractors with these
2002 rule-complaint engines. In addition to higher initial purchase prices,
these tractors have also experienced an average 4% to 5% reduction in fuel
efficiency. Effective with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated even
lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. We
are planning our new equipment purchases to


accommodate
these new standards, but also to allow adequate time for testing of the new
engines. We are unable to predict the impact these new standards will have on
our future operations and business results.

Rapid
changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.

Fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third-largest general
expense category. During the past several years, fuel cost per gallon has
varied significantly, with prices at times changing as much as $.20 to $.25 per
gallon between consecutive months. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in
place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to
recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically
adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing
differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel
surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when
fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled
during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be
billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could
have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of
December 31, 2005, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our
exposure to fuel price fluctuations.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our
corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas. We occupy a number of buildings
in Lowell that we utilize for administrative support, data center, primary
customer service and freight dispatch. We maintain a backup data center for
disaster recovery, maintenance shop and driver operations facility in Lowell. In
December 2005, we took occupancy of a new, approximately 110,000-square-foot
office building that was constructed adjacent to our existing 150,000-square-foot
building. This new building allowed us to reduce the number of occupied
buildings in Lowell and consolidate most of our corporate support and
centralized operations functions. We also own or lease other significant
facilities where we perform maintenance on our equipment, provide bulk fuel and
employ personnel to support operations. Each of our three business segments
utilizes our larger facilities for services including bulk fueling, maintenance
and driver support activities. In addition to our principal properties listed
below, we lease a number of small offices and parking yards throughout the
country that support our customers’ business needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal
conduct of business. Based on the present knowledge of the facts and, in
certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of claims
and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

As
previously reported, an arbitration process with BNI was concluded during
September 2005. In accordance with the settlement terms, we paid BNI $25.8
million. This payment was recorded in the third quarter of 2005. We also
increased, effective October 1, 2005, the amounts that we pay BNI for moving
freight on certain intermodal movements.

The
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits
associated with certain sale-and-leaseback transactions. See “Risk Factors” in
Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 4.
SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No
matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of 2005 to a vote of security
holders.


PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON
STOCK AND RELATED SECURITY HOLDER MATTERS

Our
common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market under the symbol “JBHT.”  At December 31, 2005, we were authorized to
issue up to one billion shares of our common stock and 167.1 million shares
were issued. The high and low sales prices of our common stock as reported by
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations National
Market system (NASDAQ) and our quarterly dividends paid per share on our common
shares were:

On
January 31, 2006, the high and low sales prices for our common stock as
reported by the NASDAQ were $24.10 and $23.46, respectively. As of January 31,
2006, we had 1,338 stockholders of record.

From
time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of our common
stock. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during the years 2002
through 2004. On December 14, 2004, our Board authorized the purchase of up to
$100 million worth of our common stock. We commenced repurchases of our common
stock in January 2005. On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized the purchase of an
additional $500 million of our common stock over the next five years.

Dividend
Policy

We
paid quarterly dividends during calendar year 1999 and in a number of years
prior to 1999. In early 2000, we announced a decision to discontinue dividend
payments. In April 2004, we re-initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.015 per
share. This re-initiation was based on our lower debt levels and improving cash
flows. We also paid a cash dividend of $.015 per share in July and October 2004.
In December 2004, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from
$.015 to $.06. Our first $.06 per share dividend was paid on February 18, 2005.
We paid a $.06 per share dividend in April, July and October 2005. In January
2006, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $.06 to
$.08, effective with our payment in February 2006. We currently intend to
continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, no assurance can
be given that future dividends will be paid, since such payments are dependent
on earnings, cash flows and other factors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The following discussion of our results of operations and financial
condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes in Item 8. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please
see “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of items,
uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to

make

estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts
reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Therefore,
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated
disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. We
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience,
consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the
particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly
from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results
of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the
accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become
known.

We
co

n

sider our critical accounting policies
and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments
and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the
following:

Workers’ Compensation and Accident Costs

We
purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries
(workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, and accidents and cargo claims. Most
insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage
applicable to each claim, but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure
to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured. The amounts of
self-insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and
policy expiration dates. During 2005, we were self-insured for essentially $2
million of our claims for personal injury and property damage and $1 million
for workers’ compensation claims. Effective January 1, 2006, the self-insured
portion of our claims exposure for personal injury, property damage and workers’
compensation was reduced to $500,000.

Our
claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability
at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of
the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well
as legal, economic and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work
directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually
update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops
over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing and extent of
damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to
develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim
liability. This process involves the use of loss-development factors based on
our historical claims experience. In doing so, the recorded liability considers
future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported
claims. We do not discount our estimated losses. At December 31, 2005, we had an
accrual of approximately $16 million for estimated net claims. In addition, we
are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums. At December
31, 2005, we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $76 million, which
represented pre-funded claims and premiums. We are also substantially
self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.

Revenue Equipment

We
operate a significant number of tractors, trailers and containers in connection
with our business. This equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or
operating lease agreements. In addition, we may rent revenue equipment from
third parties and various railroads under short-term rental arrangements. Revenue
equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight-line


method
over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value. We
had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at December 31, 2005.

We
have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade-in
values for certain new equipment. We have utilized these trade-in values as
well as other operational information, such as anticipated annual miles, in
accounting for depreciation expense. If our tractor supplier were unable to
perform under the terms of our agreement for trade-in values, it could have a
material negative impact on our financial results. We periodically review the
useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our
long-lived assets for impairment. We have not identified any impairments to our
existing assets.

Revenue Recognition

We
recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported.
Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the
customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based
on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been
completed at the end of the reporting period.

YEAR IN REVIEW

Our
financial results for calendar year 2005 represented the fourth consecutive
year of record revenues and earnings driven by good to excellent performance
from each of our segments. Our 2005 net earnings of $207.3 million, or $1.28
per diluted share, were up 42% over the $146.3 million, or $.88 per diluted
share, earned in 2004. Fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the
transportation industry during 2005. Our 2005 fuel cost per gallon averaged 33%
above 2004 levels. However, due to our fuel surcharge programs and the support
and understanding of our customers, we were able to recover the majority of our
higher fuel costs.

Freight
demand during the first half of 2005 was not as strong as the comparable period
of 2004, but volume levels improved during the last half of 2005. Our DCS and
JBT segments contributed most significantly to our higher level of
profitability in 2005. While increases in the size of the DCS and JBT tractor
fleets accounted for a portion of the increases in operating income, our
continued focus on capacity management and revenue per tractor was the primary
factor driving 2005 improved net earnings. Capacity management is a continuous
process of reviewing our freight and individual dedicated arrangements to
determine whether business that is generating low or negative margins can be
replaced by different business with better margins. We also continually analyze
our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all services that we
provide. Primarily due to our capacity-management actions and rate increases
which offset non-fuel cost increases, our 2005 revenue per tractor (excluding
fuel surcharges) increased 5.3% and 4.3% in our DCS and JBT segments,
respectively. Our JBI segment revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, also
increased 5.0% in 2005. While these rate increases were the best our intermodal
segment has experienced in several years, we did start to incur higher railroad
purchased transportation expense. Our JBI operating income was clearly reduced
by the BNI arbitration charge. The third quarter 2005 arbitration charge of
$25.8 million included $8.3 million that related to 2004 freight movements. We
also incurred significant legal fees in 2004 and 2005 associated with this
arbitration process. Excluding the effects of the $8.3 million arbitration
charge that related to 2004 freight movements, our JBI segment would have
reported an increase in 2005 operating income, compared with the decrease of
5%.

We
continued our focus on safety during 2005. Although our 2005 actual insurance
and safety costs were slightly higher than 2004, we were able to duplicate the
fine performance we saw in 2004 in terms of DOT accidents per million miles and
DOT preventable accidents per million miles. One significant result of our industry-leading
safety results over the past several years was the establishment of a
multi-year $500,000 deductible limit in our primary casualty and workers’
compensation insurance coverage. This new deductible limit was effective
January 1, 2006, and compares with $2 million for casualty and $1 million for
workers’ compensation in 2005.


Our 2005 consolidated operating ratio (operating
expenses divided by total operating revenues) was 89.0%, compared with 88.9% in
2004 and 92.4% in 2003. The current year was the second consecutive time in
over 10 years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below
90%. We re-initiated paying a quarterly cash dividend of $.015 in early 2004
and increased our dividend to $.06 in December 2004 and to $.08 in December 2005.
We also announced plans in December 2004 to repurchase up to $100 million
of our common stock and announced an additional $500 million repurchase program
in April 2005.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth items in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and
the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior
year.


2005 Compared With 2004

Consolidated Operating Revenues

Our total consolidated operating revenues rose to
$3.13 billion in 2005, a 12.3% increase over 2004. We believe that meaningful
analysis of our financial performance and revenue growth requires that fuel
surcharge (FSC) revenue, which can fluctuate significantly between reporting
periods, be excluded when making revenue comparisons. Significantly higher fuel
prices resulted in FSC revenues of $336 million in 2005, compared with $167
million in 2004. This FSC revenue impacted our year-to-year comparison. If FSC
revenues were excluded from both years, the increase of 2005 revenue over 2004
was 6.6%. This increased level of revenue, excluding FSC, was primarily a
result of rate increases, our capacity-management actions and a small increase
in the size of our tractor fleet. JBT segment revenue per loaded mile
(excluding FSC) in 2005 averaged 6.0% higher than 2004, while DCS’s revenue per
tractor (excluding FSC) rose 5.3% in 2005 over 2004. A nearly 3% increase in
2005 JBI load volume also contributed to our higher levels of revenue.

Consolidated Operating Expenses

Our total 2005 consolidated operating expenses
increased 12.4% over 2004. The combination of the 12.3% increase in 2005
revenue over 2004 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2005
operating ratio increasing slightly to 89.0% from 88.9% in 2004. The total cost
of salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 3.0% in 2005 over 2004,
primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation. Rents and purchased
transportation costs rose 13.5% in 2005, primarily due to additional funds paid
to railroads and drayage companies, related to JBI growth.

Fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 34.8% in 2005,
primarily due to 33% higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles
per gallon. We have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our
customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively
quickly when fuel costs change. It is difficult to compare the amount of FSC
revenue or the change of FSC revenue between reporting periods to fuel tax
expense or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion
of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other
third parties. These payments are classified as purchased transportation
expense. While we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases,
partly due to empty miles run and engine-idling time, we were able to recover
the majority of our increased fuel costs. The 8.9% increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was partly a result of higher new-tractor purchase prices
and an approximately 3% increase in the size of our company-owned tractor
fleet.

Operating supplies and expenses rose 7.0% in 2005,
partly a result of higher trailing equipment maintenance, tires and tolls costs.
A number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge
tolls. The significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects
higher driver recruiting and testing costs, legal and professional fees related
to our arbitration proceeding, and charitable contributions. In October 2005,
we announced a gift to the University of Arkansas that represented
approximately $5.6 million. Also included in the general and administrative
expense category, we recognized a $1.8 million net gain on the disposition of
assets in 2005, compared with a $0.4 million gain in 2004. The arbitration
settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the arbitration decision
that was discussed earlier. We accrued approximately $2.7 million of interest
expense during 2005 related to an IRS contingency. Our effective income tax
rate was 37.9% in 2005 and 51.6% in 2004. Income tax expense in 2004, included
a contingent tax liability of $33.6 million, including accrued interest,
related to the IRS’s challenge of certain sale-and-leaseback transactions that
closed in 1999.

We expect our effective income tax rate to
approximate 39.0% for calendar year 2006.

The “equity in loss of associated company” item on
our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of the operating
results of TPI.


Segments

We operated three business segments during calendar
year 2005. The operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote
11. The following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment.

Operating Data By Segment

* Reflects average use of corporate-wide trailing equipment

JBT Segment

JBT segment revenue was $1.02 billion in
2005, up 9.9% over the $928 million in 2004. Higher FSC revenue in 2005
impacted this comparison. If the amount of FSC revenue were excluded from both
years, 2005 JBT revenue rose 4.7% over 2004. The average tractor count in 2005
was essentially the same as 2004. However, revenue per loaded mile, excluding
FSC, was 6.0% above 2004. This higher level of revenue per loaded mile was
offset by approximately 1.5% lower tractor utilization. Current-year revenue
growth was also up due to additional outsourced freight activity.


Operating income of our JBT segment climbed
to $119 million in 2005, from $103 million in 2004. The significant increase in
revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, accounted for the majority of this
operating income improvement.

JBI Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 15.2%, to $1.28
billion in 2005, from $1.12 billion in 2004. If FSC revenue were excluded from
both years, 2005 segment revenue increased 8.6% over 2004. A significant
portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 5.0% increase in revenue per
loaded mile, excluding FSC. In addition, 2005 load volume increased 2.9% over
2004. The remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes
in freight mix.

Operating income in our JBI segment declined
to $124 million in 2005, from $131 million in 2004. As previously described, a
$25.8 million arbitration settlement paid to BNI during the third quarter of
2005 reduced JBI operating income. In addition, this settlement also resulted
in higher rail purchased transportation expense effective October 1, 2005.
These costs more than offset the impact of higher rates and volume in the
segment.

DCS Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 11.1% to $844
million in 2005, from $760 million in 2004. The increase in fuel surcharge
revenue in 2005 significantly impacted this comparison. If we exclude fuel
surcharge revenue from both years, DCS segment revenue rose 6.3% over 2004. This
increase in revenue resulted from a combination of a 2.5% increase in the
average tractor count and a 5.3% increase in net revenue per tractor, excluding
FSC. These increases were partly offset by a 1.4% decline in revenue related to
freight delivered by third-party carriers. The majority of these movements were
billed by us to the customer in 2004. In 2005, a larger portion of these
movements were billed directly to our customer by the third-party carrier.

Operating income rose 34% to $100 million in
2005, compared with $75 million in 2004. Similar to 2004, we conducted reviews
of our underperforming dedicated accounts, identifying opportunities to either
improve margins or redeploy assets. Financial discipline in the area of pricing
and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2005 generated
appropriate financial returns. We also remained focused on cost controls and
raised rates when appropriate. These efforts have improved our DCS segment
operating ratio to 88.1% in 2005 from 90.2% in 2004.

2004 Compared With 2003

Overview of 2004

Our consolidated net earnings for calendar
year 2004 totaled a record $146 million. This compares with our previous record
net earnings of $95 million in 2003. Diluted earnings per share were $.88 in
2004, also a record number, compared with $.58 in 2003. The average number of
diluted shares outstanding in 2004 was approximately 2% higher than the
comparable number in 2003. Consolidated operating revenues were $2.79 billion
in 2004, an increase of 14% over the $2.43 billion in 2003.

Each of our business segments contributed to
our improved financial results in 2004. While the overall economy and level of
freight activity were not particularly strong during 2004, a number of factors
contributed to our improved level of earnings. We continued our focus on
capacity management, as well as individual load and lane profitability. A
number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus
allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to
properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers. In addition,
the levels of available capacity in the industry were reduced by significant
increases in insurance, fuel, equipment


and driver compensation costs. The availability of qualified drivers
also limited carriers’ ability to expand the size of their fleets.

JBT Segment

JBT segment revenue was $928 million in 2004,
up 10% over the $841 million in 2003. Higher FSC revenue in 2004 impacted this
comparison. If the amount of FSC revenue were excluded from both years, 2004
JBT segment revenue rose 7.9% over 2003. The average tractor count in 2004
declined 3.1% from 2003. However, revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, was
8.7% above 2003, offsetting the decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing
operating income. 2004 revenue growth was also up approximately 2% from
outsourced freight activity.

Operating income of the JBT segment rose to
$103 million in 2004, from $49 million in 2003. The significant increase in
revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, accounted for the majority of this
operating income improvement. In addition, lower JBT accident and workers’
compensation costs positively impacted 2004 operating income.

JBI Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 19%, to $1.12
billion in 2004, from $936 million in 2003. Higher FSC revenue in 2004 impacted
this comparison. If FSC revenue were excluded from both years, 2004 JBI segment
revenue increased 15.8% over 2003. A significant portion of this revenue growth
was driven by a 10.3% increase in loads. Revenue per loaded mile, excluding
FSC, was 3.4% above 2003 levels. The remaining portion of revenue growth was
primarily a result of freight mix changes.

Operating income in the JBI segment increased
to $131 million in 2004 from $91 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 JBI
operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded
mile, excluding FSC, increased load volume and lower revenue equipment
ownership costs, partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation
expenses.

DCS Segment

DCS segment revenue grew over 13% to $760
million in 2004, from $671 million in 2003. The higher level of FSC revenue in
2004 impacted this comparison. If FSC revenue were excluded from both years,
2004 DCS segment revenue rose 10% over 2003. The average number of trucks in
the dedicated fleet increased nearly 5% in 2004. The additional revenue growth
in 2004 was primarily a result of a 6% increase in net revenue per tractor.

Operating income increased 65% to $75 million
in 2004 versus $45 million in 2003. During 2004, we conducted reviews of our
underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either
improve margins or redeploy assets. We also implemented cost controls and
raised rates as appropriate. These efforts improved our DCS segment operating
ratio to 90.2% in 2004 from 93.3% in 2003.

Consolidated Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased 10.2% in
2004 over 2003, while operating revenues increased 14.5%. The combination of
the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by
350 basis points to 88.9% in 2004, from 92.4% in 2003. As previously mentioned,
increases in revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, and lower casualty and
workers’ compensation claims costs were two of the more significant factors
driving these changes. We also increased the number of ICs in our JBT and DCS
fleets to 1,301 at December 31, 2004, from 994 at the end of 2003. When we
replace company-operated tractors and driver employees with ICs, certain costs
such as salaries, wages, employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs
such as purchased transportation increase.

The expense category of salaries, wages and
employee benefits declined to 29.8% of revenue in 2004 from 32.5% in 2003 and
the total expense dollars only increased 4.8% from 2003, compared with


the 14.5% increase in revenue. While we did increase compensation
levels for many of our drivers in 2004, these increases were partly offset by
lower workers’ compensation costs. The number of company drivers at December 31,
2004, was approximately equal to the number at the end of 2003. The 16.6%
increase in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional
funds paid to railroads and drayage companies, related to JBI business growth,
and to the continued expansion of our IC fleets.

Fuel cost per gallon was approximately 21%
higher in 2004 over 2003. This increase in fuel costs and slightly lower fuel
efficiency accounted for the 24.2% increase in fuel costs. We have fuel
surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to
adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change. If fuel costs change
rapidly, we may experience some financial impact from timing differences
between financial reporting periods. We were able to recover substantially all
of our increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year 2004. We have no
contract or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs.

The decline in insurance and claims expense
was primarily due to lower accident and claims experience in 2004. As mentioned
above, we have continued to focus on safety throughout our entire organization.
The category of general and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting
and testing, legal and professional fees, and bad debt expense. Gains and
losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and
administrative category. We experienced a net gain of approximately $402,000 on
revenue equipment and other dispositions in 2004, compared with a $1.1 million
loss in 2003.

Our net interest expense declined to $5.5
million in 2004 from $17.2 million in 2003. We continued to reduce our debt and
capitalized lease obligations during 2004 and paid off all our remaining
balance sheet debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2004. Our
continued improvement in net earnings and strong cash flow allowed us to pay
off this debt. Our effective income tax rate was 51.6% in 2004, compared with
43.1% in 2003. Income tax expense in 2004 reflects a contingent tax liability
of $33.6 million, including accrued interest expense, related to certain
sale-and-leaseback transactions that closed in 1999. Income tax expense in 2003
reflected the reversal of $7.7 million of non-cash tax benefits taken in early
2003 related to these sale-and-leaseback transactions. See Risk Factors for
additional information on this matter. Our 2004 and 2003 income tax rates are
also higher than statutory federal and state rates, primarily due to our driver
per diem plan. This plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers
and to the Company. However, it does result in an increase in our effective
income tax rates.

The “equity in loss of associated company”
item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the
operating results for Transplace, Inc. (TPI). Effective January 1,
2003, we increased our interest in TPI to approximately 37%, from 27% in 2002. JBHT’s
financial exposure is limited to its approximate $5.3 million investment in TPI
since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of TPI’s
financial obligations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We generate significant amounts of cash provided by
operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $332
million in 2005, $405 million in 2004 and $333 million in 2003. Our continued
improvement in net earnings from 2003 to 2005 has enhanced net cash from
operations. The decline in 2005 cash provided by operating activities was partly
due to larger federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts
receivable. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was reduced
relative to 2004 by the change in deferred income taxes, which in turn, was a
result of reduced tax depreciation expense. The 2005 use of cash for trade
accounts payable was partly due to timing differences of payments for insurance
premiums. Cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions
to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment. The higher level of
cash used in investing activities during 2004 was a result of delayed tractor
purchases in early 2003, while we were testing the new EPA-compliant engines,
and our decision in late 2003 to commence purchasing tractors that were under
capital lease arrangements. We paid $60.8 million in 2004 to


purchase
tractors that were previously under capital lease programs. At December 31,
2005, we had no revenue equipment on capital leases.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2005
reflects the repurchase of $239 million of our common stock. We utilized cash
to pay down debt and to purchase revenue equipment off capital leases in 2003
and 2004. We borrowed $124 million during 2005, primarily to fund stock
repurchases and the payment of dividends.

Selected Balance Sheet Data

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes
the repurchase of our common stock. We did not repurchase any of our common
stock during the years 2002 through 2004. As previously mentioned, the Board,
in December 2004, authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of our
common stock during the next year. We commenced repurchases of our common stock
in January 2005. On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized the purchase
of an additional $500 million of our common stock over the next five years.

Liquidity

Our need for capital typically has resulted from the
acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the
replacement of older revenue equipment with new, late-model equipment. We are
frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements
depending on market conditions. We have, during the past few years, obtained
capital through a secondary common stock offering, revolving lines of credit
and cash generated from operations. We have also periodically utilized capital
and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment.

Since late 2001, we have been acquiring tractors and
trailing equipment primarily under purchase and operating lease arrangements,
and we anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future. We
are currently committed to spend approximately $277 million, net of expected
proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances, on revenue equipment and acquisition
of new facilities and property in 2006.

We are authorized to borrow up to $200 million under
our current revolving line of credit, which expires in April 2010. At December 31,
2005, we had a $124 million balance outstanding under that agreement. While we
do anticipate some need to borrow additional amounts on our revolver during
2006, we believe that our liquid assets, cash generated from operations and
revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and
capital requirements for the foreseeable future. Our revolving line of credit
does not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or amounts
due under the agreement.

We have spent approximately $239 million on stock
repurchases during calendar year 2005. We have authorization to spend an
additional $361 million to repurchase our common stock through 2010.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no capitalized lease arrangements at December 31,
2005. Our only off-balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating
leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and
facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 20,100 trailers
and 5,900 containers/chassis that were subject to operating leases, and we had
approximately $112 million of obligations remaining under these leases.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payments. SFAS No. 123R
is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminated the use
of APB 25 and the intrinsic-value method of accounting and requires companies
to recognize in their financial statements the cost of employee services
received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options,
based on the grant date fair value of those awards. In accordance with SFAS No. 123R,
the cost will be based on the fair value at the grant date of the award and
will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires
us to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding
share-based payments. This expense must be based on the fair value of the award
on the grant date. It will also require the benefits associated with tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation to be reported as a financing
cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required. We will
adopt SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006. Upon adoption, we will


use
the modified prospective method and therefore will not restate our prior-period
results. SFAS No. 123R will apply to new share-based awards and to
unvested stock options outstanding on the effective date. Based on our current
understanding of SFAS No. 123R, we believe this new accounting standard
will reduce our calendar year 2006 net earnings by between three and four cents
per share. While this estimate represents the financial impact of shared-based
payments outstanding at December 31, 2005, we are unable to predict the
impact of any share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31,
2005.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We had $124 million of debt outstanding at December 31,
2005, under our revolving line of credit. The interest rate applicable to this
agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR. Our earnings would be
affected by changes in these short-term interest rates. Risk can be quantified
by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse increase in short-term
interest rates. At our current level of borrowing, a one percent increase in
our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by $1.2 million. We
have no interest rate derivatives in place at December 31, 2005, to
mitigate this risk.

Although we conduct business in foreign countries,
international operations are not material to our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, foreign currency
transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, we are not currently
subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that
exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or
on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment. To date, we
have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other
derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

The price and availability of diesel fuel are
subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production,
seasonality, weather and other market factors. Historically, we have been able
to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of
fuel surcharges. We cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels
will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be
collected to offset such increases. As of December 31, 2005, we had no
derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. 
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005.  In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

.  Based on our assessment, we believe that as
of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm that also audited our consolidated financial
statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s

of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s internal control

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of our
consolidated financial statements and related information appearing in this
report. We take these responsibilities very seriously and are committed to
maintaining controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that we
collect the information we are required to disclose in our reports to the SEC
and to process, summarize and disclose this information within the time periods
specified by the SEC.

Based on
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, and conducted by our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
believe that our controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are
able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed with the SEC within the required time periods.

We are
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting
is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of
Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that J.B.
Hunt Transport Services, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheet of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then
ended of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and our report dated March 6,
2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

1.

Business

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT or we), together with our
wholly owned subsidiaries, are one of the largest truckload, logistics and
dedicated transportation services companies in North America.  We directly transport or arrange for the
transportation of full truckload, containerizable freight and arrange for
customized freight movement services operating under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Department of Transportation and various state regulatory agencies.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.

Basis
of Consolidation

JBHT’s consolidated financial statements include our financial
statements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

B.

Use
of Estimates

The consolidated financial statements contained in this report have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  The
preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that directly affect the amounts reported in such statements and accompanying
notes.  We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and
using other methods we consider reasonable in the particular
circumstances.  Nevertheless, our actual
results may differ significantly from our estimates.

We believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more
significance in our financial statement preparation process than others.  We believe the most critical accounting
policies and estimates include the economic useful lives and salvage values of
our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, and estimates of
exposures under our insurance and claims plans. 
To the extent that actual, final outcomes are different than our
estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our
estimates, our earnings during that accounting period will be affected.

C.    Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to
conform to current-year presentation.

D.    Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly
liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

E.     Tires in Service

We capitalize tires placed in service on new revenue equipment as a
part of the equipment cost.  Replacement
tires and costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are
placed in service.


F.     Property and Equipment

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 10 years for
tractors and 7 to 15 years for trailing equipment, 10 to 40 years for
structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office
equipment.  Salvage values are typically
10% to 15% for tractors and trailing equipment. 
Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition of equipment are
recognized at the time of the disposition and are classified in general and
administrative expenses.

G.    Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based on relative transit time in each reporting
period, with expenses recognized as incurred.

H.    Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability
method.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as
income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

I.      Earnings Per Share

A
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings
per share is shown below (in thousands, except per-share amounts):


Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding during
each year, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares, are shown in the table below.

On April 21, 2005, we announced a two-for-one stock
split on our common stock, payable May 23, 2005, to stockholders of record on
May 2, 2005.  All references in our
financial statements with regard to number of shares and the per-share amounts
have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk, consist primarily of trade receivables.  For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately
40%, 42% and 38%, respectively, of our total revenue.  At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our top 10
customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 35% and 33%,
respectively, of our total trade accounts receivable.  One customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
accounted for 15%, 15% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenue for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
Each of our three business segments conducts business with Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.

K.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We have adopted the intrinsic value based method of Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in
accounting for compensation costs for our stock option plans.  Accordingly, compensation expense is
recognized on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying common stock at date of grant exceeds the exercise price.

Had we determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the
grant date for our stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

, our net earnings would have been reduced
to the pro forma amounts indicated below:


Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted since December 31,
1995.  Therefore, the full impact of
calculating compensation costs for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not
reflected in the pro forma net earnings amounts presented above because
compensation cost is reflected over the options’ vesting periods of 5 to 10
years and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1996, is
not considered.

The per-share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted
during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $10.76, $11.00 and $6.45, respectively, on the
date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:  2005 - expected dividend
yield 1.06%, volatility of 54.1%, risk-free interest rate of 4.33%, and an
expected life of 6.4 years;  2004 -
expected dividend yield 1.08%, volatility of 55.6%, risk-free interest rate of
2.19%, and an expected life of 6.6 years; 
2003 - expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 57.4%, risk-free
interest rate of 1.53%, and an expected life of 6.3 years.

L.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

We continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or
changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

M.

Claims Accruals

Claims accruals represent the self-insured portion of pending accident
liability, workers’ compensation and physical damage claims.  These accruals are estimated based on our
evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of
future claims development based


on
our past claims experience.  Our
claims-accrual policy for all self-insurance is to recognize the expense when
the event occurs and the costs of such events are probable and reasonably
estimable.  We apply loss-development
factors to our accident and workers’ compensation claims history as a part of
our process of recording accruals for losses that are incurred but not
reported.  We do not discount our
estimated losses.

Our insurance coverage for the two years ended December 31, 2005,
specified that the self-insured limit was the first $2 million for personal
injury and property damage and $1 million for workers’ compensation
claims.  During the year ended December
31, 2003, our self-insured limit on the majority of all our claims was $1.5
million.  Effective January 1, 2006, our
self-insured limits were reduced to $500,000. 
We are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned
and leased revenue equipment.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payments. 
SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB 25. 
Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminated the use of APB 25 and the
intrinsic-value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize in
their financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange
for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options, based on the grant
date fair value of those awards.  In
accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the cost will be based on the fair value at the
grant date of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires us to
recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding
share-based payments.  This expense must
be based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.  It will also require the benefits associated
with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation to be reported as a
financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently
required.  We will adopt SFAS No. 123R on
January 1, 2006.  Upon adoption, we will
use the modified prospective method and therefore will not restate our
prior-period results.  SFAS No. 123R will
apply to new share-based awards and to unvested stock options outstanding on
the effective date.  Based on our current
understanding of SFAS No. 123R, we believe this new accounting standard will
reduce our calendar year 2006 net earnings by between three and four cents per
share.  While this estimate represents
the financial impact of shared-based payments outstanding at December 31, 2005,
we are unable to predict the impact of any share-based payments granted
subsequent to December 31, 2005.

3.

Debt (in thousands)

At December 31, 2005, we were authorized to borrow up to $200 million
under our current revolving line of credit and had a $124 million balance outstanding
under that agreement.  This line of
credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in
April 2010.  The applicable interest rate
under our agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon
the


specific
type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our
credit rating.  The average interest rate
on our outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2005, was 5.12%.

4.

Capital Stock

We maintain a Management Incentive Plan (“Plan”) that provides various
financial vehicles to compensate our key employees with JBHT common stock or
common stock equivalents.  Under the
Plan, as amended, we are authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than 44
million shares. At December 31, 2005, there were approximately 12.6 million
shares available for grant under the Plan. 
We have utilized three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to
purchase JBHT common stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options and
nonstatutory stock options.  We awarded
approximately 633,000 shares of restricted stock during 2005.  These restricted shares have various vesting
schedules ranging from five to ten years. 
These restricted shares do not contain rights to vote or receive
dividends until the vesting date.  The
compensation cost of these restricted shares was calculated based on the
grant-date market value and totaled $.5 million in 2005.  We recognize the cost of these restricted
shares based on a straight-line basis, treating each vesting date as a separate
grant.

The Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key
employees for the purchase of JBHT common stock for 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the grant date.  The options generally vest over a 10-year
period and are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason other than
death, disability or retirement, after age 55. 
The Plan allows the employee to surrender shares of common stock that
the employee has owned for at least six months in full or partial payment of
the option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy withholding tax
obligations incident to the exercise of an option.

A summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase JBHT
common stock follows:


The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding at December 31, 2005:

The weighted average exercise
price per share of options exercisable at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $4.70
and $4.21, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes
consists of (in thousands):


Income tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes
differed from the amounts computed using the statutory federal income tax rate
of 35% for the following reasons (in thousands):

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December
31, 2005 and 2004, are presented below (in thousands):


Income taxes payable at December 31, 2005, were $1.9 million and
refundable income taxes at December 31, 2004, were $19.4 million.  These amounts have been included in other
accrued expenses and income tax receivable on the balance sheet, respectively.

We believe our history of profitability and taxable income, the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and our utilization of tax planning
sufficiently supports the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, we have not recorded a valuation
allowance as all deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

The Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain
sale-and-leaseback transactions.

In 1999, we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and
leaseback of a portion of our Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a
selling price of approximately $175 million. 
This transaction was examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and
1999 tax returns.  In December 2003, we
received an IRS Notice of Proposed Assessment which disallowed the tax benefits
associated with these transactions, and as a result, we have filed an appeal in
the matter.  We have had preliminary
discussions with the IRS Appeals Division and have been informed that the IRS
Examination Division has been instructed to prepare additional work since their
case had not been developed adequately for the appellate hearing.  To date, we have not been contacted by the
IRS Examination Division to provide any additional information for their review.  If a resolution of the matter cannot be
reached in the appeals process, the IRS will forward a 90-day letter, also
known as a Notice of Deficiency. A resolution of the dispute could occur at any
point in the administrative process or could extend through a trial and court
appeals.  If we are unsuccessful in
defending this transaction, we could owe additional taxes and interest.  Based on events occurring subsequent to
December 31, 2004, we have reversed all prior benefits taken on this
transaction, including accrued interest. 
The liability for this contingency, approximately $36.3 million
(including accrued interest) at December 31, 2005, and $33.6 million at
December 31, 2004, is a component of other long-term liabilities on our balance
sheets and not a component of deferred income taxes.  We continue to believe our tax positions
comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from
our then external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these
transactions, and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS position
using all administrative and legal processes available.  If the IRS were successful in disallowing
100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the total ultimate impact on
liquidity could be approximately $44 million, excluding interest.

6.

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which
includes a 401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to
participate.  We match a specified
percentage of employee contributions, subject to certain limitations.  For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, JBHT matching contributions to the plan were $7.6 million, $6.0
million and $6.2 million, respectively.

7.

Fair Value of Significant Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and trade accounts payable on our balance sheets at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.  Long-term debt at December 31, 2005,
approximates fair value since the applicable interest rates approximate fair
market rates.

Related-Party Transactions

Dr. John A. White has been a member of our Board of Directors since
1998 and serves as the Chairman of our Audit Committee.  Dr. White is the Chancellor of the University
of Arkansas.  In October 2005, we
announced a gift of $10 million to the University of Arkansas to facilitate the
construction of a new J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Center for Academic
Excellence building.  Johnelle D. Hunt is
the wife of our founder and former Senior Chairman of the Board, Mr. J.B.
Hunt.  She also serves as our Corporate
Secretary and has been a member of our Board of Directors since 1993.  Mrs. Hunt serves as Treasurer for the
University of Arkansas’ Campaign for the 21

st

Century.  Neither of the aforementioned board members
was instrumental in securing this contribution, nor did either participate in
the voting processes related to this transaction.

In April 2004, we sold an aircraft hanger, which the Company had owned
since 1993.  Net proceeds from this sale
totaled $988,000 and we recognized an approximate $532,000 gain on this sale.  The hanger was sold to Pinnacle Air Facilities
LLC (Pinnacle).  Mr. J.B. Hunt, our
former Senior Chairman, is a principal and a director of Pinnacle.  The selling price of the hanger was approved
by our Board of Directors and was based on a written appraisal of the property
prepared by an independent third-party appraiser.

9.

Commitments and Contingencies

During 1999, we entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction for a
portion of our container fleet. 
Containers having a net book value of approximately $175 million were
sold to third-party leasing companies at approximate net book value.  A gain of approximately $600,000 on the
transaction has been deferred and will be amortized to income in relation to
rent expense recognized under the leases. 
The containers are being leased back under operating leases over terms
of four to ten years.  Approximately $5.9
million of this intermodal trailing equipment was repurchased in December 2004.

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $112 million of
obligations remaining under operating lease arrangements related to trailing
equipment, terminal facilities and computer equipment.  None of our operating leases contains any
guaranteed residual value clauses.  Under
the terms of certain lease agreements, we are required to maintain certain
covenants, including minimum credit ratings. 
We were in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2005.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
(with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December
31, 2005, are (in thousands):


Total rent expense was $93.5 million in 2005, $95.0 million in 2004,
and $109.2 million in 2003.

At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding commitments to acquire
approximately $277 million of revenue equipment and property in 2006.  This amount is net of expected allowances and
sales proceeds from equipment dispositions.

During 2005, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a
guarantee of our performance under certain operating lease commitments and
self-insurance arrangements.  If we
default on our commitments under the lease agreements or other arrangements, we
are required to perform under these guarantees. 
The undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make future
payments in the event of defaults is approximately $26.0 million.

We are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising
from the normal conduct of business. 
Based on the present knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases,
opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and
pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, our results of operations or our liquidity.

As
previously disclosed, an arbitration process commenced on July 2, 2004, with
the BNSF Railway (BNI).  BNI provides a
significant amount of rail transportation services to our JBI business
segment.  The arbitration process was
initiated in accordance with the terms of our Joint Service Agreement (JSA)
with BNI, after we were unable to resolve our disagreements through mediation.  We announced that an interim award was issued
by the arbitration panel on September 16, 2005. 
As a result of this decision, we recorded, in the third quarter of 2005,
pretax charges of $25.8 million, or $16.5 million after income taxes.  On October 19, 2005, the arbitration panel
issued an order terminating this arbitration proceeding and declaring that the
interim award be adopted as the final award in this matter.  Normal commercial business activity between
the parties, including load tendering, load tracing, billing and payments, has
continued on a timely basis during the entire mediation and arbitration
process.

10.

Affiliated Company

We have a 37% ownership interest in a logistics joint venture called
Transplace, Inc. (TPI). TPI was formed in July 2000 when we, along with five
other motor carriers, contributed our existing non-asset-based logistics
business to the new entity.  No gain or
loss was recognized upon the formation of TPI. 
We routinely enter into transactions with TPI regarding the movement of
freight.  We provide various services to
TPI under a shared-service agreement, primarily related to computer system
operations, services and maintenance.  We
earn transportation revenues from and purchase transportation services from
TPI.  We also utilize travel services
provided by TPI.  We advanced funds to
TPI in the form of a note receivable during 2005.  This note receivable balance, including
accrued interest, was $8.6 million at December 31, 2005, carried an interest
rate of 6.0% and is due on January 7, 2007. 
This note receivable from TPI is classified as an other asset on our
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005.  A summary of our revenues and expenses
related to TPI for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2005, and balance
sheet amounts at December 31, 2005 and 2004, is presented below (in millions):

Segment Information

We have three reportable business segments, Truck (JBT), Intermodal
(JBI), and Dedicated Contract Services (DCS). 
JBT business includes full truckload dry-van freight that is typically
transported utilizing company-owned or company-controlled revenue equipment.  This freight is typically transported over
roads and highways and does not move by rail. 
The JBI segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at
least some portion of the movement and also includes certain repositioning
truck freight moved by JBI equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway
movement is intended to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal
operations.  DCS segment business
typically includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers that
are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS operations usually include formal,
written long-term agreements or contracts which govern services performed and
applicable rates.


Our
customers are geographically dispersed across the United States.  One customer accounted for approximately 15%,
15% and 13% of consolidated operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  A summary of certain
segment information is presented below (in millions):
