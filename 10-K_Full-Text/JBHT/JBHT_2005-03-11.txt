FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
report, including documents which are incorporated by reference, and other
documents which we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), contains statements that may be considered to be “forward-looking
statements.”  Such statements relate to
our predictions concerning future events or operations and are within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Forward-looking
statements are inherently uncertain, subject to risks, and should be viewed
with caution.  These statements are based
on our belief or interpretation of information currently available.  Stockholders and prospective investors are
cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from the
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Some of the factors and events that are not
within our control and that could have a material impact on future operating
results include:  general economic and
business conditions, competition and competitive rate fluctuations, cost and
availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and retain qualified drivers, a
loss of one or more major customers, interference with or termination of our
relationships with certain railroads, insurance costs and availability, claims
expense, retention of key employees, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war,
adverse weather conditions, new or different environmental or other laws and
regulations, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the
value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to
perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade-in
values.  Current and future changes in
fuel prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly earnings.

You
should understand that many important factors, in addition to those listed
above, could impact us financially.  Our
operating results may fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or
events as described in our filings with the SEC.  Some important factors that could cause our
actual results to differ from estimates or projections contained in the
forward-looking statements are described under “Risk Factors” in Item 7.  We assume no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement to the extent we become aware that it will not be
achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1

.

BUSINESS

Overview

We are one of the largest
surface transportation companies in North America.  J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT) is
a publicly held holding company, which together with our wholly owned
subsidiaries and associated companies provides a wide range of transportation
services to a diverse group of customers throughout the continental United
States, Canada and Mexico.  We were
incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1961, and have been a publicly held
company since our initial public offering in 1983.  Our service offerings include transportation
of full truck-load containerizable freight, which we directly transport
utilizing our company-controlled revenue equipment and company drivers or
independent contractors.  We also manage
and provide tailored, technology-driven freight services which may employ
equipment and transportation services provided by all major North American rail
carriers, an associated logistics company or by unrelated third parties in the
industry.

Our business operations
are primarily organized through three distinct, but complementary, business
segments.  These segments include full
truck-load dry-van (JBT), intermodal (JBI) and dedicated contract services
(DCS).  In addition, we operated a
logistics business segment from 1992 until mid-2000.  Effective July 1, 2000, we, along with five
other publicly held transportation companies, contributed our logistics
business to a new, commonly owned company, Transplace, Inc.  For the calendar year ended December 31,
2004, our consolidated revenue totaled $2.8 billion.  Of this total, $1.12 billion, or 40%, was
generated by our JBI business segment. 
Our JBT segment generated $928 million, or 33%, of total revenue and DCS
represented $760 million, or 27%.


Additional general
information about us is available from our Internet website at www.jbhunt.com.
We make a number of reports and other information available free of charge on
our website including our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, as well as earnings releases. 
Our website also contains corporate governance guidelines, codes of
conduct, our whistleblower policy, committee charters for our board of
directors and officer certifications of our filings with the SEC.

Business Strategy

We seek to add value to each of our customer’s supply chain by
providing superior service at competitive rates while controlling or minimizing
our customers’ costs through network density, transportation mode conversion
and dedicated fleets.  We believe that
our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and
returns to stockholders.

Recent Focus

During the past four years, we have taken significant steps to
re-establish a primary focus on the profitability of our three business
segments.  In each segment we have
implemented capacity management decision-making processes that result in the
deployment of our assets where we believe they will generate more profit.  We continually seek to replace
less-profitable freight with higher-margin freight and lanes.  Selective pricing actions and ensuring that
we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major
focus.  We have also worked to ingrain
safety into our corporate culture, which has reduced our accident and injury
costs during 2003 and 2004.

JBT Segment

Our primary transportation
service offerings classified in this segment include full truck-load, dry-van
freight which is predominantly transported utilizing company-controlled
tractors.  We pick up our freight at the
dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to
the location of the consignee.  Most of
our loads are transported entirely by our company-owned tractors and employee
drivers, or by independent contractors (ICs) who agree to transport freight in
our trailers.  We also assign freight to
be handled by third-party motor carriers other than ICs.  Typically, in these cases, the charges for
the entire movement are billed to the customer by us, and we, in turn, pay the
third party for their portion of the transportation services provided.

We operate
utilizing certain Canadian authorities, allowing us to transport freight to and
from all points in the continental United States to Quebec, British Columbia
and Ontario.  We have authorization to
operate directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date we have served
limited points in Canada, primarily through interchange operations with
Canadian motor carriers.  We operated our
JBT and JBI segments in combined fashion in periods prior to January 1, 2000.  This combined operation was reported as
Van/Intermodal (“Van”) in prior periods. 
In late 2000, we began utilizing ICs in the JBT segment and at December
31, 2004, we had 1,113 ICs operating in the JBT segment.  JBT gross revenue for calendar year 2004 was
$928 million, compared with $841 million in 2003.  At December 31, 2004, the JBT segment
operated 4,280 company-controlled tractors and employed 5,846 people, 4,866 of
whom were drivers.

JBI Segment

The transportation
service offerings of our JBI segment utilize agreements with most major North
American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our
customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and Mexico.  Our JBI segment began operations in 1989 with
a unique partnership with the former Santa Fe Railway (now the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe), a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement
that linked major rail and truck-load carriers in a joint marketing
environment.  Essentially, JBI draws on
the intermodal (also known as “container on flatcar”) services of rail carriers
for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups
and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at the origin and destination rail
terminal locations. We may directly provide the drayage service at either the
origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our company-controlled tractors, or
we purchase these services from third parties. 
JBI provides


seamless

coordination of the rail and over-the-road transport movements for our
customers and delivers single billing for the complete door-to-door service.

Our intermodal
program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to nearly 582,000 in 2004.  JBI operates more than 22,000
company-controlled containers system wide. 
The entire fleet is comprised of 53-foot, high-cube containers and is
designed to take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior
ride quality.  JBI also manages a fleet
of 1,192 tractors and 1,535 drivers in support of intermodal operations.  At December 31, 2004, the total JBI employee
count was 1,759, including 1,535 drivers. 
Gross revenue for the JBI segment in calendar year 2004 was $1.12
billion, compared with $936 million in 2003. 
As we have previously reported, we are engaged in an arbitration process
with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad to clarify certain terms of our
Joint Service Agreement.  See  “Risk Factors” in
Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

DCS Segment

Since 1992, we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service
option.  DCS segment operations
specialize in the design, development, and execution of customer specific fleet
solutions.  Capitalizing on advanced
systems and technologies, DCS offers transportation engineering solutions that
support private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation and transportation
system augmentation.  DCS operations
typically provide customized services that are governed by long-term contracts
and currently include dry-van, flatbed, temperature-controlled and local
operations.

DCS operations
focus on reducing costs and enhancing customer value through leveraging the
JBHT network for backhaul repositioning freight.  Network freight may be used to reposition
equipment near outbound domiciles, thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and
system cost.  DCS also frequently finds
synergy in shared resources with the JBT and JBI segments, including terminals,
drivers, maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations, and trailer pools providing
further economies of scale.  DCS gross
revenue for calendar year 2004 was $760 million, compared with $671 million in
2003.  In early 2004, we began utilizing
ICs in the DCS segment and at December 31, 2004, we had 188 ICs operating in
the DCS segment.  At December 31, 2004,
the DCS segment operated 4,679 company-controlled and 178 customer-owned
tractors, and employed 5,733 people,  5,082 of whom were drivers.

Logistics Business and Associated Company

We officially began offering transportation logistics services in 1992
through a wholly owned subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics (JBL).  JBL services frequently included an
arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a substantial portion of its
entire distribution and transportation process to one organization.  The JBL segment business included a wide
range of comprehensive transportation and management services, including
experienced professional managers, information and optimization technology and
the actual design or redesign of system solutions.  A new logistics customer or service
arrangement frequently required a significant amount of up-front analysis and
design time, during which alternatives were considered and custom systems and
software were developed.  Effective July
1, 2000, we contributed substantially all of our JBL segment business, all
related intangible assets and $5 million of cash to a newly formed company,
Transplace, Inc. (TPI).

TPI is an Internet-based global transportation logistics company.  TPI commenced operations in July 2000 and
initially included substantially all of the logistics business of JBHT,
Covenant Transport, Inc., Swift Transportation Co., Inc., U.S. Xpress
Enterprises, Inc., and Werner Enterprises, Inc. 
TPI gross revenue for calendar year 2004 was $705 million, compared with
$655 million in 2003.  We initially had
an approximate 27% ownership interest in TPI. 
In November 2002, we agreed to purchase a portion of Werner Enterprises,
Inc.’s (Werner) ownership interest in TPI. 
Effective January 1, 2003, our interest in TPI increased from 27% to 37%
and Werner’s interest declined from 15% to 5%. 
The financial results of TPI are included on a one-line, non-operating
item included on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled “Equity in
loss of associated companies.”


Operations
in Mexico

We have provided transportation services to and from Mexico since
1989.  These services frequently involve
equipment interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers.  In addition, a joint venture agreement with
Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), one of the largest transportation
companies in Mexico, was signed in 1992. 
The joint venture, Comercializadora Internacional de Carga S.A. de C.V.
and its subsidiaries, originated and completed northbound and southbound
international truck movements between the United States and Mexico.  The joint venture also provided Mexican
domestic irregular route truck service, refrigerated freight services, Mexican
dedicated contract business and short-haul drayage to and from the Mexican maritime
ports and rail heads.

As previously reported, we sold our joint venture interest in Mexico to
TMM during the first quarter of 2002 in exchange for $22.5 million, including a $18.1 million note receivable.  We have received approximately $18.0 million
of principal and interest related to this note. 
At December 31, 2004, we have a $1.7 million account receivable from TMM
and expect to receive these remaining funds during the first quarter of 2005.  These transactions have had no net impact on
our earnings.  We still provide
transportation services to and from Mexico primarily by utilizing the services
of a variety of Mexican carriers.

Marketing and Operations

We transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of
freight, including forest and paper products, building materials, general
merchandise, food and beverages, chemicals and automotive parts.  Our customer base is extremely diverse and
includes a growing list of Fortune 500 companies.  Our ability to offer multiple services,
utilizing our three business segments and a full complement of logistics
services through third parties, represents a competitive advantage.  We have been reasonably successful providing
a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a
limited number of “core” carriers.  Our
largest customer in 2004 was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for
approximately 15% of our total revenue.

We generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide
sales and marketing network.  We do have
some sales and marketing functions managed at the business unit level,
particularly for our DCS segment.  In
accordance with our typical arrangements, we bill the customer for all services
and we, in turn, pay all third parties for their portion of transportation
services provided.  In recent years, we
have re-established a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of
our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided.

People

We believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our
competitors is our service-oriented people. 
As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 15,850 employees,
including 11,483 company drivers.  We also
had arrangements with 1,301 ICs to transport freight in our trailing equipment.  In addition, we employed 1,072 mechanics and
3,295 office personnel at the end of 2004. 
None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective
bargaining agreements.

Our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and
retaining enough qualified truck drivers. 
It is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to
exceed 100%.  It has been our practice
during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an above-average level
in order to attract a high caliber of experience and minimize turnover.  During 2004, we increased company driver and
IC compensation in order to attract and retain an adequate supply of qualified
drivers.  While we have, to date, not
experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages, we
expect costs to recruit, train and retain company
drivers and ICs will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.


Revenue Equipment

As of December 31, 2004, we operated 10,151 company-controlled
tractors.  In addition, our 1,301
contracted ICs operate their own tractors, but transport freight in our
trailing equipment.  We operate with
standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible, particularly in our JBT
and JBI fleets.  Based on customer
preference and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is more
diversified.  We believe operating with
relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts
quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense. 
At December 31, 2004, the average age of our combined tractor fleet was
2.0 years, our trailers were 4.1 years old and our containers were 6.4 years
old.  We perform routine servicing and
preventative maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal
facilities.

We typically operate newer revenue equipment in our JBT segment to
minimize downtime and maximize utilization. 
However, during 2003, the age of our JBT tractor fleet increased,
primarily due to our decision to delay trades. 
Our JBI segment utilizes high-cube containers, which can be separated
from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars.  We are currently in the process of expanding
our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet.  The composition of our DCS trailing fleet
varies with specific customer requirements and may include dry-vans, flatbeds,
temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, or even straight trucks.

Effective October 1, 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
required that most newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines comply with
certain new emission standards.  In
November 2002, we ordered approximately 2,100 new tractors, primarily for our
JBI and DCS fleets, which were equipped with Mercedes engines.  These engines were exempt from the EPA’s
October 1, 2002, rules.  Except for these
new tractors, which were utilized primarily for local and regional operations,
we limited our new tractor purchases while we tested a limited number of the
new engines.  In late 2003, we commenced
receiving new tractors with the 2002 EPA-compliant engines.  At December 31, 2004, approximately 4,870 of
our company-controlled fleet consisted of tractors with these compliant
engines.  In addition to higher initial
purchase prices, these tractors also experience an approximate 3% to 5%
reduction in fuel efficiency.  We are
uncertain if future maintenance costs will be higher, on the average, for these
tractors as they age.  We do anticipate
continued increases in tractor ownership costs and fuel costs as regular
replacements and additions increase the percentage of our fleet with these
newer engines.  In addition higher
worldwide steel prices have resulted in increased acquisition costs for new
revenue equipment.  A new set of proposed
fuel-emission standards mandated by the EPA is expected to become effective in
2007.  We are unable to predict the
impact these proposed standards will have on our future operations and
financial results.

Competition

According to the American Trucking Associations (ATA), all modes of
domestic freight carriers in the United States generated approximately $610
billion of revenue in 2003.  Of this
total, truck transportation represented about 87%, or $531 billion.  ATA also estimated that approximately 54% of
the nation’s 2003 truck revenue related to for-hire carriers, while 46% related
to private carriers.  As of July 2004,
there were more than 573,000 private, for-hire, U.S. Mail and
other U.S. interstate motor carriers on file with the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Administration (FMCSA). 
The top ten for-hire truck-load carriers only generate about 3% of the
total revenue in this segment, and we represent approximately 1% of this
segment’s revenue.  The market in which
we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented
and includes thousands of carriers, many of which are very small.  While we compete with a number of smaller
carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent
competition in all markets across the country.

Regulation

Our operations as a for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and certain business is also
subject to state rules and regulations. 
The DOT periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our
compliance with all federal safety requirements, and we report certain accident
and other information to the DOT.  Our
operations into and out of Canada and Mexico are also subject to regulation by
those countries.


Effective January 4, 2004, the FMCSA, which is a separate
administration within the DOT, changed the regulations that govern driver hours
of service.  These new rules were the
most significant changes to driver hours of service in more than 40 years.  In general, the new rules allow a driver to
drive for up to 11 consecutive hours, instead of 10, but require 10 hours of
off-duty time, rather than 8, and reduce the total number of driving hours to
14 in a 24-hour period, compared to 15 under the old rules.  In addition, more off-duty “sleeper berth”
time is required before on-duty time is allowed.  In July 2004, the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the new hours-of-service (HOS)
rules, which had been newly effective in January 2004.  The Court’s rejection was based on concerns
regarding driver’s health, as well as other issues such as driving time, rest
periods and monitoring compliance.  In
September 2004, the current HOS rules were extended for one year or the time at
which FMCSA develops a set of new rules. 
In February 2005, the Bush administration proposed legislation that
would convert the current HOS regulations into statutory law, a move that would
keep the current rules in effect despite the Court of Appeals action to
overturn them.  We cannot predict the
final resolution of this rules action. 
However, if the current HOS rules remain in effect, we do not anticipate
a significant adverse effect on our operations or earnings.

PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas.  We occupy a number of buildings in Lowell
which we utilize for administrative support, data center, primary customer
service and freight dispatch.  We maintain
a backup data center for disaster recovery, maintenance shop and driver operations
facility in Lowell.  In June 2004, we
commenced construction of a new, approximate 110,000 square foot office
building located adjacent to our existing corporate office in Lowell, Arkansas.  We anticipate occupying this new building
during the third quarter of 2005.  We
also own or lease other significant facilities where we perform maintenance on
our equipment, provide bulk fuel and employ personnel to support
operations.  In addition to our principal
properties listed below, we lease a number of small offices and parking yards
throughout the country which support our customers’ business needs.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK AND
RELATED SECURITY HOLDER MATTERS

Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market under the
symbol “JBHT.”  The following table sets
forth, for the calendar years indicated, the range of high and low sales prices
for our common stock as reported by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotations National Market System (NASDAQ).  The following sales prices all reflect a
two-for-one stock split paid on August 29, 2003.

On January 31, 2005, the high and low sales prices for our common stock
as reported by the NASDAQ were $44.18 and $42.52, respectively. As of January
31, 2005, we had 1,324 stockholders of record.

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of
our common stock.  We did not repurchase
any of our common stock during the years 2002 through 2004.  As previously announced in December 2004, our
Board authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of our common stock during
the next year.  We commenced repurchases
of our common stock in January 2005.

Dividend Policy

We paid quarterly dividends during calendar year 1999 and in a number
of years prior to 1999.  In early 2000,
we announced a decision to discontinue dividend payments.  In April 2004, we re-initiated a quarterly
cash dividend of $.03 per share.  This
re-initiation was based on our lower debt levels and improving cash flows.  We also paid a cash dividend of $.03 per
share in July and October 2004.  In
December 2004, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from
$.03 to $.12.  Our first $.12 per share
dividend was paid on February 18, 2005, to stockholders of record on January
31, 2005.  We currently intend to continue
paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. 
However, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid,
since such payments are dependent on earnings, cash flows and other factors.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The
following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition
should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes

YEAR IN REVIEW

Our financial
results for calendar year 2004 represented the third consecutive year of record
revenues and earnings driven by strong performance from each of our
segments.  Our 2004 net earnings of
$146.3 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, were up 53% over the $95.4 million,
or $1.17 per diluted share, earned in 2003. 
While each of our three business segments contributed to our higher
levels of profitability, the increase in operating income in the JBT segment
was most evident.  A significant part of
the increased JBT operating income in 2004 was a result of our continued focus
on capacity management.  Capacity
management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight to determine
whether business which is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by
different business with better margins. 
We also are continuing to analyze our business to ensure we are charging
for all services provided.  Primarily due
to our capacity management actions and rate increases required to offset
certain non-fuel cost increases, our 2004 JBT segment revenue per loaded mile,
excluding fuel surcharges (FSC), rose 8.7% over 2003.

During 2004,
we also focused on revenue per load, revenue per mile and revenue per tractor
per day in our JBI and DCS business segments. 
Primarily due to our focus on rate increases and capacity management, we
were able to increase 2004 revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, by 3.4% in
our JBI segment and net revenue per tractor per week by 6.0% in our DCS
segment.  These increases significantly
contributed to our higher net earnings in 2004.

Our increase
in consolidated 2004 net earnings was also a result of significantly lower
insurance, claims and workers’ compensation costs.  We have continued to ingrain safety into our
company culture and ask each of our drivers and other employees to make safety
a daily priority.  Our 2004 combined
insurance claims and workers’ compensation expense declined approximately $23
million from 2003 and increased our current year earnings per diluted share by
approximately $.13.

Our 2004
consolidated operating ratio (operating expenses divided by total operating
revenues) was 88.9%, compared with 92.4% in 2003 and 95.5% in 2002.  The current year was the first time in over
ten years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below
90%.  We also paid off all of our
remaining balance sheet debt and capital lease obligations in 2004.  We re-initiated paying a quarterly cash
dividend in early 2004 and in December 2004, increased our quarterly dividend
from $.03 to $.12 per share and announced plans to repurchase up to $100 million
of our common stock.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of
our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes.  Therefore, the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these
estimates.  We evaluate these estimates
on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.  Any
effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting
from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in
which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.


We consider our
critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make
more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial
statements and include the following:

Workers’
Compensation and Accident Costs

We purchase
insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries
(workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo
claims.  Most insurance arrangements
include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each
claim, but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic
claim costs that are completely insured. 
The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain
measurement dates and policy expiration dates. 
During 2004, we were self-insured for a portion of our claims exposure
resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, workers’
compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for auto
accidents and $1 million for workers’ compensation claims.  These same levels of self-insurance are in
effect for 2005.

Our claims accrual
policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of
the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims,
analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal,
economic and regulatory factors.  Our
safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the
insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each
claim.  The ultimate cost of a claim develops
over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing and extent of
damages claimed becomes available. 
Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim
information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability.  This process involves the use of loss-
development factors based on our historical claims experience.  In doing so, the recorded ultimate liability
considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for
incurred-but-not-reported claims.  We do
not discount our estimated losses.  At
December 31, 2004, we had approximately $19 million of estimated net claims
payable.  In addition, we are required to
pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2004, we had a prepaid
insurance asset of approximately $58 million, which represented pre-funded
claims and premiums.  We are also
substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased
revenue equipment.

Revenue
Equipment

We operate a significant number of tractors, trailers and containers in
connection with our business.  This
equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease
agreements.  In addition, we may rent
revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short-term
rental arrangements.  Revenue equipment
which is purchased is depreciated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  Equipment acquired under capital leases is
initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and
amortized on the straight-line method over the lease term or the estimated
useful life, whichever is shorter.  We
had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at December 31, 2004.

We have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed
residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment acquired since 1999.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, we
reviewed the useful lives and salvage values of our tractor fleet.  We have utilized the guaranteed trade-in
values as well as other operational information, such as anticipated annual
miles, in accounting for purchased and leased tractors.  If our tractor supplier was unable to perform
under the terms of our agreement for guaranteed trade-in values, it could have
a materially negative impact on our financial results.  We periodically review the useful lives and
salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for
impairment.  We have not identified any impairments to our existing assets.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight
transported.  Accordingly, a portion of
the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered
is recognized in each reporting


period

based on the percentage of the
freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the
reporting period.

Segments

We operated three segments during calendar year 2004.  The operation of each of these businesses is
described in footnote (11).  The
following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2004 Compared With 2003

Overview of 2004

Our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2004 totaled a record
$146 million. This compares with our previous record net earnings of $95
million in 2003.  Diluted earnings per
share were $1.75 in 2004, also a record number, compared with $1.17 in
2003.  The average number of diluted
shares outstanding in 2004 was approximately 2% higher than the comparable
number in 2003.  Consolidated operating
revenues were $2.79 billion in 2004, an increase of 14% over the $2.43 billion
in 2003.


Each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial
results in 2004.  While the overall
economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2004,
a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings.  We have continued our focus on capacity
management, as well as individual load and lane profitability.  A number of new proprietary technology tools
and increased management focus have allowed us to reduce the amount of
unprofitable lanes and freight, and to properly charge for equipment and
services provided to customers.  In
addition, the levels of available capacity in the industry have been reduced by
significant increases in insurance, fuel, equipment and driver compensation
costs.  The availability of qualified
drivers has also limited carriers’ ability to expand the size of their fleets.

JBT Segment

JBT segment gross
revenue was $928 million in 2004, up 10% over the $841 million in 2003.  Higher fuel surcharge (FSC) revenue in 2004
impacted this comparison.  If the amount
of FSC revenue was excluded from both years, 2004 JBT segment revenue rose 7.9%
over 2003.  The average tractor count in
2004 declined 3.1% from 2003.  However,
revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, was 8.7% above 2003, offsetting the
decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing operating income.  Current year revenue growth was also up
approximately 2% from outsourced freight activity.

Operating income
of the JBT segment rose to $103 million in 2004, from $49 million in 2003.  The significant increase in revenue per
loaded mile, excluding FSC, accounted for the majority of this operating income
improvement.  In addition, lower JBT
accident and workers’ compensation costs positively impacted current year
operating income.

JBI Segment

JBI segment gross
revenue grew by 19%, to $1,115 million in 2004, from $936 million in 2003.  Higher FSC revenue in 2004 impacted this
comparison.  If FSC revenue was excluded
from both years, 2004 JBI segment revenue increased 15.8% over 2003.  A significant portion of this revenue growth
was driven by a 10.3% increase in loads. 
Revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, was 3.4% above 2003 levels.  The remaining portion of revenue growth was
primarily a result of freight mix changes.

Operating income
in the JBI segment increased to $131 million in 2004 from $91 million in
2003.  The increase in current year JBI
operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded
mile, excluding FSC, increased load volume and lower revenue equipment
ownership costs, partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation
expenses.

DCS Segment

DCS segment
revenue grew over 13% to $760 million in 2004 from $671 in 2003.  The higher level of FSC revenue in 2004
impacted this comparison.  If FSC revenue
was excluded from both years, 2004 DCS segment revenue rose 10% over 2003.  The average number of trucks in the dedicated
fleet increased nearly 5% in 2004.  The
additional revenue growth in the current year was primarily a result of a 6%
increase in net revenue per tractor.

Operating income
increased 65% to $75 million in 2004 versus $45 million in 2003.  During 2004, we have conducted reviews of our
underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either
improve margins or redeploy assets.  We
have also implemented cost controls and raised rates as appropriate.  These efforts have improved our DCS segment
operating ratio to 90.2% in 2004 from 93.3% in 2003.


The following
table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a
percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of
those items as compared with the prior year.

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Total operating
expenses increased 10.2% in 2004 over 2003, while operating revenues increased
14.5%.  The combination of the change in
these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 350 basis
points to 88.9% in 2004, from 92.4% in 2003. 
As previously mentioned, increases in revenue per loaded mile, excluding
fuel surcharges, and lower casualty and workers’ compensation claims costs were
two of the more significant factors driving these changes.  We also increased the number of ICs in our
JBT and DCS fleets to 1,301 at December 31, 2004, from 994 at the end of 2003.  When we replace company-operated tractors and
driver employees with ICs, certain costs such as salaries, wages, employee
benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation
increase.

The expense
category of salaries, wages and employee benefits declined to 29.8% of revenue
in 2004 from 32.5% in 2003 and the total expense dollars only increased 4.8%
from 2003, compared with the 14.5% increase in revenue.  While we did increase compensation levels for
many of our drivers in 2004, these increases were partly offset by lower
workers’ compensation costs.  The number
of company drivers at December 31, 2004 was approximately equal to the number
at the end of 2003.  The 16.6% increase
in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional funds
paid to railroads and drayage companies, related to JBI business growth, and to
the continued expansion of our IC fleets.

Fuel cost per
gallon was approximately 21% higher in 2004 over 2003.  This increase in fuel costs and slightly
lower fuel efficiency accounted for the 24.2% increase in fuel costs.  We have fuel surcharge programs in place with
the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively
quickly when fuel costs change.  If fuel
costs change rapidly, we may experience some financial impact from timing
differences between financial reporting periods.  We were able to recover substantially all of
our increased fuel costs experienced in


calendar

year 2004.  We currently have no contract
or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs.

The significant
decline in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to lower accident and
claims experience in 2004.  As mentioned
above, we have made safety a primary focus item throughout our entire
organization.  The category of general
and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting and testing, legal and
professional fees and bad debt expense. 
Gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified
in the general and administrative category. 
We experienced a net gain of approximately $402,000 on revenue equipment
and other dispositions in 2004, compared with a $1.1 million loss in 2003.

Our net interest
expense declined to $5.5 million in 2004 from $17.2 million in 2003.  We were able to continue reducing our debt
and capitalized lease obligations during 2004 and paid off all our remaining
balance sheet debt and capital leases as of December 31, 2004.  Our continued improvement in net earnings and
strong cash flow allowed us to pay off this debt.  Our effective income tax rate was 51.6% in
2004, compared with 43.1% in 2003. 
Income tax expense in 2004 reflects a contingent tax liability of $33.6
million, including accrued interest expense, related to certain sale-leaseback
transactions that closed in 1999.  Income
tax expense in 2003 reflected the reversal of $7.7 million of non-cash tax
benefits taken in early 2003, related to these sale-leaseback transactions.  See Risk Factors for additional information
on this matter.  Our 2004 and 2003 income
tax rates are also higher than statutory federal and state rates, primarily due
to our driver per diem plan.  This plan
generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the Company.  However, it does result in an increase in our
effective income tax rates.

We expect our effective income tax rate to be 38.5% for the calendar
year 2005.

The “Equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated
statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for
Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  Effective
January 1, 2003, we increased our interest in TPI to approximately 37%, from
27% in 2002. JBHT’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate $5.3
million investment in TPI since we have not made any additional commitments or
guaranteed any of TPI’s financial obligations.

2003 Compared With 2002

Overview of 2003

Our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2003 totaled $95
million, after reversing $7.7 million of non-cash tax benefits, which resulted
from a sale-and-leaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment.  This compares with our previous record net
earnings of $52 million in 2002.  Diluted
earnings per share were $1.17 in 2003, also a record number, compared with
$0.66 in 2002.  The average number of
diluted shares outstanding in 2003 was approximately 5% higher than the
comparable number in 2002.  Consolidated
operating revenues were $2.43 billion in 2003, an increase of 8% over the $2.25
billion in 2002.

Each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial
results in 2003.  While the overall
economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2003,
a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings.  We continued our focus on capacity management,
as well as individual load and lane profitability.  A number of new proprietary technology tools
and increased management focus allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable
lanes and freight, and to properly charge for equipment and services provided
to customers.  In addition, significant
increases in certain operating costs, such as insurance, fuel and equipment,
reduced the level of capacity available in the industry.

JBT Segment

JBT segment gross
revenue was $841 million in 2003, up 2% over the $827 million in 2002.  Higher fuel prices in 2003 and the resulting
increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue
growth.  The average tractor count in
2003 was down nearly 3% from 2002. 
However, revenue per loaded mile,


excluding

fuel surcharges, rose 5.2% in 2003, more than offsetting the decline in the
size of the fleet and enhancing operating income.

Operating income
of the JBT segment rose to $49 million in 2003, from $27 million in 2002.  In addition to the higher revenue per mile,
we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement
plan (driver per diem plan) in early 2003. 
This new plan benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased
operating income.

JBI Segment

JBI segment gross
revenue grew by 16%, to $936 million in 2003, from $809 million in 2002.  Revenue growth was due, in part, to a strong
demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated an 11%
increase in number of loads year over year. 
Freight mix changes also played an important role that led to improved
revenue per load.

Operating income
in the JBI segment increased to $91 million in 2003 from $55 million in
2002.  The JBI segment operating ratio
improved by 300 basis points to 90.3% for 2003, compared to 93.3% for
2002.  These improved financial results
were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding
incremental containers, improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and
a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality.

DCS Segment

DCS segment
revenue grew approximately 7% to $671 million in 2003 from $628 in 2002.  Revenue, net of purchased transportation and
fuel surcharge revenue increased 5%.  The
increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit’s average tractor count
for 2003 declined approximately 1%, compared to 2002.  More than offsetting the decline in the
tractor fleet was a nearly 6% improvement in revenue (excluding fuel surcharge)
per tractor per day.  Driving this
increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of 7% and increased
focus on backhaul opportunities.

Operating income
increased 130% to $45 million in 2003 versus $20 million in 2002.  At the end of 2002, we began analyzing a
number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy
assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the
segment’s assets.  At the same time, cost
controls were implemented to improve operating results at all accounts.  The success of these efforts improved the
operating ratio by 360 basis points, to 93.3% in 2003.  Cost reductions in driver pay, salary and
office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced 2003 operating
income.  A decline of 16% in the average
age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing
commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment’s insurance
and claims costs.  We also incurred
certain new start-up costs in 2002 associated with several large accounts that
did not impact 2003.  Revenue growth will
continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer
opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment
of additional assets.


The following
table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a
percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of
those items as compared with the prior year.

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Total operating
expenses increased 4.7% in 2003 over 2002, while operating revenues increased
8.3%.  The combination of the change in
these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 310 basis
points to 92.4% in 2003, from 95.5% in 2002. 
As previously mentioned, increases in revenue per loaded mile, excluding
fuel surcharges, and the implementation of a driver per-diem plan were two of
the more significant factors driving these changes.  We also increased the number of independent
contractors (ICs) in our JBT fleet to 994 at December 31, 2003, from 679 at the
end of 2002.  When we replace
company-operated tractors and driver employees with ICs, certain costs such as
salaries, wages, employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as
purchased transportation increase.

Fuel cost per
gallon was approximately 13% higher in 2003 over 2002.  However, we have fuel surcharge programs in
place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges
relatively quickly when fuel costs change.  If fuel costs change rapidly we may experience
some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting
periods when fuel costs change more quickly than our compensating fuel
surcharges.  We recovered through our
fuel surcharge programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs
experienced in calendar year 2003.  We
currently have no contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in
fuel costs.  Insurance and claims costs
rose during 2003, primarily due to higher premium costs.  While our accident frequency declined in
2003, severity, or the cost per accident, increased over 2002.  General and administrative


expenses

include driver recruiting and testing, bad debts and professional service fees,
all of which increased in 2003.  Gains
and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general
and administrative category.  We had a
net loss of approximately $1.1 million on equipment and other dispositions in
2003, compared with a $1.8 million loss in 2002.  These losses were primarily a result of
revenue equipment which was lost or written off.

Our net interest
expense declined to $17.2 million in 2003, from $24.8 million in 2002.  We were able to reduce our total debt levels
to $172 million as of December 31, 2003, from $343 million at the end of
2002.  This reduced debt level was
primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in 2003 and proceeds from
a secondary stock offering which closed in mid-2002.  Our effective income tax rate increased to
43.1% in 2003, from 30.8% in 2002.  This
higher tax rate was primarily due to our increased level of earnings, the
driver-per diem plan and a reversal of a $7.7 million non-cash tax benefit
taken in 2003 related to certain sale-leaseback transactions that closed in
1999.  As previously mentioned, we
implemented a driver per-diem pay plan in early 2003.  This plan generates net benefits to most of
our eligible drivers and to the Company. 
However, it does result in an increase in our effective income tax
rate.  The $7.7 million reversal of tax
benefits was retroactive to January 1, 2003, and related to a proposed
adjustment by the IRS that would disallow the tax benefits associated with a
series of sale-and-leaseback transactions, which occurred in 1999.  This issue is discussed in further detail
under “Risk Factors.”

The “Equity in
loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings
reflects our share of the operating results for Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  Effective January 1, 2003, we increased our
interest in TPI to approximately 37%, from 27% in 2002.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Cash Flow

We generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities.  Net cash provided by operating activities was
$394 million in 2004, $333 million in 2003 and $174 million in 2002.  Part of the increase in net cash provided
from 2002 through 2004 was a result of our continued improvement in net
earnings.  Increases in net cash provided
have also resulted from deferred income taxes, tax benefits of stock options
exercised and higher levels of accrued payroll and other accrued expenses.  Some of the significant changes in the trade
accounts payable balances which appear on our consolidated statement of cash
flows in 2002 through 2004 were a result of timing differences among years of
insurance-related payments.  Cash flows
used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions
from our fleet of revenue equipment.  The
higher level of cash used in investing activities during 2004 was due to
delayed tractor purchases in early 2003 while we were still testing the new
EPA-compliant engines and our decision in late 2003 to commence purchasing
tractors that were under capital lease arrangements.  We paid $60.8 million in 2004 to purchase
tractors which were previously under capital lease programs.  At December 31, 2004, we have no revenue
equipment on capital leases.  In 2004, we
also purchased approximately $5.9 million of intermodal trailing equipment that
had been under operating lease programs.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2003 and 2004 reflects
payments of our remaining debt and capital lease obligations.  Our improving cash flows allowed us to close
calendar year 2004 with no balance sheet debt and no capital lease
obligations.  In addition, we
re-initiated the payment of a cash dividend in early 2004 and, in December
2004, announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.12 from $.03
per share.  We also announced, in
December 2004, our intent to purchase up to $100 million of our common stock
during the next year.


Selected Balance Sheet Data

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of
our common stock.  We did not repurchase
any of our common stock during the years 2002 through 2004.  As previously mentioned, the Board, in
December 2004, authorized the purchase of up to $100 million of our common
stock during the next year.  We commenced
repurchases of our common stock in January 2005.

Liquidity

Our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of
revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older
revenue equipment with new, late-model equipment.  We are frequently able to accelerate or
postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market
conditions.  We have obtained capital
through a secondary common stock offering, revolving lines of credit and cash
generated from operations.  We have also
periodically utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue
equipment.

We utilized capital leases to acquire certain tractors in 2000 and
2001.  Since late 2001, we have been
acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and
anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future.  We are currently committed to spend
approximately $189 million, net of expected proceeds from sale or trade-in
allowances, on revenue equipment and construction of new facilities.

We are authorized to borrow up to $150 million under our current
revolving line of credit, which expires November 14, 2005.  We had no balances outstanding on this line
at December 31, 2004.  While we do
anticipate some need to borrow on our revolver during 2005, we believe that our
liquid assets, cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will
provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the
foreseeable future.  Our revolving line
of credit does not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or
amounts due under the agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no
remaining capitalized leases at December 31, 2004.  Our only off-balance sheet arrangements are
related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data
processing equipment and facilities.  As
of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 20,300 trailers and 5,100
containers/chassis that were subject to operating leases, and we had
approximately $151 million of obligations remaining under these leases.  Our standby letters of credit are also not
recorded on our books at December 31, 2004, since there were no balances
outstanding at that time under these arrangements.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to
general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is
dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on
the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include significant increases
or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry,
surpluses in the market for used equipment, interest rates, fuel taxes, license
and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, and
difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent
contractors.

We are also
affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business
cycles, particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and
manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions may adversely affect our
customers and their ability to pay for our services.  Customers encountering adverse economic
conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to
increase our reserve for bad-debt losses. 
In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal
factors.  Customers tend to reduce
shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to
be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather, which causes
higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.


We operate in a highly
competitive and fragmented industry. 
Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current
profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets.

Some of these
factors include:

•

We compete with many other
truck-load carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with
less-than-truck-load carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment
and greater capital resources than we do.

•

Some of our competitors
periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during
times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to
maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins.

•

Many customers reduce the
number of carriers they use by selecting so-called “core carriers” as approved
transportation service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.

•

Many customers periodically
accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process
may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to
competitors.

•

Certain of our customers
that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to
expand their operations.

•

The trend toward
consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with
greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their
size.

•

Advances in technology
require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not
be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these
investments.

We derive a significant portion
of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

For the calendar
year ended December 31, 2004, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted
for approximately 42% of our revenue. 
Our largest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately
15% of our total revenue in 2004. 
Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers, and we
cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize our
services or that they will continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our services
by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.

We depend on third parties in the
operation of our business.

Our Intermodal
business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation
services.  These services are provided
pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads.  While we have agreements with various Class I
railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern Railroad. 
The inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a
material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  We also utilize the services of a number of
third-party dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and
destination pickups and deliveries.  In
addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States
through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts.


We are currently engaged in an
arbitration process with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad to
clarify certain financial and operating terms in our Joint Service Agreement
(JSA).

As previously
reported, we are currently engaged in an arbitration process with the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railroad to clarify certain financial and
operating terms in our Joint Service Agreement (JSA).  BNSF provides a significant amount of rail
transportation services to our JBI business segment.  The JSA is an agreement between BNSF and us,
which was signed in 1996, and defines a number of financial and operating
arrangements relative to our intermodal business.  The JSA specifies arbitration as the method
of resolving disagreements if a mediation process does not result in
resolution.  We were unable to resolve
our differences with BNSF through mediation during the second quarter of 2004.

The current
arbitration process commenced on July 7, 2004. 
According to the JSA, any amounts due us or payable to BNSF, determined
through the arbitration process, could be retroactive to July 7, 2004.  Both parties have continued to exchange and
analyze data during late 2004 and early 2005. 
Formal arbitration proceedings are currently scheduled for April and May
2005.  At this time, we are unable to
reasonably predict the outcome of this process and, as such, no gain or loss
contingency can be determined or recorded. 
Normal commercial business activity between the parties, including load
tendering, load tracing, billing and payments, continues on a timely basis.

Difficulty in attracting drivers
could affect our profitability and ability to grow.

Periodically, the
trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and
retaining qualified drivers, including ICs. 
A shortage of qualified company drivers and ICs has proven to be
particularly severe during 2003 and 2004. 
In spite of significant increases in driver compensation and recruiting
costs, the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage of
drivers.  If we are unable to continue to
attract an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent
contractors, we could be required to significantly increase our driver
compensation package or let trucks sit idle, which could adversely affect our
growth and profitability.

Ongoing insurance and claims
expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.

Our future
insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could
reduce our earnings. During 2004, we self-insured a portion of our claims
exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage and health
claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for auto accidents and $1 million
for workers’ compensation.  These
deductible limits are the same for 2005. 
If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured
increases, our operating results could be adversely affected.  Also, we maintain insurance above the amounts
for which we self-insure with licensed insurance companies.  Insurance carriers have recently raised
premiums for most trucking companies.  As
a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our
current coverages expire on July 31, 2005. 
If these expenses increase, and we are unable to offset the increase
with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely
affected.

The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale-
and-leaseback transactions.

In 1999, we entered into
a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our
Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately
$175 million.  This transaction was
examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 tax returns.  In December 2003, we received an IRS Notice
of Proposed Assessment which disallows the tax benefits associated with these
transactions, and as a result, we have filed an appeal in the matter.  We have had preliminary discussions with the
IRS Appeals Division and have been informed that the IRS Examination Division
has been instructed to prepare additional work since their case had not been
developed adequately for the appellate hearing. 
To date, we have not been contacted by the IRS Examination Division to
provide any additional information for their review.  If a resolution of the matter cannot be
reached in the appeals process, the IRS will forward a 90 day letter, also
known as a Notice of Deficiency. A resolution of the dispute could occur at any
point in the administrative process or could extend through a trial and


court appeals.  If we are
unsuccessful in defending this transaction, we could owe additional taxes and
interest.  In 2003, after receiving the
IRS Notice of Proposed Assessment and reviewing applicable accounting
literature, we reversed the 2003 expected non-cash tax benefits of
approximately $7.7 million recognized during 2003, and suspended any further
recognition of the benefit.  Based on events
occurring subsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for a
contingent tax liability of $33.6 million, including accrued interest expense,
which represents all previous tax benefits recognized on these transactions.  The liability for this contingency is
included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as a long-term
liability.  We continue to believe our
tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and
opinions from our external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering
into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS
position using all administrative and legal processes available.  If the IRS were successful in disallowing
100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the total ultimate impact on
liquidity could be approximately $44 million, excluding interest.

Our operations are subject to
various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result
in substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to
various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of
hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and
retention of storm water.  We operate in
industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are
located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination
have occurred.  Our operations involve
the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous wastes
disposal, among others.  We also maintain
bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If we are involved in a spill or other
accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation
of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.  If
we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be
subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

We operate in a highly regulated
industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or
liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

The U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) and various state agencies exercise broad
powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization
to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial
reporting.  We are audited periodically
by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety,
hours-of-service and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the
DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.

Effective January
4, 2004, the FMCSA, an administration within the DOT, changed the regulations
that govern driver hours of service.  As
previously described, these new rules generally allow a driver to drive for up
to 11 consecutive hours, rather than 10, but require 10 hours of off-duty time,
rather than 8.  In addition, more
off-duty “sleeper berth” time is required before on-duty time is allowed.  The United States Court of Appeals issued a
decision in July 2004, rejecting these new hours-of-service (HOS) rules.  The Court’s rejection was based on concerns
regarding drivers’ health, as well as other issues.  On September 30, 2004, the current HOS rules
were extended for one year or the time at which the FMCSA develops a set of new
rules.  On February 7, 2005, the Bush
administration proposed legislation that would convert the current HOS regulations
into statutory law, a move that would keep the current rules in effect despite
the Court of Appeals action to overturn them.

As part of a 1998
consent decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a number of
heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions
from their engines produced subsequent to October 1, 2002.  In November 2002, we ordered approximately
2,100 new tractors, primarily for our JBI and DCS fleets, which were equipped
with Mercedes engines.  These engines
were exempt from the EPA’s October 2002 rules. 
In late 2003, after extensive testing, we commenced receiving new
tractors with the 2002 EPA-compliant engines. 
At December 31, 2004, we operated approximately 2,100 tractors with the
Mercedes engines and about 4,870 tractors with the 2002 EPA-compliant
engines.  In addition to higher initial
purchase prices, these new tractors have also experienced an average 3% to 5%
reduction in fuel efficiency.  We are
uncertain if future maintenance costs will be higher, on the average, for these
two groups of tractors as they


age.  We do
anticipate continued increases in ownership and fuel costs as regular
replacement and fleet addition tractors increase the percentage of our fleet
with the EPA-compliant units.  A new set
of proposed fuel-emission standards mandated by the EPA is expected to become
effective in 2007.  We are unable to
predict the impact these proposed standards will have on our future operations
and financial results.

Rapid changes in fuel costs can
impact our periodic financial results.

Fuel and fuel
taxes currently represent our third-largest general expense category.  During the past three years, fuel cost per
gallon has varied significantly, with prices at times changing as much as $.10
to $.15 per gallon between consecutive months. 
We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of
our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher
fuel costs.  Most of these programs
automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differences
between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed
to our customers.  In addition, we incur
additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to
our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out-of-route miles
that cannot be billed to customers. 
Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material
adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2004, we had no derivative
financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.

We have a $1.7 million account
receivable from Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM) related to the sale of
our share of a Mexican joint venture.

As previously
mentioned, we sold our joint venture interest in Mexico to TMM during the first
quarter of 2002 for $22.5 million.  We
have received $18.0 million in principal and interest payments on this
note.  At December 31, 2004, we had a
$1.7 million account receivable from TMM. 
We expect to receive these remaining funds during the first quarter of
2005.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised FASB Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.  Interpretation No. 46(R) addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest
entities.  For public entities that are
not small business issuers, the provisions of Interpretation No. 46(R) are
effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after
March 15, 2004.  If the variable interest
entity is considered to be a special-purpose entity, Interpretation No. 46(R)
shall be applied no later than the first reporting period that ends after
December 15, 2003.  The adoption of this
Interpretation did not have any material effect on our financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets

.  This Statement amends
the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

.  APB 29 provided
an exception to the basic measurement principle (fair value) for exchanges of
similar assets, requiring that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a
carryover basis.  SFAS 153 eliminates the
exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have
commercial substance, that is, transactions that are not expected to result in
significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity.  The provisions of SFAS 153 are effective for
exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005.  As of December 31, 2004,
we believe that SFAS 153 will have no significant effect on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.   SFAS No. 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No.
123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
and supersedes APB 25.  Among other
items, SFAS 123(R) eliminates the use of APB 25 and intrinsic value method of
accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services
received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date
fair value of those awards, in the financial statements.  In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the cost
will be based on the grant-date fair value of the award and will be recognized
over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in
exchange for the award.  For public
entities that do not file as


small business issuers, the provisions of the revised statement are to
be applied prospectively for awards that are granted, modified, or settled in
the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005.  When we adopt the standard on July 1, 2005,
we will be required to report in our financial statements the share-based
compensation expense for the last six months of 2005 and may adopt it using the
modified-prospective method effective July 1, 2005.  We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS
No. 123(R) will have on us and based on our preliminary analysis, expect to
report approximately $2.3 million of additional compensation expense during the
period July 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005, as a result of this new
accounting standard.

ITEM 7a

.  
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term debt. We from time to
time have utilized interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes;  none were outstanding at
December 31, 2004.  Risk can be estimated
by measuring the impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in short-term
market interest rates.  If short-term
market interest rates average 10% more during the next 12 months, there would
be no material adverse impact on our results of operations based on the fact
that we had no variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004.  At December 31, 2004, we also had no
long-term debt obligations outstanding.

Although we conduct business in foreign countries,
international operations are not material to our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Additionally, foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not
material to our results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2004.  Accordingly, we are not currently
subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that
exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or
on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment.  To date, we have not entered into any foreign
currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments
to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The price and availability of diesel fuel are subject
to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production,
seasonality, weather and other market factors. 
Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price
increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges.  We cannot predict the extent to which high
fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel
surcharges could be collected to offset such increases.  As of December 31, 2004, we had no derivative
financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2004.  These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of J. B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated March 11, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.:

We have audited
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that J. B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on COSO.  Also, in our opinion, J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on COSO.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 11, 2005, expressed
an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

J. B. HUNT TRANSPORT SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002

(1)

Business

J. B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. (JBHT or we), together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, are
one of the largest truck-load transportation and logistics companies in North
America.  We directly transport or
arrange for the transportation of full truck-load, containerizable freight,
while operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation
and various state regulatory agencies.

(2)

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

(A)

Basis of
Consolidation

JBHT’s
consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and those of
our wholly owned subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(B)

Use of
Estimates

The
consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.  The preparation of
these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that directly
affect the amounts reported in such statements and accompanying notes.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing
basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and using other
methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, our actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.

We
believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more significance
in our financial statement preparation process than others.  We believe the most critical accounting
policies and estimates include the economic useful lives and salvage values of
our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of
exposures under our insurance and claims plans, and various other recorded or
disclosed amounts.  To the extent that
actual, final outcomes are different than our estimates, or additional facts
and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that
accounting period will be affected.

(C)

Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior periods to conform to current
presentations.

(D)

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

(E)

Tires in
Service

We
capitalize tires placed in service on new revenue equipment as a part of the
equipment cost.  Replacement tires and
costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in
service.


(F)

Property
and Equipment

Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of 3 to 15 years for revenue and service equipment, 10
to 40 years for structures and improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture and
office equipment.

Property
and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum
lease payments and amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the
shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.

(G)

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue based on relative transit time in each reporting period with
expenses recognized as incurred.

(H)

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(I)

Earnings
Per Share

A
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings
per share is shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):


Options
to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding during each year, but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares, are shown in the table below.

On July 17, 2003, we announced a
two-for-one stock split on our common stock, payable August 29, 2003, to
stockholders of record on July 31, 2003. 
All references in our financial statements and report on Form 10-K with
regard to number of shares and the per share amounts have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect this stock split.

(J)

Credit
Risk

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk,
consist primarily of trade receivables. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited due to our large number of customers and the diverse range of
industries they represent.  As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had no significant concentrations of credit
risk.

(K)

Foreign
Currency Translation

Local
currencies are generally considered the functional currencies outside the
United States.  Assets and liabilities
are translated at year-end exchange rates for operations in local currency
environments.  Income and expense items
are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Foreign
currency translation adjustments, which reflect foreign currency exchange rate
changes applicable to the net assets of the Mexican operations, have been
recorded as a separate item of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2001. 
This investment was sold during 2002.

(L)

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
have adopted the intrinsic value based method of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in accounting for
compensation costs for our stock option plans. 
Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized on the date of grant
only if the current market price of the underlying common stock at date of
grant exceeds the exercise price.

Had we determined
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for our stock
options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
our net earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
below:


Pro forma net earnings
reflects only options granted since December 31, 1995.  Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation costs for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the
pro forma net earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is
reflected over the options’ vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation cost
for options granted prior to January 1, 1996, is not considered.

The per share
weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002
was $21.99, $12.90 and $7.26, respectively, on the date of grant using the
Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:  2004 - expected dividend
yield 1.08%, volatility of 55.6%, risk-free interest rate of 2.19% and an
expected life of 6.6 years;  2003 -
expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 57.4%, risk-free interest rate of
1.53%, and an expected life of 6.3 years; 
2002 - expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 54.9%, risk-free
interest rate of 3.24%, and an expected life of 6.7 years.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

We
continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in
circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of net earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments
and is presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.


(O)

Claims
Accruals

Claims
payable represent accruals for the self-insured portion of pending accident
liability, workers’ compensation and physical damage.  These accruals are estimated based on our
evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of
future claims development based on our past claims experience.  Our claims accrual policy for all
self-insurance is to recognize the expense when the event occurs and the costs
of such events are probable and reasonably estimable.  We apply loss development factors to our
accident and workers’ compensation claims history as a part of our process of
recording accruals for losses which are incurred but not reported.  We do not discount our estimated losses.

Our
insurance coverage for the year ended December 31, 2004, specified that the
self-insured limit was the first $2 million for auto accidents and $1 million
for workers’ compensation claims.  During
the year ended December 31, 2003, our self-insured limit on the majority of all
our claims was $1.5 million.  Our
self-insured limits for 2005 are the same as 2004.  We are substantially self-insured for loss of
and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised FASB
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

. 
Interpretation No. 46(R) addresses consolidation by business enterprises
of certain variable interest entities. 
For public entities that are not small business issuers, the provisions
of Interpretation No. 46(R) are effective no later than the end of the first
reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004.  If the variable interest entity is considered
to be a special-purpose entity, Interpretation No. 46(R) shall be applied no
later than the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003.  The adoption of this Interpretation did not
have any material effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets

.  This
Statement amends the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions

. 
APB 29 provided an exception to the basic measurement principle (fair
value) for exchanges of similar assets, requiring that some nonmonetary
exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis. 
SFAS 153 eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange
transactions that do not have commercial substance, that is, transactions that
are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the
reporting entity.  The provisions of SFAS
153 are effective for exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. 
As of December 31, 2004, we believe that SFAS 153 will have no
significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment

.   SFAS No. 123(R) is
a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and supersedes APB 25. 
Among other items, SFAS 123(R) eliminates the use of APB 25 and
intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the
cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity
instruments, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards, in the
financial statements.  In accordance with
SFAS No. 123(R), the cost will be based on the grant-date fair value of the
award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required
to provide service in exchange for the award.  For public entities that do not file as small
business issuers, the provisions of the revised statement


are to be applied
prospectively for awards that are granted, modified, or settled in the first interim
or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. 
When we adopt the standard on July 1, 2005, we will be required to
report in our financial statements the share-based compensation expense for the
last six months of 2005 and may adopt it using the modified-prospective method
effective July 1, 2005.  We are currently
evaluating the impact SFAS No. 123(R) will have on us and based on our
preliminary analysis, expect to report approximately $2.3 million of additional
compensation expense during the period July 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005,
as a result of this new accounting standard.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of
(in thousands):

We
are authorized to borrow up to $150 million under our current revolving line of
credit.  This line of credit is supported
by a credit agreement with a group of banks, which expires November 14,
2005.  No balances were outstanding under
this line of credit at December 31, 2004.

(4)

Capital Stock

In
late May and June 2002, we closed an offering of approximately 11.8 million
shares (adjusted for the stock split in 2003) of common stock.  Approximately 5.6 million shares were issued
and sold by JBHT and 6.2 million shares were sold by a shareholder.  The selling price of the stock was $13 ($26
before the stock split in 2003) per share before underwriter discounts and
other expenses.

We
maintain a Management Incentive Plan (“Plan”) that provides various financial
vehicles to compensate our key employees with JBHT common stock or common stock
equivalents.  Under the Plan, as amended,
we are authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than 17 million shares. At
December 31, 2004, there were approximately 1.0 million shares available for
grant under the Plan.  We have utilized
three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to purchase JBHT common
stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options and nonstatutory stock
options.  As of December 31, 2004, there
are no restricted stock awards or restricted options issued or outstanding.

The
Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees
for the purchase of JBHT common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock at the grant date.  The
options generally vest over a 10-year period and are forfeited if the employee
terminates for any reason.  The Plan


allows the employee to surrender shares of
common stock that the employee already owns in full or partial payment of the
option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy withholding tax
obligations incident to the exercise of an option.

A
summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase JBHT common
stock follows:

During
1995, our Board of Directors established a nonqualified stock option plan to
provide performance- based compensation to the Chairman of the Board (Chairman’s
Plan).  The Chairman’s Plan allowed the
Chairman the option to purchase up to 5.0 million shares (adjusted for the 2003
stock split) of JBHT common stock at a price of $8.81 per share (adjusted for
the stock split).  These options vested
after five years.  The Chairman’s Plan
allowed the Chairman to surrender shares of common stock which he already owned
in full or partial payment of the option price of an option being exercised
and/or to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an
option.  Under the original Chairman’s
Plan, the options were to be exercised within one year of vesting and all
unexercised options would have terminated. 
During 2000, our stockholders amended the Chairman’s Plan whereby the
exercise period was extended two years from date of vesting.  Two million options were exercised during the
year ended December 31, 2002, and 3.0 million options were exercised in 2001.  There were no options outstanding for the
Chairman’s Plan at December 31, 2004.


The
following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at
December 31, 2004:

The weighted average exercise price per share of options
exercisable at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $8.42 and $8.20, respectively.

Income Taxes

Total
income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
allocated as follows (in thousands):

Refundable
income taxes at December 31, 2004, were $19.4 million and income taxes payable
at December 31, 2003, were $1.7 million. 
These amounts have been included in accounts receivable and other
accrued expenses on the balance sheet, respectively.


Income
tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes consists of (in
thousands):

Income
tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes differed from the
amounts computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% for the
following reasons (in thousands):


The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2004 and
2003, are presented below (in thousands):

We
believe our history of profitability and taxable income, the reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, and our utilization of tax planning sufficiently
supports the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, we have not recorded a valuation
allowance as all deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale-
and-leaseback transactions.

In
1999, we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback
of a portion of our Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price
of approximately $175 million.  This
transaction was examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 tax
returns.  In December 2003, we received
an IRS Notice of Proposed Assessment which disallows the tax benefits
associated with these transactions, and as a result, we have filed an appeal in
the matter.  We have had preliminary
discussions with the IRS Appeals Division and have been informed that the IRS
Examination Division has been instructed to prepare additional work since their
case had not been developed adequately for the appellate hearing.  To date, we have not been contacted by the
IRS Examination Division to provide any additional information for their
review.  If a resolution of the matter
cannot be reached in the appeals process, the IRS will forward a 90 day letter,
also known as a Notice of Deficiency. A resolution of the dispute could occur
at any point in the administrative process or could extend through a trial and
court appeals.  If we are unsuccessful in
defending this transaction, we could owe additional taxes and interest.  In 2003, after receiving the IRS Notice of
Proposed Assessment and reviewing applicable accounting literature, we reversed
the 2003 expected non-cash tax benefits of approximately $7.7 million
recognized during 2003, and suspended any further recognition of the
benefit.  Based on events occurring
subsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for a contingent tax
liability of $33.6 million, including accrued interest expense, which
represents all previous tax benefits recognized on these transactions.


The liability for this contingency is
included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as a long-term
liability.  We continue to believe our
tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and
opinions from our external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering
into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS
position using all administrative and legal processes available.  If the IRS were successful in disallowing
100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the total ultimate impact on
liquidity could be approximately $44 million, excluding interest.

(6)

Employee Benefit Plans

We
maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a
401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to participate.  We match a specified percentage of employee
contributions, subject to certain limitations. 
For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, JBHT matching
contributions to the plan were $6.0 million, $6.2 million and $6.8 million,
respectively.

Fair Value of Significant
Financial Instruments

(A)

Cash and
Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and Trade Accounts Payable

The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

(B)

Long-Term
Debt

The
fair value of the fixed-rate debt is presented as the present value of future
cash flows discounted using our current borrowing rate for notes of comparable
maturity.  The calculation arrives at a
theoretical amount we would pay a creditworthy third party to assume our
fixed-rate obligations and not the termination value of these obligations.
Consistent with market practices, such termination values may include various
prepayment and termination fees that we would contractually be required to pay
if we retired the debt early.

The
estimated fair values of our financial instruments are summarized as follows
(in thousands):

Related Party Transactions

During
2001 and in prior years, we paid premiums on life insurance policies on the
lives of our former Senior Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. J.B. Hunt
and his wife.  In 2002, we ceased paying
these premiums.  All premiums paid by JBHT,
along with accrued interest thereon, were reimbursable from a trust which was
the owner and beneficiary of the policy. 
The interest rate applied to these premiums receivable varied from time
to time, but generally reflected JBHT’s cost of borrowed funds.  In December 2004, the entire amount
receivable of $11.2 million, including interest was repaid to JBHT.  Mr. Hunt retired from his position of Senior
Chairman effective December 31, 2004.


In
April 2004, we sold an aircraft hanger, which the Company had owned since
1993.  Net proceeds from this sale
totaled $988,000 and we recognized an approximate $532,000 gain on this
sale.  The hanger was sold to Pinnacle
Air Facilities LLC (Pinnacle).  Mr. J.B. Hunt,
our former Senior Chairman, is a principal and a director of Pinnacle.  The selling price of the hanger was approved
by our Board of Directors and was based on a written appraisal of the property
prepared by an independent third-party appraiser.

(9)

Commitments and
Contingencies

During
1999, we entered into a sale-and-leaseback transaction for a portion of our
container fleet.  Containers having a net
book value of approximately $175 million were sold to third-party leasing
companies at approximate net book value. 
A gain on the transaction has been deferred and will be amortized to
income in relation to rent expense recognized under the leases.  The containers are being leased back under
operating leases over terms of four to 10 years.  Approximately $5.9 million of this intermodal
trailing equipment was repurchased in December 2004.  As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$151 million of obligations remaining under operating lease arrangements
related to trailing equipment.  We also
lease terminal facilities, shuttle yards and computer equipment under operating
leases having various terms.  None of our
operating leases contain any guaranteed residual value clauses.  Under the terms of certain lease agreements,
we are required to maintain certain covenants, including minimum credit
ratings.  We were in compliance with these
requirements at December 31, 2004.

During
2000, we entered into various capital lease agreements to lease tractors.  These tractors were purchased as the
applicable capital leases reached maturity. 
At December 31, 2004, we had no remaining capital lease obligations.

Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or
remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2004, are (in
thousands):

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, gross property and equipment recorded under capital
leases was zero and $110.8 million, respectively.

Total
rent expense was $95.0 million in 2004, $109.2 million in 2003, and $115.1
million in 2002.

At
December 31, 2004, we had committed to property and equipment purchases, net of
expected allowances on revenue equipment sales and trade ins, of approximately
$189 million.


During
2004, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our
performance under certain operating lease commitments and self-insurance
arrangements.  If we default on our
commitments under the lease agreements or other arrangements, we are required
to perform under these guarantees.  The
undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make future payments in the
event of defaults is approximately $18.5 million.  As of December 31, 2004, no amounts had been
accrued for any estimated losses under these obligations, as it is probable
that the suppliers will be able to make all scheduled payments.

The
IRS has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of
transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of intermodal equipment.  See Note 5 for additional information.

We
are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the
normal conduct of business.  Based on the
present knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside
counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of
operations, or our liquidity.

We are currently
engaged in an arbitration process with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF)
railroad to clarify certain financial and operating terms in our Joint Service
Agreement (JSA).  BNSF provides a
significant amount of rail transportation services to our JBI business
segment.  The JSA is an agreement between
BNSF and us, which was signed in 1996, and defines a number of financial and
operating arrangements relative to our intermodal business.  The JSA specifies arbitration as the method
of resolving disagreements if a mediation process does not result in
resolution.  We were unable to resolve
our differences with BNSF through mediation during the second quarter of 2004.

The current
arbitration process commenced on July 7, 2004. 
According to the JSA, any amounts due us or payable to BNSF, determined
through the arbitration process, could be retroactive to July 7, 2004.  Both parties have continued to exchange and
analyze data during late 2004 and early 2005. 
Formal arbitration proceedings are currently scheduled for April and May
of 2005.  At this time, we are unable to
reasonably predict the outcome of this process and, as such, no gain or loss
contingency can be determined or recorded. 
Normal commercial business activity between the parties, including load
tendering, load tracing, billing and payments continues on a timely basis.

Investment in Affiliated
Company

In
March 2000, we, along with five other motor carriers, announced the intent to
contribute all of our non-asset based logistics business into a recently formed
joint venture, Transplace, Inc. (TPI). 
TPI is an Internet-based global transportation logistics company.  TPI commenced operations effective July 1,
2000.  We contributed all of our
logistics segment business and all related intangible assets, plus $5.0 million
of cash, in exchange for an approximate 27% initial membership interest in
TPI.  On December 31, 2002, we acquired
an additional 10% interest in TPI from one of the initial members.  We account for our approximate 37% interest
in TPI utilizing the equity method of accounting.  No gain or loss was recognized upon formation
and contribution of logistics segment assets to TPI.  Equity in earnings of TPI was a loss of $2.5
million in 2004.

We
provided various services to TPI under a shared-service agreement, the terms of
which expired on December 31, 2004.  The
services included primarily computer system operations and maintenance.  The fees from these services approximated
$5.4 million in 2004 and $6.3 million in 2003, and were recorded in the


consolidated statement of earnings as reimbursements of general and
administrative expenses.   An agreement
for similar services was signed in early 2005.

We earned revenues of $67.9 million and $57.6
million from TPI in providing transportation services during 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, trade accounts receivable included $9.1 million and
$7.6 million, respectively, due from TPI for freight and fees related to the
shared-service agreement.

For
the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, we incurred approximately $3.3
million and $14.3 million, respectively, in purchased transportation expense as
a result of TPI providing transportation services.

Segment Information

We
have three reportable business segments, Truck (JBT), Intermodal (JBI), and
Dedicated Contract Services (DCS).  JBT
business includes full truck-load dry-van freight which is typically
transported utilizing company-owned or controlled revenue equipment.  This freight is typically transported over
roads and highways and does not move by rail. 
The JBI segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at
least some portion of the movement and also includes certain repositioning
truck freight moved by JBI equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway
movement is intended to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal
operations.  DCS segment business
typically includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers that
are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS operations usually include formal,
written long-term agreements or contracts which govern services performed and
applicable rates.

Our
customers are geographically dispersed across the United States.  One customer accounted for approximately 15%,
13% and 18% of consolidated operating revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  A summary of certain
segment information is presented below (in millions):

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004.  In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

. 
Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2004, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, has been audited by KPMG LLP, the independent registered
public accounting firm that also audited our consolidated financial
statements.  KPMG LLP’s attestation
