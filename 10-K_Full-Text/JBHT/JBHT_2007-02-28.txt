FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report, including
documents which are incorporated by reference, and other documents which we
file periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), contains statements
that may be considered to be “forward-looking statements.”  Such statements relate to our predictions
concerning future events or operations and are within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, subject to risks,
and should be viewed with caution.  These
statements are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently
available.  Stockholders and prospective
investors are cautioned that actual results and future events may differ
materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of many
factors.  Some of the factors and events
that are not within our control and that could have a material impact on future
operating results include:  general
economic and business conditions, competition and competitive rate
fluctuations, cost and availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and
retain qualified drivers, a loss of one or more major customers, interference
with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads, insurance
costs and availability, claims expense, retention of key employees, terrorist
attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, new or different
environmental or other laws and regulations, increased costs for new revenue
equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of
revenue equipment manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for
guaranteed equipment trade-in values. 
Current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant
fluctuations of quarterly earnings.

You should understand that
many important factors, in addition to those listed above, could impact us
financially.  Our operating results may
fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described in
our filings with the SEC.  Some important
factors that could cause our actual results to differ from estimates or
projections contained in the forward-looking statements are described under “Risk
Factors” in Item 1A.  We assume no
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to the extent we become
aware that it will not be achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest
surface transportation companies in North America.  J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is a
publicly held holding company that, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries
and associated companies, provides a wide range of transportation services to a
diverse group of customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and
Mexico.  Unless otherwise indicated by
the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We were incorporated in Arkansas on August
10, 1961, and have been a publicly held company since our initial public
offering in 1983.  Our service offerings
include transportation of full-load freight, which we directly transport in
multi-modal arrangements utilizing our company-owned revenue equipment and
company drivers, independent contractors, or third parties.  This full-load freight may be transported
entirely by truck over roads and highways, or may be moved, in part, by rail.  We have arrangements with most of the major
North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers and
trailers.  We also provide customized
freight movement, revenue equipment, labor and systems services that are
tailored to meet individual customers’ requirements and typically involve
long-term contracts.  These arrangements
are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple
pickups and drops, local and home deliveries, freight handling, specialized
equipment and network design.  We also
provide integrated capacity and comprehensive transportation services and
solutions by utilizing a network of thousands of reliable third-party
carriers.  While these unrelated outside
carriers at times supplement our dry van, full-load operations, they also
provide flatbed, refrigerated, less-than-truckload and other specialized
equipment, drivers and services.  In
addition, we have a 37% ownership interest in a global transportation logistics
company, Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  TPI is
co-owned by five large transportation companies and provides supplemental
sales, management and freight-movement services through arrangements with a
large number of common carriers.


Our business operations are
primarily organized through three distinct, but complementary, business
segments.  These segments include
intermodal (JBI), dedicated contract services (DCS), and full-load dry-van
(JBT).  Our business is somewhat seasonal
with slightly higher freight volumes typically experienced during the months of
August through early November.  Our DCS
segment is subject to less seasonal variation than our JBI and JBT
segments.  For the calendar year ended
December 31, 2006, our consolidated revenue totaled $3.3 billion, after the
elimination of inter-segment business. 
Of the total, $1.4 billion, or 42%, was generated by our JBI business
segment.  Our JBT segment generated $1.0
billion, or 30%, of total revenue and DCS represented $915 million, or 28%.

Additional general
information about us is available from our Internet website at

www.jbhunt.com

.  We
make a number of reports and other information available free of charge on our
website, including our annual report on Form 10-K, our proxy statement and our
earnings releases.  Our website also
contains corporate governance guidelines, our code of ethics, our whistleblower
policy, committee charters for our Board of Directors and other corporate
policies.

OUR MISSION AND STRATEGY

We forge long-term partnerships with key customers that include
supply-chain management as an integral part of their strategy.  Working in concert, we drive out cost, add
value and function as an extension of our customers’ enterprise.  We believe that our operating strategy can
add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders.

RECENT FOCUS

During the past several years, we have taken significant steps to re-establish
a primary focus on the profitability of our three business segments.  In each segment we have implemented capacity
management decision making processes that result in the deployment of our
assets where we believe they will generate more profit.  We continually focus on replacing
less-profitable freight with higher-margin freight and lanes.  Selective pricing actions and ensuring that
we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major
focus.

In addition, a continuing shortage of qualified drivers and fundamental
changes in shipper supply-chain transportation logistics have resulted in the
conversion of freight from traditional random truckload to intermodal and
dedicated operations.  We continue to
ingrain safety into our corporate culture and conduct all of our operations as
safely as possible.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Segment information is
included in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

JBI Segment

The transportation service offerings of our
JBI segment utilize arrangements with most major North American rail carriers
to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the
continental United States, Canada and Mexico. 
Our JBI segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with
the former Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway Company), a watershed event
in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload
carriers in a joint marketing environment. 
Essentially, JBI draws on the intermodal (also known as “container on
flatcar”) services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its
equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at
the origin and destination rail terminal locations. We may directly provide the
drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our
company-owned tractors, or we may purchase these services from third
parties.  JBI provides seamless coordination
of the rail and over-the-road transport movements for our customers and
delivers a single billing for the complete door-to-door service.


Our intermodal program has grown from 20
loads in late 1989 to nearly 630,000 in 2006. 
JBI operates 27,622 company-controlled containers systemwide.  The entire fleet comprises 53-foot, high-cube
containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal double-stack
economics and superior ride quality.  JBI
also manages a fleet of 1,551 company-owned tractors and 1,946 company drivers
in support of intermodal operations.  We
also began utilizing independent contractors (ICs) in our intermodal segment
during 2005.  We had 23 ICs operating in
our JBI business segment at December 31, 2006. 
At December 31, 2006, the total JBI employee count was 2,189, including
the 1,946 drivers.  Revenue for the JBI
segment in calendar year 2006 was $1.43 billion, compared with $1.28 billion in
2005.  As previously announced, an
arbitration process with the BNSF Railway Company (BNI) was concluded during
the third quarter of 2005.  In accordance
with the settlement terms, we paid BNI $25.8 million in the third quarter of
2005.  In addition, this settlement also
resulted in higher rail purchase transportation expenses effective October 1,
2005.  Normal commercial business activity
continued with BNI during the approximate 15-month arbitration process, and
normal business operations have continued since the final settlement.

DCS Segment

Since 1992, we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service
option.  DCS segment operations
specialize in the design, development and execution of customer-specific fleet
solutions.  Capitalizing on advanced
systems and technologies, DCS offers transportation engineering solutions that
support private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation and transportation
system augmentation.  DCS operations
typically provide customized services that are governed by long-term contracts
and currently include dry-van, flatbed, temperature-controlled, dump trailers
and local inner-city operations.

DCS operations focus on delivering
recognizable customer value through best-in-class service, cost control and
guaranteed dedicated capacity.  DCS
utilizes a proprietary methodology known as Customer Value Delivery® (CVD) to
create, measure and communicate value generated for each customer.  DCS leverages the JBHT freight network to
reposition equipment near outbound domiciles, thereby reducing inefficient
empty miles and system cost.  DCS also
frequently finds synergy in shared resources with the JBT and JBI segments,
including terminals, drivers, maintenance shops, bulk fuel locations and
trailer pools providing further economies of scale.  DCS revenue for calendar year 2006 was $915
million, compared with $844 million in 2005. 
In early 2004, we began utilizing ICs in the DCS segment and at December
31, 2006, we had 122 ICs operating in the DCS segment.  At December 31, 2006, the DCS segment
operated 5,177 company-controlled and 59 customer-owned tractors and employed
6,242 people, 5,496 of whom were drivers.

JBT Segment

Our primary transportation service offerings
classified in this segment include full-load, dry-van freight, which is
predominantly transported utilizing company-controlled tractors operating over
roads and highways.  We pick up our
freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load
directly to the location of the consignee. 
Most of our loads are transported entirely by our company-owned tractors
and employee drivers, or by independent contractors who agree to transport
freight in our trailers.  We also assign
freight to be handled by third-party motor carriers other than ICs.  This type of freight movement typically
results in our billing the customer for all applicable freight charges and, in
turn, paying the third party for their portion of the transportation services
provided.  This type of service usually
results in our recognition of revenue for the entire billing and the payment to
the third-party being classified as purchased transportation expense.

We operate under the approval of certain Canadian authorities, allowing
us to transport freight to and from all points in the continental United States
to Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. 
We have authorization to operate directly in substantially all the
Canadian provinces, but to date we have served limited points in Canada,
primarily through interchange operations with Canadian motor carriers.  In late 2000, we began utilizing ICs in the
JBT segment and at December 31, 2006, we had 962 ICs operating in the JBT
segment, some of whom were leasing company-controlled tractors.  JBT revenue for calendar year 2006 was $1.01
billion, compared with $1.02 billion in 2005. 
At December 31, 2006, the JBT


segment
operated 4,232 company-owned tractors and employed 5,916 people, 4,981 of whom
were drivers.  A portion of our JBT
segment non-driver employees provide freight solicitation, order entry and
other operational support services to our other two segments.  We record inter-segment credits and charges
to properly reflect these inter-segment support services.

Logistics Business and Associated Company

Effective July 1, 2000, we contributed an existing logistics segment
business to a newly formed company, Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  TPI provides supplemental logistics sales and
management support and also has arrangements with approximately 2,700 motor
carriers to provide capacity to transport freight.  Our share of TPI’s financial results is
included on a one-line, non-operating item included on our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated company.”

Operations in Mexico

We have provided transportation services to and from Mexico since
1989.  These services typically involve
equipment interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers.  As previously reported, we sold a joint
venture interest with a Mexican transportation company in 2002.  We received all remaining funds due in
connection with this sale during 2005. 
This transaction did not significantly impact our earnings.  We continue to provide transportation
services to and from Mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of
Mexican carriers.

Marketing and Operations

We transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of
freight, including forest and paper products, building materials, general
merchandise, food and beverages, chemicals and automotive parts.  Our customer base is extremely diverse and
includes a large number of Fortune 500 companies.  Our ability to offer multiple services, utilizing
our three business segments and a full complement of logistics services through
third parties, represents a competitive advantage.  We provide a broad range of transportation
services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers.  Our largest customer in 2006 was Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenue.

We generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide
sales and marketing network.  We do have
some sales and marketing functions managed at the business-unit level,
particularly for our DCS segment.  In
accordance with our typical arrangements, we bill the customer for all services
and we, in turn, pay all third parties for their portion of transportation
services provided.  In recent years, we
have re-established a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of
our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided.

People

We believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors
is our service-oriented people.  As of
December 31, 2006, we had approximately 17,150 employees, including 12,423
company drivers, 1,175 mechanics and 3,548 office personnel.  We also had arrangements with 1,107 ICs to
transport freight in our trailing equipment. 
None of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective
bargaining agreements.

Our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and
retaining enough qualified truck drivers. 
It is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to
exceed 100%.  It has been our practice
during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an above-average level
in order to attract a higher caliber of experience and minimize turnover.  During 2006 and 2005, we increased company
driver and IC compensation in order to attract and retain an adequate supply of
qualified drivers.  While we have not, to
date, experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages,
we expect the costs to recruit, train and retain company drivers and ICs will
continue to rise in the foreseeable future.


Revenue Equipment

As of December 31, 2006, we operated 10,961 company-owned
tractors.  In addition, our 1,107 ICs
operate their own tractors, but transport freight in our trailing
equipment.  We operate with standardized
tractors in as many fleets as possible, particularly in our JBI and JBT
fleets.  Based on our customers’
preferences and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is more
diversified.  We believe operating with
relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts
quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense. 
At December 31, 2006, the average age of our combined tractor fleet was
2.2 years, our trailers averaged 5.7 years of age and our containers averaged
6.5 years.  We perform routine servicing
and preventive maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal
facilities.

Our JBI segment utilizes high-cube containers, which can be separated
from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars.  We are currently in the process of expanding
our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet.  The composition of our DCS trailing fleet
varies with specific customer requirements and may include dry-vans, flatbeds,
temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, straight trucks and dump trailers.  We typically operate newer revenue equipment
in our JBT segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization.

Effective with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated lower
emission standards for newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines.  We are planning our new equipment purchases
to accommodate these new standards but allow adequate testing of the new
engines.  The 2007 EPA-compliant engines
will be equipped with a particulate trap and will require more costly
ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel.  The
EPA estimates that ULSD fuel will cost approximately $.04 to $.05 more per
gallon.  In 2006, we began testing the
2007 model-year engines in a group of our tractors.  We are unable at this time to determine the
increase in acquisition and operating costs of these new 2007 EPA-compliant
engines.

Competition and the Industry

The market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly
fragmented and includes thousands of carriers, many of which are very
small.  While we compete with a number of
smaller carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies
represent competition in all markets across the country.  We compete with other freight transportation
carriers primarily in terms of on-time pickup and delivery service,
availability of drivers, and revenue equipment and price.

Regulation

Our operations as a for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Motor Carrier
Safety Administration, and certain business is also subject to state rules and
regulations.  The DOT periodically
conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety
requirements, and we report certain accident and other information to the
DOT.  Our operations into and out of
Canada and Mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries.

Effective October 1, 2005, driver hours-of-service regulations (HOS)
were revised.  The majority of these rule
changes had initially been effective January 4, 2004.  These collective changes were the most
significant changes to driver HOS in more than 40 years.  In general, the new rules require a driver to
take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a ten-hour
off-duty period.  These new rules
primarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop freight operations and had a
minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results.

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

In addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in
this Form 10-K and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the
following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our
business.  Our business, financial
condition or financial results could be materially


and
adversely affected by any of these risks. 
Also note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us
could also negatively impact our business or financial results.

Our business is subject to
general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control, any
of which could have a material adverse effect

on our results of
operations.

Our business is dependent
upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results
of our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include significant increases
or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry,
interest rates, fuel taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums,
self-insurance levels, interference with or termination of our relationships
with certain railroads, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse
weather conditions, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in
the value of used equipment, surpluses in the market for used equipment, and
difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent
contractors.

We are also affected by
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles,
particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and
manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions represent a greater
potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad-debt
losses.  In addition, our results of
operations may be affected by seasonal factors. 
Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and
our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to
colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time
and higher maintenance costs.

We operate in a competitive and
somewhat fragmented industry.  Numerous
factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to
compete with other carriers and private fleets.

Some of these factors
include:

·

We compete with many other transportation
carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload
carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital
resources than we do.

·

Some of our competitors periodically reduce
their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth
rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase
freight rates or maintain our profit margins.

·

Many customers reduce the number of carriers
they use by selecting so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation
service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.

·

Many customers periodically accept bids from
multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress
freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.

·

Certain of our customers that operate private
fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations.

·

The trend toward consolidation in the
trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial
resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.

·

Advances in technology require increased
investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to
accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments.


We derive a significant portion
of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

For the calendar year ended
December 31, 2006, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for
approximately 40% of our revenue.  Our
largest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately
14% of our total revenue in 2006.  Our
JBT and JBI segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their
customers.  While our DCS segment
business may involve a written contract, those contracts may contain
cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will
continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same
levels.  A reduction in or termination of
our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results.

We depend on third parties in the
operation of our business.

Our JBI business segment
utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services.  These services are provided pursuant to
contractual relationships with the railroads. 
While we have agreements with various Class I railroads, the majority of
our business travels on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk
Southern Railroad.  The inability to
utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.  We
also utilize the services of a number of third-party dray carriers to perform a
significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries.  In addition, a portion of the freight we
deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject
to labor union contracts.

Difficulty in attracting and
retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.

Periodically, the trucking
industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining
qualified drivers, including ICs.  A
shortage of qualified company drivers and ICs has proven to be particularly
severe during the past few years.  In
spite of continued increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs, the
industry is currently experiencing a shortage of drivers.  If we are unable to continue attracting an
adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors, we
could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or
let trucks sit idle, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

Ongoing insurance and claims
expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.

Our future insurance and
claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our
earnings.  During 2005, we self-insured a
portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury,
property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for
auto accidents and $1 million for workers’ compensation.  During 2006, the self-insured portion of our
claims exposure for all claims was reduced to $500,000.  If the number or severity of claims for which
we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely
affected.  The self-insured portion of
our claims will also be $500,000 during 2007. 
We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are
self-insured.  Insurance carriers have
recently raised premiums for most trucking companies.  As a result, our insurance and claims
expenses could increase when our current coverage expires.  If these expenses increase, and we are unable
to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be
materially and adversely affected.

The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain
sale-and-leaseback transactions.

As previously disclosed, the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits
associated with certain sale-and-leaseback transactions, which we entered into
in 1999.  Based on events occurring
subsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for a contingent tax
liability of $33.6 million at December 31, 2004.  The liability for this contingency, which
includes estimated interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2006, as a long-term liability. 
We have accrued approximately $3.0 million of interest expense during
2006 related to this contingency.  We


continue to believe our tax positions comply with
applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our then
external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these
transactions, and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS position
using all administrative and legal processes available.  If the IRS were successful in disallowing
100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the total ultimate impact on
liquidity could be approximately $44 million, excluding interest.

Our operations are subject to
various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result
in substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to various
environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous
materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm
water.  We operate in industrial areas,
where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where
groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage
or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal, among
others.  We also maintain bulk fuel
storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If we are involved in a spill or other
accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation
of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.  If
we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be
subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

We operate in a regulated
industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or
liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

The DOT and various state
agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters
including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment
operation, safety and financial reporting. 
We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance
with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the
DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.

Effective October 1, 2005,
driver HOS regulations were revised.  The
majority of these rule changes had initially been effective January 4,
2004.  These collective changes were the
most significant changes to driver HOS in more than 40 years.  In general, the new rules require a driver to
take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10-hour
off-duty period.  These new rules
primarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop freight operations and had a
minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results.

Effective with model-year
2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated lower emission standards for newly
manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. 
We are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these new
standards but also to allow adequate time for testing of the new engines. In
2006, we began testing the 2007 model-year engines in a group of our
tractors.  We are unable to predict the
impact these new standards will have on our future operations and business
results.

Rapid changes in fuel costs could
impact our periodic financial results.

Fuel and fuel taxes
currently represent our third-largest general expense category.  During the past several years, fuel cost per
gallon has varied significantly, with prices at times changing as much as $0.20
to $0.25 per gallon between consecutive months. 
We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of
our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of
higher fuel costs.  Most of these
programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differences
between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed
to our customers.  In addition, we incur
additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to
our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route
miles that cannot be billed to customers. 
Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material
adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2006, we had no derivative
financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas.  We occupy a number of buildings in Lowell
that we utilize for administrative support, data center, primary customer
service and freight dispatch.  We
maintain a backup data center for disaster recovery, maintenance shop and
driver operations facility in Lowell.  In
December 2005, we took occupancy of a new, approximately 110,000-square-foot
office building that was constructed adjacent to our existing
150,000-square-foot building.  This new
building allowed us to reduce the number of occupied buildings in Lowell and
consolidate most of our corporate support and centralized operations functions.  We also own or lease other significant
facilities where we perform maintenance on our equipment, provide bulk fuel and
employ personnel to support operations. 
Each of our three business segments utilizes our larger facilities for
services including bulk fueling, maintenance and driver support activities.  In addition to our principal properties
listed below, we lease a number of small offices and parking yards throughout
the country that support our customers’ business needs.

Dividend Policy

We paid quarterly dividends during calendar year 1999 and in a number
of years prior to 1999.  In early 2000,
we announced a decision to discontinue dividend payments.  In April 2004, we reinitiated a quarterly
cash dividend of $0.015 per share.  This
reinitiation was based on our lower debt levels and improving cash flows.  We also paid a cash dividend of $0.015 per
share in July and October 2004.  In
December 2004, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.015
to $0.06.  We paid a $0.06 per share
dividend in February, April, July and October 2005.  In January 2006, we announced an increase in
our quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.08.  We paid a $0.08 per share dividend in
February, April, July, and October 2006. 
In January 2007, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend
from $0.08 to $0.09, effective with our payment in February 2007.  We currently intend to continue paying cash
dividends on a quarterly basis.  However,
no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid, since such
payments are dependent on earnings, cash flows and other factors.


Purchases
of Equity Securities

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the purchase of
our common stock.  On December 14, 2004,
our Board authorized the purchase of up to $100 million worth of our common
stock. We commenced purchases of our common stock in January 2005.  On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized the
purchase of an additional $500 million of our common stock over the next five
years.  There were no purchases of
treasury stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2006.  We are authorized to spend an additional $104
million to purchase our common stock through 2010.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The
following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition
should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes
in Item 8.  This discussion contains
forward-looking statements.  Please see “Forward-looking
Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of items, uncertainties,
assumptions and risks associated with these statements.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of
our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the
amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.  Therefore, the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of
contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing
basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and
other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.  Any
effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting
from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in
which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.  We consider our critical accounting policies
and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments
and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the
following:

Workers’ Compensation and
Accident Costs

We purchase
insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries
(workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and cargo claims.  Most of our insurance arrangements include a
level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but
provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs
that are completely insured.  Our
policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to
incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period
inception.  This contractual adjustment
factor is used to convert the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and
relieves us of any further liability on those claims.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased
the estimated accrual of our ultimate losses by $9.2 million to reflect the inclusion
of these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the
accidents occurred rather than in the final year of the self-insurance
period.  See Note 2 of our Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The amounts of
self-insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and
policy expiration dates.  During 2006, we
were self-insured for $500,000 of our claims for personal injury, property
damage and workers’ compensation.  For
the two years ended December 31, 2005, we were self-insured for $2 million of
our claims for personal injury and property damage and $1 million for workers’
compensation claims.   For 2007, we
maintained our $500,000 self-insured coverage limit.

Our claims accrual
policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the
incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and
analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal,
economic and regulatory factors.  Our
safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the
insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each
claim.  The ultimate cost of a claim
develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing and
extent of damages claimed becomes available. 
Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim
information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability.  This process involves the use of
loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes
the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above.  In doing so, the recorded liability considers
future claims growth, conversion to fully insured status and provides an
allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. 
We do not discount our estimated losses. 
At December 31, 2006, we had an accrual of approximately $20 million for
estimated net claims.  In addition, we
are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2006, we had a prepaid
insurance asset of approximately $67 million, which represented pre-funded
claims and premiums.  We are also
substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased
revenue equipment.


Revenue Equipment

We operate a
significant number of tractors, trailers and containers in connection with our
business.  This equipment may be
purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements.  In addition, we may rent revenue equipment
from third parties and various railroads under short-term rental
arrangements.  Revenue equipment which is
purchased is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  We periodically review the useful lives and
salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for
impairment.  We have not identified any
impairments to our existing assets.

We have an
agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade-in values for
certain new equipment.  We have utilized
these trade-in values as well as other operational information, such as
anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense.  If our tractor supplier were unable to
perform under the terms of our agreement for trade-in values, it could have a
material negative impact on our financial results.  We had no revenue equipment under capital
lease arrangements at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize
revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported.  Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue
which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in
each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and
delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.

Our trade accounts
receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for
uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and
reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as
any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account
collectibility.  The adequacy of our
allowances and reserves is reviewed quarterly.

Income Taxes

We account for
income taxes under the asset-and-liability method in accordance with current
accounting standards.  Our deferred tax
assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a
tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related
tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings.  Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of
timing differences  between when items
are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements compared to when they
are recognized in our tax returns.  We
assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income.  To the extent we believe
recovery is not probable, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent
we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our income
tax provision.  We have not recorded a
valuation allowance at December 31, 2006, as all deferred tax assets are more
likely than not to be realized.

Significant
judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax
laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes.  We establish accruals when, despite our
belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, it is probable that
we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of
loss can be reasonably estimated.  We
adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for
income taxes based upon changing facts and circumstances.  A number of years may elapse before a
particular matter, for which we have established an accrual, is audited and
resolved.  See Note 6, Income Taxes, in
our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a discussion of our current tax
contingencies.


YEAR IN
REVIEW

Our financial
results for calendar year 2006 represented the fifth consecutive year of record
revenues and earnings.  Our 2006 net earnings
of $220.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, were up 6% over the $207.3
million, or $1.28 per diluted share, earned in 2005.  Fuel costs continued to represent a challenge
for the transportation industry during 2006. 
Our 2006 fuel cost per gallon averaged 13% above 2005 levels.  However, due to our fuel surcharge programs
and the support and understanding of our customers, we were able to recover the
majority of our higher fuel costs.

Freight demand
during 2006 was relatively consistent for our intermodal and dedicated
segments.  Demand for dry-van truck
capacity was softer, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2006.  Comparisons of 2006 dry-van volumes to 2005
were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments in 2005 and
lower-than-expected seasonal demand during August through November of
2006.  Our intermodal and dedicated
business units contributed to our higher level of profitability in 2006, while
our truck segment experienced an approximate 27% decline in operating income as
compared to 2005.  Partly in response to
changing market conditions, we increased the size of our intermodal and
dedicated tractor fleets by 16% and 7%, respectively, and decreased our dry-van
fleet by 6%.  We were able to effect some
of these changes by merely transferring tractors among our fleets.

We also continued
our focus on capacity management during 2006. 
Capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight
demand on a daily basis and our contractual relationships to determine which
business application and segment generates the best returns. We also
continually analyze our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all
services that we provide.  In addition to
our capacity management actions, the continuing shortage of quality drivers and
changes in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from
over-the-road truck operations to intermodal and dedicated.

Our 2006
consolidated operating ratio (operating expenses divided by total operating
revenues) was 88.8%, compared with 89.0% in 2005.  The current year was the third consecutive
time that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90%.  Our 2006 operating income reflected a $12.4
million pretax charge to increase insurance reserves, and 2005 results included
a $25.8 million pretax arbitration charge. 
We reinitiated paying a quarterly cash dividend in early 2004 and have
increased our dividend to $0.06 in late 2004, $0.08 in late 2005 and to $0.09
in January 2007.  We have continued to
purchase shares of our outstanding stock through 2006.  During the current year we purchased $257
million of our common stock and at December 31, 2006, we had $104 million
authorized for future purchases.

2006 Compared With 2005

Consolidated Operating Revenues

Our total
consolidated operating revenues rose to $3.33 billion in 2006, a 6.4% increase
over 2005.  Significantly higher fuel
prices resulted in FSC revenues of $430 million in 2006, compared with $336
million in 2005.  This FSC revenue
impacted our year-to-year comparison.  If
FSC revenues were excluded from both years, the increase of 2006 revenue over
2005 was 3.8%.  This increased level of
revenue, excluding FSC, was primarily a result of increases in load volume and
price improvements as a result of our capacity-management actions.  A 5.1% and 2.2% increase in 2006 JBI and DCS
load volume, respectively, contributed to our higher levels of revenue.  The increases in revenue of our JBI and DCS
segments were partially offset by decreases in our JBT segment as a result of a
smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization.

Consolidated Operating Expenses

Our total 2006
consolidated operating expenses increased 6.1% over 2005.  The combination of the 6.4% increase in 2006
revenue over 2005 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2006
operating ratio improving slightly to 88.8% from 89.0% in 2005.  Rents and purchased transportation costs rose
6.3% in 2006, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage
companies related to JBI growth.  The
total cost of salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 4.3% in 2006 over
2005, primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation.


Fuel and fuel
taxes expense was up 15.0% in 2006, primarily due to 12.6% higher fuel cost per
gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  We have fuel surcharge programs in place with
the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue
charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change.  It is not meaningful to compare the amount of
FSC revenue or the change of FSC revenue between reporting periods to fuel and
fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a
significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads,
dray carriers and other third parties. 
These payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.  While we are not always able to recover all
fuel cost increases, partly due to empty miles run and engine-idling time, we
were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs.

The 12.6% increase
in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment
purchases, higher new-tractor purchase prices, and an approximate 5% increase
in the size of our company-owned tractor fleet. 
Operating supplies and expenses rose 9.7% in 2006, partly a result of
higher tractor maintenance, tires and tolls costs.  A number of states have recently raised their
rates for highway and bridge tolls.  The
27.7% decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver
recruiting and testing costs, legal and professional fees related to our
arbitration proceeding, and charitable contributions in 2005 that declined or
did not reoccur in 2006.  Also included
in the general and administrative expense category, we recognized a $2.9
million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2006, compared with a $1.8
million gain in 2005.  The arbitration
settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the BNI arbitration decision
discussed in the section on Operating Segments.

We accrued
approximately $3.0 million of interest expense during 2006 related to an IRS
contingency.  Our effective income tax
rate was 37.9% in 2006 and 2005.  We
expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 38.5% for calendar year
2007, but it may be impacted by the adoption of FIN 48.  We are currently assessing the impact of this
pronouncement on our effective tax rate. 
See the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section for a discussion of FIN
48.  The “equity in loss of associated
company” item on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of
the operating results of TPI.

JBI Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 11.4% to $1.43 billion in 2006, from $1.28
billion in 2005.  A significant portion
of this revenue growth was driven by a 5.1% increase in load volume.   In addition, freight rates increased nearly
4% over 2005.  The remaining portion of
revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel
surcharge revenue.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose to $182 million in 2006, from
$124 million in 2005.  The $25.8 million
arbitration settlement charge incurred in September 2005 favorably impacted
this comparison.  While this settlement
also increased rail purchased transportation expense subsequent to October 1,
2005, higher freight rates, increased volumes and reduced use of rail control
equipment increased 2006 operating income.

DCS Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 8.4% to $915 million in 2006, from $844
million in 2005.  This increase in
revenue was primarily due to a 2.2% increase in load volume, an approximate 4%
increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue.

Operating income increased to $104 million in 2006, compared with $100
million in 2005.  Similar to 2005, we
conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities
to either improve margins or redeploy assets. 
Financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure
helped ensure that new business during 2006 generated appropriate financial
returns.  We also remained focused on
cost controls and raised rates when appropriate.

JBT Segment

JBT segment revenue declined 1.2% to $1.01 billion in 2006, from $1.02
billion in 2005.  This decline was
primarily due to a 1.1% reduction in load volume.  While rates from consistent shippers
increased approximately 2% during 2006, a decline in rates from spot and
back-up pricing and paid empty movements partly offset these increases.

Operating income in our JBT segment declined to $87 million in 2006,
from $119 million in 2005.  The decrease
was due, in part, to lower levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver
compensation and insurance costs.


Compared With 2004

Overview of 2005

Our 2005 net earnings of $207.3 million, or $1.28
per diluted share, were up 42% over the $146.3 million, or $0.88 per diluted
share, earned in 2004.  Our total
consolidated operating revenues rose to $3.13 billion in 2005, a 12.3% increase
over 2004.  Freight demand during the
first half of 2005 was not as strong as the comparable period of 2004, but
volume levels improved during the last half of 2005. Our DCS and JBT segments
contributed most significantly to our higher level of profitability in 2005.
While increases in the size of the DCS and JBT tractor fleets accounted for a
portion of the increases in operating income, our continued focus on capacity
management and revenue per tractor was the primary factor driving 2005 improved
net earnings.   Our 2005 net earnings
were negatively impacted by the arbitration settlement as previously discussed.

JBI Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 15.2% to $1.28 billion in 2005, from $1.12
billion in 2004.  If FSC revenue were
excluded from both years, 2005 segment revenue increased 8.6% over 2004.  A significant portion of this revenue growth
was driven by a 5.0% increase in revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC.  In addition, 2005 load volume increased 2.9%
over 2004.  The remaining portion of
revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix.

Operating income in our JBI segment declined to $124 million in 2005,
from $131 million in 2004.  As previously
discussed, the $25.8 million arbitration settlement paid to BNI during the
third quarter of 2005 reduced JBI operating income.  In addition, this settlement also resulted in
higher rail purchased transportation expense effective October 1, 2005.  These costs more than offset the impact of
higher rates and volume in the segment.

DCS Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 11.1% to $844 million in 2005, from $760
million in 2004.  The increase in fuel
surcharge revenue in 2005 significantly impacted this comparison.  If we exclude fuel surcharge revenue from
both years, DCS segment revenue rose 6.3% over 2004.  This increase in revenue resulted from a combination
of a 2.5% increase in the average tractor count and a 5.3% increase in net
revenue per tractor, excluding FSC. 
These increases were partly offset by a 1.4% decline in revenue related
to freight delivered by third-party carriers. 
The majority of these movements were billed by us to the customer in
2004.  In 2005, a larger portion of these
movements was billed directly to our customer by the third-party carrier.

Operating income rose 34% to $100 million in 2005, compared with $75
million in 2004.  Similar to 2004, we
conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts, identifying
opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets.  Financial discipline in the area of pricing
and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2005 generated
appropriate financial returns.  We also
remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate.

JBT Segment

JBT segment revenue was $1.02 billion in 2005, up 9.9% over the $928
million in 2004.  Higher FSC revenue in
2005 impacted this comparison.  If the
amount of FSC revenue were excluded from both years, 2005 JBT revenue rose 4.7%
over 2004.  The average tractor count in
2005 was essentially the same as 2004. 
However, revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, was 6.0% above
2004.  This higher level of revenue per
loaded mile was offset by approximately 1.5% lower tractor utilization.  Current-year revenue growth was also up due
to additional outsourced freight activity.

Operating income of our JBT segment climbed to $119 million in 2005,
from $103 million in 2004.  The
significant increase in revenue per loaded mile, excluding FSC, accounted for
the majority of this operating income improvement.


Consolidated Operating Expenses

Our total 2005 consolidated operating expenses increased 12.4% over
2004.  The combination of the 12.3%
increase in 2005 revenue over 2004 and this increase in operating expenses
resulted in our 2005 operating ratio increasing slightly to 89.0% from 88.9% in
2004.  Rents and purchased transportation
costs rose 13.5% in 2005, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads
and drayage companies, related to JBI growth. 
The total cost of salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 3.0%
in 2005 over 2004, primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation.

Fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 34.8% in 2005, primarily due to 33%
higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  It is difficult to compare the amount of FSC
revenue or the change of FSC revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel
taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant
portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers
and other third parties.  These payments
are classified as purchased transportation expense.  The 8.9% increase in depreciation and
amortization expense was partly a result of higher new-tractor purchase prices
and an approximate 3% increase in the size of our company-owned tractor fleet.

Operating supplies and expenses rose 7.0% in 2005, partly a result of
higher trailing equipment maintenance, tires and tolls costs.  A number of states have recently raised their
rates for highway and bridge tolls.  The
significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects higher
driver recruiting and testing costs, legal and professional fees related to our
arbitration proceeding, and charitable contributions.  In October 2005, we announced a $10 million
gift to the University of Arkansas recorded at its net present value of
approximately $5.6 million.  Also
included in the general and administrative expense category, we recognized a
$1.8 million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2005, compared with a
$0.4 million gain in 2004.  The
arbitration settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the arbitration
decision discussed earlier.  We accrued
approximately $2.7 million of interest expense during 2005 related to an IRS
contingency.  Our effective income tax
rate was 37.9% in 2005 and 51.6% in 2004. 
Income tax expense in 2004 included a contingent tax liability of $33.6
million, including accrued interest, related to the IRS’s challenge of certain
sale-and-leaseback transactions that closed in 1999.

The “equity in loss of associated company” item on our Consolidated
Statement of Earnings reflects our share of the operating results of TPI.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $423 million in 2006,
$332 million in 2005 and $405 million in 2004. 
Our continued improvement in net earnings has enhanced net cash from
operations.  The increase in 2006 cash
provided by operating activities relative to 2005, after consideration of
adjustments for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, was due
to higher earnings, collection of insurance reimbursements and a decrease in
our insurance prepaid balance, which is a result of lower insurance
premiums.  The increase was partially
offset by larger federal income tax refunds due us at December 31, 2006,
compared to income taxes payable at December 31, 2005.

Cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to
and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment.  The higher level of cash used in investing
activities during 2006 was primarily a result of significant increases of
trailing equipment purchases to replace older trailing equipment.  At December 31, 2006, we had no revenue
equipment on capital leases.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2006 reflects the purchase
of $257 million of our common stock and payment of dividends of nearly $48
million in 2006.  Our net cash used in
financing activities decreased over 2005 due to an increase in borrowings on
long-term debt and our credit revolvers. 
Funds were used primarily for stock purchases and the payment of
dividends.

From time to time, our Board of Directors authorizes the purchase of
our common stock.  As previously
mentioned, the Board, in December 2004, authorized the purchase of up to $100
million of our common stock.  We made no
purchases in 2004 and commenced purchases of our common stock in January
2005.  On April 21, 2005, our Board
authorized the purchase of an additional $500 million of our common stock over
the next five years.  We purchased $257
million of our common stock in 2006 and $239 million in 2005.  As of December 31, 2006, we were authorized
to spend an additional $104 million to purchase our common stock through 2010.

Liquidity

Our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of
intermodal trailing equipment, trucks, tractors and dry-van trailers required
to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new, late-model
equipment.  We are frequently able to
accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions.  We have, during the past few years, obtained
capital through cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit
and most recently issued a term loan to acquire trailers that were previously
leased.  We have also periodically
utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment.  We had no capital lease arrangements at
December 31, 2006. To date, none of our operating leases contains any
guaranteed residual value clauses.

At December 31, 2006, we were authorized to borrow up to a total of
$400 million under two different revolving lines of credit.  The first line of credit is supported by a
credit agreement with a group of banks for a total amount of $200 million.  This line of credit is unsecured and matures
in April 2010. The applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on
either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing,
plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating.  At December 31, 2006, we had $99.9 million
outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.92% under this agreement.

Our second line of credit is an Accounts Receivable
Securitization program through ABN AMRO, N.V. with a revolving credit facility
up to $200 million.  This facility is
secured by our accounts receivable and matures on July 30, 2007.  The applicable interest rate under this
agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper rate in the market plus a
margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees.  At December 31, 2006, we had $200 million
outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.58% under this agreement.  We plan to renew this line of credit upon
expiration with a one-year term.

During 2006, we utilized a $200 million bridge loan
with LaSalle Bank National Association.  This
loan was a temporary facility until our Accounts Receivable Securitization was
finalized.  An $82.9 million balance was
paid off with the proceeds from the Accounts Receivable Securitization during
the third quarter.  This loan has been
cancelled and we had no outstanding balance related to this facility at
December 31, 2006.

On September 29, 2006, we purchased approximately
$101.5 million of used, dry-van trailers off operating lease agreements.  In connection with the purchase of these
trailers, we entered into a term loan and credit agreement (the “facility”)
arranged by Sun Trust Bank.  This new
$100 million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing
equipment.  This facility matures on
September 29, 2009 and our borrowing costs are based on three-month LIBOR plus
an applicable margin.  On September 29,
2006, we entered into an interest rate swap that effectively converts the variable
rate to a fixed rate of


5.85%.  We are required to make
periodic minimum principal payments.  A
$3.5 million principal payment was due and paid on December 29, 2006, with
additional $3.5 million principal payments due every three months thereafter
through June 29, 2009.  This facility
requires us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with these covenants
and financial ratios at December 31, 2006.

We
believe that our liquid assets, cash generated from operations and revolving
lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital
requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our
increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock.

As
mentioned above, we had significant expenditures related to new trailing equipment
for 2006.  We are currently committed to
spend approximately $129.4 million during 2007 for trailers and other revenue
equipment.  The actual cash expended will
be net of proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances on revenue equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our
only off-balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for
trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and
facilities.  As of December 31, 2006, we
had approximately 10,700 trailers and 1,000 containers/chassis that were
subject to operating leases, and we had approximately $40 million of
obligations remaining under these leases.

compensation claims, and (2) our operating lease agreements.  We plan to renew these letters of credit in
accordance with our third-party agreements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Share-based Payments

We
may issue stock options and other stock-based awards to our key employees and
directors under our Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).  We currently are granting restricted share
units and nonstatutory stock options. 
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock-based employee
compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of APB 25,
as permitted by SFAS 123.  We did not
record any stock-based employee compensation expense for options granted under
our stock option plan prior to January 1, 2006. 
We recognize the cost of the restricted share units over the applicable
vesting period and as a result recorded approximately $0.5 million of
compensation expense in


connection with our
restricted share unit issuances in 2005. 
In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, prior to January 1, 2006, we
disclosed our pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share as if we
had applied the fair value-based method in measuring compensation expense for
our stock-based incentive programs.

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective
transition method.  Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes:
(i) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted prior to,
but not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123; and
(ii) compensation expense for all stock-based payments granted on or after
January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R.  Because we elected to use the modified
prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been
restated.  The adoption of SFAS 123R is
discussed in Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In
June 2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN
48). This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and
provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. This Interpretation is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.  While we continue to analyze and quantify the
impact of this Interpretation, we estimate a cumulative effect adjustment to
reduce retained earnings of between $2 million and $9 million.

Fair Value Measurements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157). SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007.  We
are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 157 on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In

February

2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(SFAS 159).  SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings.  SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. 
We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Of our total $396.4 million of long-term debt, we had $299.9 million of
variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, under our revolving lines
of credit.  The interest rates applicable
to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or LIBOR.  Our earnings would be affected by changes in
these short-term interest rates.  Risk
can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse
increase in short-term interest rates. 
At our current level of borrowing, a 1% increase in our applicable rate
would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately $3.0 million.  Our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate
debt as a result of our interest rate swap and therefore changes in market
interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense.

Although we conduct business in foreign countries, international
operations are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.  Additionally,
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results
of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Accordingly, we are not currently subject to
material foreign currency exchange rate risks from


the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would
have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our
foreign investment.  To date, we have not
entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other
derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

The price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations
due to changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather and
other market factors.  Historically, we
have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers
in the form of fuel surcharges.  We
cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the
future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such
increases.  As of December 31, 2006, we
had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006.  In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

.  Based on our assessment, we believe that as
of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm that also audited our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s
attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

There has been no
change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
quarter ended December 31, 2006, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2006.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of J.B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in
the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed
its method of accounting for share-based compensation.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related information appearing in this
report.  We take these responsibilities
very seriously and are committed to maintaining controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that we collect the information we are required to
disclose in our reports to the SEC and to process, summarize and disclose this
information within the time periods specified by the SEC.

Based on
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, and conducted by our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
believe that our controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are
able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed with the SEC within the required time periods.

We are
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. 
We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006.  In
making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

.  Based on our assessment, we believe that as
of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.

Management’s

assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm that also audited our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s
attestation report on management’s assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries

We
have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).  J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and
subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
management’s assessment that J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSO criteria.  Also, in our opinion,
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and
our report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

1.     Business

J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. is one of the largest full-load and multi-modal
transportation service companies in North America.  We operate three distinct, but complementary,
business segments and provide a wide range of general and specifically tailored
freight and logistics services to our customers.  We generate revenues primarily from the
actual movement of freight from shippers to consignees and from serving as a
logistics provider by offering or arranging for others to provide the
transportation service.  Unless otherwise
indicated by the context, "we," "us," "our" and
"JBHT" refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

A.    Basis of Consolidation

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all of
our wholly owned subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

B.    Use of Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
this report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these statements requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the amounts reported
in such statements and accompanying notes. 
We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical
experience, consulting with experts and using other methods we consider
reasonable in the particular circumstances. 
Nevertheless, our actual results may differ significantly from our
estimates.

We believe that certain accounting policies and
estimates are of more significance in our financial statement preparation
process than others.  We believe the most
critical accounting policies and estimates include the economic useful lives
and salvage values of our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts
receivable, and estimates of exposures under our insurance and claims
plans.  To the extent that actual, final
outcomes are different than our estimates, or additional facts and
circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that
accounting period will be affected.

C.    Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is
invested in short-term, highly liquid investments.  We consider all highly liquid investments
purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

D.    Accounts Receivable Allowance

Our trade accounts receivable includes accounts
receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue
adjustments.  The allowance for
uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical
experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer
billing and account collectibility.  The
adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and
revenue adjustments was $6.0 million and $7.4 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.


E.

Inventory

Our inventories consist
primarily of revenue equipment parts, tires, supplies and fuel and are valued
using the lower of average cost or market.

F.     Property
and Equipment

Depreciation of property and
equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of 4 to 10 years for tractors and 7 to 20 years for trailing equipment,
10 to 40 years for structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture
and office equipment.  Salvage values are
typically 10% to 20% for tractors and trailing equipment and consider any
agreements with tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain
new equipment.  We capitalize tires
placed in service on new revenue equipment as a part of the equipment cost.  Replacement tires and costs for recapping tires
are expensed at the time the tires are placed in service.  Gains and losses on the sale or other
disposition of equipment are recognized at the time of the disposition and are
classified in general and administrative expenses.

G.    Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based
on relative transit time in each reporting period, with expenses recognized as
incurred.

H.    Derivative Instruments

We account for derivatives
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(SFAS 133), as amended.  We periodically
utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest
rates.  At inception of a derivative
contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged
items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined that a derivative is not
highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective
hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.  We entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed interest
rate.  This derivative instrument is
accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with SFAS 133.

I.      Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset-and-liability method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

(SFAS 109), as amended. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or
expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

J.     Earnings Per Share

We compute basic earnings
per share by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the
actual weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting
period.  Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if holders of options or
unvested restricted share units exercised or converted their holdings into common
stock. Outstanding stock options and unvested restricted share units represent
the dilutive effects on weighted average


shares. A reconciliation of
the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is
shown below (in thousands):

price of the common shares, are shown in the table below.

On April 21, 2005, we announced a
two-for-one stock split on our common stock, payable May 23, 2005, to
stockholders of record on May 2, 2005. 
All references in our financial statements with regard to number of shares
and the per-share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this
stock split.

K.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk, include trade receivables. 
For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our top 10
customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 40%, 40% and 42%,
respectively, of our total revenue.  Our
top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 35% of our
total trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005.  One customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
accounted for 14%, 15% and 15% of our total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Each of our three business segments conducts business with Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc.

L.

Share-Based
Compensation

We
have share-based compensation plans covering certain employees including
officers and directors.  Effective
January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation utilizing the fair
value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123R,

Share-based Payment

(SFAS 123R).  We currently are utilizing restricted share
units and nonstatutory stock options. 
Issuances of our stock upon share option exercise or vested restricted
share units are made from treasury stock. 
Our restricted share unit awards are graded-vesting awards and therefore
vest in increments during the requisite service period.  We recognize compensation expenses over the
requisite service period for the entire award.

M.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

We
continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in
circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.


N.

Claims
Accruals

Claims accruals represent the self-insured portion of pending accident
liability, workers’ compensation and physical damage claims.  These accruals are estimated based on our
evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of
future claims development based on our past claims experience.  Our claims-accrual policy for all self-insurance
is to recognize the expense when the event occurs and the costs of such events
are probable and reasonably estimable. 
We apply loss-development factors to our accident and workers’
compensation claims history as a part of our process of recording accruals for
future claims growth and losses that are incurred but not reported.  We do not discount our estimated losses.

Effective January 1, 2006, our self-insured limits were the first
$500,000 for personal injury, property damage and workers’ compensation
claims.  Prior to January 1, 2006, our
insurance coverage for the two years ended December 31, 2005, specified that
the self-insured limit was the first $2 million for personal injury and
property damage and $1 million for workers’ compensation claims.  For 2007 we maintained our $500,000
self-insured limit.  We are substantially
self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.

Our policies include a contractual adjustment factor to be applied to
incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period
inception.  This contractual factor is
used to convert the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us
of any further liability on those claims. 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, we increased the estimated accrual of our
ultimate losses by $9.2 million to reflect the inclusion of these contractual
factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occurred
rather than in the final year of the self-insurance period.

O.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48)

.

This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and
provides guidance on classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. This Interpretation is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.

While we continue to analyze and quantify the impact
of this Interpretation, we estimate a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce
retained earnings of between $2 million and $9 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(SFAS 157).  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair
value measurements.  SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.  We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS
157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(SFAS 159).  SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to
measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings.  SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. 
We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

2008 - $14.0; 2009 - $68.5; 2010 - $99.9; and 2011 - $0.0.

Revolving
Lines of Credit

At December 31, 2006, we
were authorized to borrow up to a total of $400 million under two different
revolving lines of credit. The first line of credit is supported by a credit
agreement with a group of banks for a total amount of $200 million. This line
of credit is unsecured and matures in April 2010. The applicable interest rate
under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon
the specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings
and our credit rating. At December 31, 2006, we had $99.9 million outstanding
at an average interest rate of 5.92% under this agreement.

Our second line of credit is
an Accounts Receivable Securitization program with ABN AMRO, N.V. with a
revolving credit facility up to $200 million. 
Under the terms of the agreement, we sell substantially all of our
eligible third-party receivables to JBH Receivables, LLC (JBR), a wholly owned,
bankruptcy remote entity and retain servicing responsibilities.  The assets of JBR are not available to
satisfy the creditors of any other entity, including our subsidiaries.  This facility matures on July 30, 2007.  The applicable interest rate under this
agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper rate in the market. At December
31, 2006, we had $200 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.58%
under this agreement.

Term Loan

In connection with the
purchase of used, dry-van trailers, we entered into a term loan and credit
agreement (the “facility”) arranged by Sun Trust Bank in 2006.  This $100 million facility is collateralized
by a security interest in the trailing equipment. This facility matures on
September 29, 2009, and our borrowing costs are based on three-month LIBOR plus
an applicable margin.  We are required to
make periodic minimum principal payments. 
The first principal payment of $3.5 million was due and paid on December
29, 2006.  Additional $3.5 million
principal payments are due every three months thereafter through June 29, 2009.

Our revolving lines of
credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and
financial ratios.  We were in compliance
with all covenants and financial ratios at December 31, 2006.

4.

Capital Stock

We have one class of preferred stock and one class
of common stock.  We had no outstanding
shares of preferred stock at December 31, 2006 or 2005.  Holders of shares of common stock are
entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors
and are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of
the shareholders.  At December 31,
2006, we had 13.2 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to share-based payment plans, of which 10.1 million shares have not been
granted.

In December 2004, our Board of Directors authorized
the purchase of up to $100 million of our common stock.  We made no purchases in 2004 and commenced
purchases of our common stock in


January 2005.  On April 21, 2005,
our Board authorized the purchase of an additional $500 million of our common
stock over the next five years.  We
purchased 11.1 million shares of our common stock for $257 million in 2006 and
11.7 million shares for $239 million in 2005. 
We are authorized to spend an additional $104 million to purchase our
common stock through 2010.

On January 31, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly
dividend of $0.09 per common share, payable on February 21, 2007, to
stockholders of record on February 7, 2006.

Share-based Compensation

We maintain a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that provides
various share-based financial vehicles to compensate our key employees with
shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents. Under the Plan, as
amended, we have, from time to time, utilized restricted share unit awards,
restricted options and nonstatutory stock options to compensate our employees
and directors. We currently are utilizing restricted share units and
nonstatutory stock options.

Our nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the
purchase of our common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
at the grant date as awarded by the Compensation Committee. These options
generally vest over a 10-year period and are forfeited if the employee
terminates for any reason other than death, disability or retirement after age
55. An employee is allowed to surrender shares of common stock that the
employee has owned for at least six months in full or partial payment of the
option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy tax withholding
obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  We did not grant any stock options during the
year ended December 31, 2006.  We granted
113,000 and 1,553,000 stock options in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

We began awarding restricted share units in 2005 and awarded 676,720
and 633,200 units during 2006 and 2005, respectively.  These restricted share units have various
vesting schedules ranging from five to ten years. These restricted share units
do not contain rights to vote or receive dividends until the vesting date.  Unvested restricted share units are forfeited
if the employee terminates for any reason other than death, disability or
special circumstances as determined by the Compensation Committee.

Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our share-based compensation
using the intrinsic value method and in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

(APB 25) and related interpretations.  In accordance with this previous guidance,
compensation expense related to stock option grants was recorded on the date of
the grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price.  Under APB 25, we
recognized the cost of restricted share units over the applicable vesting
period.  As a result, we recognized
approximately $0.5 million of expense during 2005 related to our restricted
share units.  However, prior to January
1, 2006, we did not record compensation expense related to unexercised stock
options and provided pro forma disclosure amounts in our footnotes in
accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

(SFAS 123).

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

(revised 2004) (SFAS
123R) required the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in our Consolidated
Financial Statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards.  In accordance with SFAS 123R, this cost will
be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award.  For
awards outstanding as of January 1, 2006, SFAS 123R required us to recognize
compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding share-based
payments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.  It also required that the benefits associated
with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be reported as
a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow.  We adopted SFAS 123R, effective January 1,
2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and, therefore, did not restate
our prior-period results.


The following table includes
the disclosures required by SFAS 123, and illustrates the pro forma impact on
net earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value
recognition provision of SFAS 123:

Our financial results for

Income taxes refundable at December 31, 2006, were $11.8 million and
income taxes payable at December 31, 2005, were $1.9 million.  These amounts have been included in income
tax receivable and other accrued expenses on the balance sheet, respectively.

We believe our history of profitability and taxable income, the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and our utilization of tax planning
sufficiently supports the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, we have not recorded a valuation
allowance as all deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to
disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale-and-leaseback
transactions.  In 1999, we entered into a
series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our
Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately
$175 million.  This transaction was
examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 tax returns.  In December 2003, we received an IRS Notice
of Proposed Assessment that disallowed the tax benefits associated with these
transactions, and as a result, we have filed an appeal in the matter. Based on
events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2004, we have reversed all prior
benefits taken on this transaction. We have recorded a contingent liability of
approximately $42.9 million (including accrued interest of $15.9 million) at
December 31, 2006, and $36.3 million (including accrued interest of $9.3
million) at December 31, 2005, as a component of other long-term liabilities on
our balance sheet. We have held conferences with the IRS Appeals Division;
however, no resolution of the matter has been reached. If a resolution cannot
ultimately be reached in the appeals process, the IRS will forward a 90-day
letter, also known as a Notice of Deficiency. 
A resolution of the dispute could occur at any point in the


administrative process or could extend through a trial
and court appeals.  If we are
unsuccessful in defending this transaction, we could owe additional taxes and
interest, which we believe have been properly accrued on our balance sheet at
December 31, 2006.  We continue to
believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we
received advice and opinions from our then external public accountants and
attorneys prior to entering into these transactions, and we continue to
vigorously defend against the IRS position using all administrative and legal
processes available.

7.

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which
includes a 401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to
participate.  We match a specified
percentage of employee contributions, subject to certain limitations.  For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, our matching contributions to the plan were $7.5 million, $7.6
million and $6.0 million, respectively.

We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible
employees to defer a portion of their compensation.  Participants can elect to defer up to a
maximum of 50% of their base salary as well as up to 85% of their bonus for the
year.  The compensation deferred under
this plan is credited with earnings or losses of investments elected by plan
participants.  Each participant is fully
vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however, these amounts are
subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed to the
employee.  A participant may elect to
receive deferred amounts in one payment or, if the balance is greater than
$25,000, in quarterly installments payable over a period of 3, 5, 10 or 15
years upon reaching age 55, having 15 years of service, or becoming
disabled.  Our total liability under this
plan was $8.6 million as of December 31, 2006, and $6.7 million as of December
31, 2005.  These amounts are included in
other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Participant withholdings are held by a
trustee and invested in equity securities as directed by participants.  These investments are included in other assets
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $8.6 million as of December 31,
2006 and $6.7 million as of December 31, 2005.

8.

Derivative and Financial
Instruments

Interest rate swap

On September 29, 2006, we entered into an agreement
to swap the variable rate on our $100 million term loan and credit facility for
a fixed 5.85% interest rate. This interest rate swap effectively converts the
floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest
rate changes on future interest expense. The swap expires September 29, 2009,
when the related term loan is due. The derivative is designated as a hedge of
the variability of cash flows to be paid related to the term loan and meets the
required criteria of a cash flow hedge under the provisions of SFAS 133.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as the
underlying hedged item affects earnings to the extent the derivative is
effective in offsetting gains and losses of changes in the fair value of the
hedged item. The ineffective portion of gains and losses, if any, is recorded
in current earnings through interest expense. 
The fair value of the swap is recorded in other non-current liabilities
at December 31, 2006.

Fair value

The carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of our long-term debt and interest rate swap contract at
December 31, 2006, were as follows (in thousands):

Related-Party Transactions

In October 2005, we
announced a $10 million gift to the University of Arkansas to facilitate the
construction of a new J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Center for Academic
Excellence building.  Dr. John A. White
has been a member of our Board of Directors since 1998 and serves as the
Chairman of our Audit Committee.  Dr.
White is the Chancellor of the University of Arkansas.  Johnelle D. Hunt serves as our Corporate
Secretary and has been a member of our Board of Directors since 1993.  Mrs. Hunt served as Treasurer for the
University of Arkansas’ Campaign for the 21

st

Century. 
Neither of the aforementioned board members was instrumental in securing
this contribution, nor did either participate in the voting processes related
to this transaction.

In April 2004, we sold an
aircraft hanger, which we had owned since 1993. 
Net proceeds from this sale totaled $988,000 and we recognized an
approximate $532,000 gain on this sale. 
The hanger was sold to Pinnacle Air Facilities LLC (Pinnacle).  Mr. J.B. Hunt, our former Senior Chairman,
was a principal and a director of Pinnacle prior to his death in late
2006.  The selling price of the hanger
was approved by our Board of Directors and was based on a written appraisal of
the property prepared by an independent third-party appraiser.

11.

Commitments and
Contingencies

During 1999, we entered into
a sale-and-leaseback transaction for a portion of our container fleet.  Containers having a net book value of
approximately $175 million were sold to third-party leasing companies at
approximately net book value.  A gain of
approximately $600,000 on the transaction has been deferred and is amortized to
income in relation to rent expense recognized under the leases.  The containers are being leased back under operating
leases over terms of four to ten years, which began in 1999.  Approximately $11.4 million, $0 and $5.9
million of this intermodal trailing equipment was repurchased in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, we
had approximately $47.6 million of obligations remaining under operating lease
arrangements related to trailing equipment and terminal facilities.  None of our operating leases contains any
guaranteed residual value clauses.  Under
the terms of certain lease agreements, we are required to maintain certain
covenants, including minimum credit ratings. 
We were in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2006.


Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases

Total rent expense was $78.8 million in 2006, $93.5 million in 2005,

At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding commitments to acquire
approximately $135.8 million of revenue equipment and facilities in 2007.  This amount is net of expected allowances and
sales proceeds from equipment dispositions.

During 2006, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a
guarantee of our performance under certain operating lease commitments and
self-insurance arrangements.  If we
default on our commitments under the lease agreements or other arrangements, we
are required to perform under these guarantees. 
The undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make future
payments in the event of defaults is approximately $15.0 million.

As previously disclosed, an arbitration process
commenced on July 2, 2004, with the BNSF Railway (BNI).  BNI provides a significant amount of rail
transportation services to our JBI business segment.  The arbitration process was initiated in
accordance with the terms of our Joint Service Agreement (JSA) with BNI, after
we were unable to resolve our disagreements through mediation.  We announced that an interim award was issued
by the arbitration panel on September 16, 2005. 
As a result of this decision, we recorded, in the third quarter of 2005,
pretax charges of $25.8 million, or $16.5 million after income taxes.  On October 19, 2005, the arbitration panel
issued an order terminating this arbitration proceeding and declaring that the
interim award be adopted as the final award in this matter.  Normal commercial business activity between
the parties, including load tendering, load tracing, billing and payments, has
continued on a timely basis during the entire mediation and arbitration
process.

We are involved in certain other claims and
pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business.  Based on the present knowledge of the facts
and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution
of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, our results of operations or our liquidity.

12.

Affiliated Company

We have a 37% ownership interest in a
logistics joint venture called Transplace, Inc. (TPI). TPI was formed in July
2000 when we, along with five other motor carriers, contributed our existing
non-asset-based logistics business to the new entity.  No gain or loss was recognized upon the
formation of TPI.  We routinely enter
into transactions with TPI regarding the movement of freight.  We provided various services to TPI under a
shared-service agreement, primarily related to computer system operations,
services and maintenance.  We earn
transportation revenues from and purchase transportation services from TPI.  We also utilize travel services provided by
TPI.  We, along with the other motor
carriers, advanced funds to TPI in the form of a note receivable during
2005.  We have reduced the balance of
this receivable by the amount of our equity in loss of TPI during 2006.  This note receivable balance, including accrued
interest, was $5.3 million at December 31, 2006, after the reduction based on
our equity in loss of TPI, and carried an interest rate of 6.0%.  This note receivable from TPI is classified
as an other asset on


our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2006.  In January 2007, we extended the due date on
this note to January 2009.  When the note
is paid, any reduction in the value of the note as a result of our portion of
equity losses in TPI will be recovered and recorded as a gain in the period
collected.  A summary of our revenues and
expenses related to TPI for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2006, and
balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2006 and 2005, is presented below (in

Segment Information

We have three reportable business segments, Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated
Contract Services (DCS), and Truck (JBT). 
The JBI segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at
least some portion of the movement and also includes certain repositioning
truck freight moved by JBI equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway
movement is intended to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal operations.  DCS segment business typically includes
company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers that are assigned to a
specific customer, traffic lane or service. 
DCS operations usually include formal, written long-term agreements or
contracts that govern services performed and applicable rates.  JBT business includes full-load dry-van
freight that is typically transported utilizing company-owned or
company-controlled revenue equipment. 
This freight is typically transported over roads and highways and does
not move by rail.

Our customers are geographically dispersed across the United
States.  One customer accounted for
approximately 14%, 15% and 15% of consolidated operating revenues in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.  A summary of
certain segment information as of December 31, is presented below (in
