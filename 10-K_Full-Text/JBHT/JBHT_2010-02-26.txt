FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This report, including documents which
are incorporated by reference, and other documents which we file periodically
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), contains statements that may
be considered to be “forward-looking statements.”  Such statements
relate to our predictions concerning future events or operations and are within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.   Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain,
subject to risks, and should be viewed with caution.  These statements
are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently
available.  Stockholders and prospective investors are cautioned that
actual results and future events may differ materially from these
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Some of the
factors and events that are not within our control and that could have a
material impact on future operating results include:  general economic
and business conditions, competition and competitive rate fluctuations, cost and
availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and
delivery personnel, a loss of one or more major customers, interference with or
termination of our relationships with certain railroads, insurance costs and
availability, claims expense, retention of key employees, terrorist attacks or
actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, new or different environmental
or other laws and regulations, increased costs for new revenue equipment or
decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment
manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment
trade-in values.

You should understand that many
important factors, in addition to those listed above, could impact us
financially.  Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of these
and other risk factors or events as described in our filings with the
SEC.  Some important factors that could cause our actual results to
differ from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements
are described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.  We assume no
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to the extent we become aware
that it will not be achieved for any reason.

PART
I

ITEM
1.   BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We
are one of the largest surface transportation and delivery service companies in
North America.  J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is a publicly held
holding company that, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides a
wide range of transportation services to a diverse group of customers throughout
the continental United States, Canada and Mexico.  Unless otherwise
indicated by the

context, “we,” “us,” “our”
and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt

Transport Services, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries.  We were incorporated in Arkansas on August
10, 1961, and have been a publicly held company since our initial public
offering in 1983.  Our wide scope of scalable service offerings is
relatively uncommon in the industry and ranges from full-load containerized
freight transportation over highways and railroads to individual deliveries of
appliances and other items to small businesses and personal
residences.  We have arrangements with most of the major North
American rail carriers to transport freight in containers and
trailers.  We also provide customized freight movement, revenue
equipment, labor, systems and delivery services that are tailored to meet
individual customer’s requirements and typically involve longer-term
contracts.  These arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated
services and may include multiple pickups and drops, local and home deliveries,
freight handling, specialized equipment and freight network
design.  We also provide integrated capacity and comprehensive
transportation and logistics services and solutions by utilizing a network of
thousands of reliable third-party carriers.  While these unrelated
outside carriers, at times, supplement our dry-van, full-load operations, they
also provide flatbed, refrigerated, less-than-truckload (LTL) and other
specialized equipment, drivers and services.

Our business operations are primarily
organized through four distinct, but complementary, business
segments.  These segments include intermodal (JBI), dedicated contract
services (DCS), full-load dry-van (JBT) and integrated capacity solutions
(ICS).  Our business is somewhat seasonal, with slightly higher
freight volumes typically experienced during August through early
November.  Our DCS segment is subject to less seasonal variation than
our other segments.  For the calendar year ended December 31, 2009,
our consolidated revenue totaled $3.2 billion, after the elimination of
intersegment business.  Of this total, 55% was generated by our JBI
business segment, 24% by DCS, 14% by JBT and 7% by ICS.


Additional general information about us
is available on our Internet website at

www.jbhunt.com

.  We
make a number of reports and other information available free of charge on our
website, including our annual report on Form 10-K, our proxy statement and our
earnings releases.  Our website also contains corporate governance
guidelines, our code of ethics, our whistleblower policy, Board committee
charters and other corporate policies.

OUR
MISSION AND STRATEGY

We forge long-term partnerships with
key customers that include supply-chain management as an integral part of their
strategy.  Working in concert, we drive out cost, add value and
function as an extension of our customers’ enterprise.  We believe
that our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits
and returns to stockholders.

RECENT
FOCUS

Our recent focus has been to maximize
the return on our invested capital and generate free cash flow to reduce
outstanding debt.  We believe we can leverage the services of our
business units for the ultimate benefit of our customers.  We
continuously analyze where capital investments yield the best return and
allocate funds to those business units and specific activities inside the
business unit.  Unacceptable returns in various areas have caused us
to reduce certain business models or exit those activities within the business
model.  Our goal is to become more asset-light in certain of the
services we provide, but to continue to grow with new and existing customers by
providing the most efficient transportation solutions to their supply
chains.  We are encouraged by the growing number of shippers using all
of our services as a way to meet their needs and feel it is positive
confirmation of our focus and goals.

Examples of steps taken to reach those goals include the continued contraction
of the JBT business unit coupled with the growth in our ICS business unit, the
expansion of our Eastern intermodal network, and the development of our new and
existing customer base.  We also continue to direct our dedicated
business unit toward providing best-in-class service in applications that
require unique and specialized services ranging from retail and small-business
replenishment to deliveries at personal residences.  A significant
step toward this goal has been the implementation of a cross-dock and delivery
system network during 2009.  By midyear 2010, we plan to manage
delivery facilities or operations that will allow us to directly serve in excess
of 90% of the U.S. population.

Increasingly, our customers are seeking energy-efficient transportation
solutions to reduce both cost and greenhouse-gas emissions.  Our
intermodal service addresses both demands.  We are customizing
dedicated solutions aimed at minimizing transportation-related carbon
emissions.  Efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency are ongoing, and
we are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay

SM

Transport Partner.

As always, we continue to ingrain
safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as
safely as possible.

OPERATING
SEGMENTS

Segment information is also included in
Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

JBI
Segment

The transportation service offerings of our JBI segment utilize arrangements
with most major North American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight
solutions for our customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and
Mexico.  Our JBI segment began operations in 1989 with a unique
partnership with what is now the BNSF Railway Company, a watershed event in the
industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers
in a joint marketing environment.  JBI draws on the intermodal
services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment
and performs the pickups and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at the origin
and destination rail terminal locations.  We provide the drayage
service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our
company-owned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads, but utilize
third parties where economical.  Performing our own dray services
keeps costs lower and improves customer service.  JBI provides
seamless coordination of the rail and dray movements for our customers and
delivers a single billing for complete door-to-door service.


JBI operates 40,170 company-controlled
containers systemwide.  The entire fleet is comprised of 53-foot,
high-cube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal
double-stack economics and superior ride quality.  JBI also manages a
fleet of 2,303 company-owned tractors and 2,780 company drivers that provide
efficiency to our intermodal operations.  At December 31, 2009, the
total JBI employee count was 3,078.  Revenue for the JBI segment in
2009 was $1.76 billion.

DCS
Segment

DCS offers transportation services that generally are not provided by common
truckload carriers or intermodal due to strict service requirements, specialized
equipment, and intense driver and delivery personnel demands.  Our
operations are managed on site by transportation professionals who work in
concert daily with the customer and our drivers to ensure that we deliver their
product or service on time in a safe and cost-effective manner.  All
operations are governed by longer-term contracts that typically include fixed
cost components related to dedicated specialized equipment and fuel surcharge
programs on round-trip miles.  During 2009, we commenced the
implementation of significantly more new business than we have in any other
prior year.  As a result of this growth, our final-mile delivery
channel business became a significant part of our DCS business.

At December 31, 2009, this segment
operated 3,969 company-controlled trucks, 358 customer-owned trucks, and 31
independent contractor trucks.  The DCS segment employed 5,765 people
at December 31, 2009.  DCS revenue for 2009 was $757
million.

JBT
Segment

The
service offering in this segment is full-load, dry-van freight, utilizing
tractors operating over roads and highways.  We typically pick up
freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load
directly to the location of the consignee.  We use our company-owned
tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport
freight in our trailers.

At
December 31, 2009, the JBT segment operated 1,698 company-owned tractors and
employed 2,150 people, 1,823 of whom were drivers.  At December 31,
2009, we had 1,163 independent contractors operating in the JBT segment, some of
whom were leasing company-owned tractors.  JBT revenue for 2009 was
$447 million.

ICS
Segment

ICS provides non-asset, asset-light, and transportation logistics solutions to
customers through relationships with thousands of third-party carriers and
integration with our owned equipment.  By leveraging the J.B. Hunt
brand, systems and network, ICS brings a broader service offering to customers
by providing flatbed, refrigerated, expedited and LTL, as well as a variety of
dry-van and intermodal solutions.  ICS provides single-source
logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their transportation
functions and utilize our proven supply-chain, technology, and design expertise
to improve efficiency.  ICS operates outside offices as well as
on-site logistics personnel working in direct contact with
customers.

At December 31, 2009, the ICS segment
employed 323 people, with a carrier base in excess of 22,400.  ICS
revenue for 2009 was $259 million.


Marketing
and Operations

We transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of
freight, including general merchandise, specialty consumer items, appliances,
forest and paper products, food and beverages, building materials, soaps and
cosmetics, automotive parts, electronics, and chemicals.  Our customer
base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of Fortune 500
companies.  Our ability to offer multiple services, utilizing our four
business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third
parties, represents a competitive advantage.  We provide a broad range
of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number
of “core” carriers and those that desire a provider of complementary services as
a way to meet all of their supply-chain needs.  We had no customers
that represented 10% or more of our total revenue in 2009.

We generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and
marketing network.  We use a specific sales force in DCS due to the
length, complexity and specialization of the sales cycle.  In
addition, ICS utilizes its own proactive local branch salespeople.  In
accordance with our typical arrangements, we bill the customer for all services
and we, in turn, pay all third parties for their portion of transportation
services provided.

People

We believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is
our service-oriented people.  As of December 31, 2009, we had 14,171
employees, including 9,287 company drivers, 1,210 mechanics and 3,674 office
personnel.  We also had arrangements with approximately 1,200
independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing
equipment.  None of our employees is represented by unions or covered
by collective bargaining agreements.

Revenue
Equipment

Our JBI segment utilizes high-cube containers, which can be separated from the
chassis and double-stacked on rail cars.  The composition of our DCS
trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include
dry-vans, flatbeds, temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, straight trucks
and dump trailers.  Our JBT segment operates primarily with 53-foot
dry-van trailers.  We primarily utilize third-party carriers’ tractor
and trailing equipment for our ICS segment.

As of
December 31, 2009, our company-owned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 7,970
units.  In addition, we had approximately 1,200 independent
contractors who operate their own tractors, but transport freight in our
trailing equipment.  We operate with standardized tractors in as many
fleets as possible, particularly in our JBI and JBT fleets.  Due to
our customers’ preferences and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is
extremely diversified.  We believe that operating with relatively
newer revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts quality
drivers and lowers maintenance expense.  At December 31, 2009, the
average age of our combined tractor fleet was 2.7 years, our containers averaged
5.4 years of age and our trailers averaged 7.9 years.  We perform
routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at most of our
regional terminal facilities.

Effective with model-year 2010 engines, the EPA has mandated lower emission
standards for newly manufactured heavy-duty tractors.  The 2010
EPA-compliant engines are expected to have a slight increase in miles per gallon
and an increase in operating costs compared with current engine standards due to
Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology, which achieves lower
emissions.  At this time, we have not taken delivery of any EPA 2010
model engines, but plan on doing so later in 2010.

Competition
and the Industry

The freight transportation markets in
which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and
competitive.  Our JBI segment competes with other intermodal marketing
companies as well as other full-load carriers that utilize railroads for a
portion of the transportation service.  Considering the diversified
nature of the services provided by our DCS segment, competition ranges from
large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service
carriers.  Our ICS segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck
industry and competes with other non-asset-based logistics companies and freight
brokers, as well as full-load carriers.  The full-load freight
competition of our JBT segment includes thousands of carriers, many of which are
very small.  While we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a
regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent competition in all
markets across the country.


We compete with other transportation
service companies primarily in terms of price, on-time pickup and delivery
service, revenue equipment quality and availability of carriers for logistics
services.

Regulation

Our operations as a for-hire motor
carrier are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and certain
business is also subject to state rules and regulations.  The DOT
periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all
federal safety requirements, and we report certain accident and other
information to the DOT.  Our operations into and out of Canada and
Mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries.

In November 2008, the FMCSA adopted
final provisions of the Agency’s December 17, 2007, interim final rule
concerning hours of service for commercial vehicle drivers.  This
final rule allows drivers to continue to drive up to 11 hours within a 14-hour
nonextendable window from the start of the workday, following at least 10
consecutive hours off duty.  The rule also allows motor carriers and
drivers to continue to restart calculations of weekly on-duty limits after the
driver has at least 34 consecutive hours off duty.  The rule was
effective January 19, 2009.  We believe we are in compliance with all
applicable regulations and continue to monitor the actions of the
FMCSA.

ITEM
1A.   RISK FACTORS

In addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in this Form
10-K and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk
factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our
business.  Our business, financial condition or financial results
could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.

Our
business is subject to general economic and business factors, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Economic
trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect
our ability, and the ability of our suppliers, to obtain financing for
operations and capital expenditures.

Our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material
adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our
control.  These factors include interference with, or termination of,
our relationships with certain railroads, significant increases or rapid
fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes, interest rates, insurance premiums,
self-insurance levels, excess capacity in the trucking industry, license and
registration fees, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse weather
conditions, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value
of used equipment, surpluses in the market for used equipment, and difficulty in
attracting and retaining qualified drivers, independent contractors and
third-party carriers.

We are also affected by recessionary
economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in
market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a
significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions represent
a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for
bad debt losses.  In addition, our results of operations may be
affected by seasonal factors.  Customers tend to reduce shipments
after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in
the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel
consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.


We
depend on third parties in the operation of our business.

Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its
transportation services.  The majority of these services are provided
pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads.  While we
have agreements with various Class I railroads, the majority of our business
travels on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern
railways.  The inability to utilize one or more of these railroads
could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating
results.  In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported
to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union
contracts.  Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our ICS business segment utilizes third-party carriers.  Aside from
periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads, we do not own
the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering the
loads.  The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers could
have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business
growth.

Rapid
changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.

Fuel costs can be very volatile.  We have a fuel surcharge revenue
program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically
enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs.  Most of
these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of
fuel.  However, there can be timing differences between a change in
our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our
customers.  In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price
increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold
or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to
customers.  Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could
have a material adverse effect on our operations or future
profitability.  As of December 31, 2009, we had no derivative
financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price
fluctuations.

Ongoing
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our
earnings.

Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which
could reduce our earnings.  During 2007, the self-insured portion of
our claims exposure for all claims was $500,000 per
occurrence.  During 2008 and 2009, the self-insured portion of our
claims was $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and
$1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation.  If the number or
severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating
results could be adversely affected.  We have renewed our policies for
2010 with substantially the same terms as our 2009 policies for personal injury
and property damage.  We have reduced the self-insured portion of our
workers’ compensation claims exposure and are substantially fully insured for
claims in 2010.  We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above
which we are self-insured.  If these expenses increase and we are
unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be
materially and adversely affected.

We
derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss
of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

For the calendar year ended December 31, 2009, our top 10 customers, based on
revenue, accounted for approximately 33% of our revenue.  Our JBI, JBT
and ICS segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their
customers.  While our DCS segment business may involve a written
contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no
assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or
continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our
services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse
effect on our business and operating results.


We
operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of
compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business,
generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier
service, equipment operation, safety and financial reporting.  We are
audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various
safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were
found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our
operations.

Significant
changes in hours-of-service regulations and other motor carrier safety
regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver
productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping
equipment.

In January 2010, a set of more stringent emissions standards became effective
for model-year 2010 manufactured tractor engines.  While it is too
early to assess the impact of the new standards, our fuel costs, operating costs
and acquisition costs could be impacted.

Our
operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the
violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the
handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge
and retention of storm water.  We operate in industrial areas, where
truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where
groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have
occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or
seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among
others.  We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at
several of our facilities.  If a spill or other accident involving
hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable
laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and
operating results.  If we should fail to comply with applicable
environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties
and to civil and criminal liability.

Difficulty
in attracting and retaining drivers, delivery personnel and third-party carriers
could affect our profitability and ability to grow.

If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary number of employees or
contract with enough independent contractors, we could be required to
significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment
sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether, which could adversely affect
our growth and profitability.  In addition, our ICS segment growth
could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we
rely to provide transportation services.

We
operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry.  Numerous
factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to
compete with other carriers and private fleets.

We
compete with many other transportation services providers of varying sizes and,
to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more
equipment and greater capital resources than we do.  Additionally,
some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain
business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which
may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our
profit margins.

In an
effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects
so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in
some instances we may not be selected.  Many customers periodically
accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process
may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to
competitors.  Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to
transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby
reducing their need for our services.


Extreme
or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes
and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business results.

Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our
operations.  Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing
and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter
months.  Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also
impact freight volumes and increase our costs.

ITEM
2.   PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas.  We occupy a
number of buildings in Lowell that we utilize for administrative support,
customer service, freight dispatch, and data processing and
warehousing.  We maintain a backup data center for disaster recovery,
maintenance shop and driver operations facility in Lowell.  We also
own or lease approximately 30 other significant facilities across the United
States where we perform maintenance on our equipment, provide bulk fuel and
employ personnel to support operations.  These facilities vary from
one to 35 acres in size.  Each of our business segments utilizes our
larger facilities for services including bulk fueling, maintenance and driver
support activities.  In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we have
leased approximately 80 facilities in connection with the development of our
cross-dock and delivery system network implemented in 2009.  Excluded
from the table that follows are leases for a number of small offices and parking
yards throughout the country that support our customers’ business
needs.

ITEM
3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a defendant in certain class-action
allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former California-based
drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages, failure to provide meal and rest
periods, and other items.  Further proceedings have been stayed in
these matters pending the California Supreme Court’s decision in a case
unrelated to ours involving similar issues.  We cannot reasonably
estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may arise
from these lawsuits.

We are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal
conduct of business.  Based on present knowledge of the facts and, in
certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of claims
and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity 2009

Dividend
Policy

Our
dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors, and
payments are dependent upon our financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant.  On February 4, 2010, we announced an increase in our
quarterly cash dividend from $0.11 to $0.12, which was paid February 26, 2010,
to stockholders of record on February 12, 2010.  We currently intend
to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis.  However, no
assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.

Purchases
of Equity Securities

During
calendar year 2007, we purchased approximately $603 million of our common stock
in accordance with plans authorized by our Board.  All plans have been
completed and there were no stock purchases during calendar years 2008 and
2009.

ITEM
7.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The
following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should
be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in Item
8.  This discussion contains forward-looking
statements.  Please see “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk
Factors” for a discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks
associated with these statements.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported
in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.  Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are
affected by these estimates.  We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties
and other methods considered reasonable in the particular
circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly
from our estimates.  Any effects on our business, financial position
or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are
recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known.  We consider our critical accounting policies
and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and
estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the
following:

Workers’
Compensation and Accident Costs

We
purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee
injuries (workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and cargo
claims.  Most of our insurance arrangements include a level of
self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but provide an
umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are
completely insured.  Excluding new policies entered into and
applicable to claims incurred in 2010, our policies also include a contractual
premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of
48 months from each policy period inception.  This contractual premium
adjustment factor is used to convert the self-insured losses to fully insured
losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims.  Our
estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors
as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur.


The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain
measurement dates and policy expiration dates.  During 2007, we were
self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury, property damage
and workers’ compensation.  For 2008 and 2009, we were self-insured
for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and $1
million for workers’ compensation.  We have renewed our policies for
2010 with substantially the same terms as our 2009 policies for personal injury
and property damage.  We have reduced the self-insured portion of our
workers’ compensation claims exposure and are substantially fully insured for
claims in 2010.

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a
liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and
severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims
administrators, as well as legal, economic and regulatory
factors.  Our safety and claims personnel work directly with
representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated
cost of each claim.  The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time
as additional information regarding the nature, timing and extent of damages
claimed becomes available.  Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to
develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim
liability.  This process involves the use of loss-development factors
based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium
adjustment factor mentioned above.  In doing so, the recorded
liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status
and provides an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims.  We do
not discount our estimated losses.  At December 31, 2009, we had an
accrual of approximately $19 million for estimated net claims.  In
addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly
premiums.  At December 31, 2009, we had a prepaid insurance asset of
approximately $32 million, which represented prefunded claims and
premiums.  We are also substantially self-insured for loss of and
damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.

Revenue
Equipment

We
operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers and trailers in
connection with our business.  This equipment may be purchased or
acquired under operating lease agreements.  In addition, we may rent
revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short-term
rental arrangements.  Revenue equipment that is purchased is
depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life down to
an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  We periodically review the
useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our
long-lived assets for impairment.  See Note 2, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a discussion
of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment.  We have not identified
any impairment to our remaining assets at December 31, 2009.

We have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade-in
values for certain new equipment.  We have utilized these trade-in
values, as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual
miles, in accounting for depreciation expense.  If our tractor
supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade-in
values, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial
results.

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported
and as other services are provided.  Accordingly, a portion of the
total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is
recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight
pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting
period.

We record
revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are
the primary obligor, we are a principal in the transaction, we invoice our
customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over
pricing.  Additionally, we are responsible for carrier selection with
respect to our ICS business.


Our trade
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers which have been reduced
by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue
adjustments.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue
adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or
uncertainties related to customer billing and account
collectibility.  The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed
quarterly.

Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method in accordance with
current accounting standards.  Our deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future
years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in
our statement of earnings.  Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of
timing differences between when items are recognized in our Consolidated
Financial Statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax
returns.  We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be
recovered from future taxable income.  To the extent we believe
recovery does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance
is established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an
expense as part of our income tax provision.

Significant
judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws
and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income
taxes.  As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes,
we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely
than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax
position.  For tax positions that are more likely than not of being
sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more
likely than not of being sustained in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments,
whereby actual results could vary materially from these
estimates.  Further, a number of years may elapse before a particular
matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and
resolved.  See Note 6, Income Taxes, in our Consolidated Financial
Statements, for a discussion of our current tax
contingencies.

YEAR
IN REVIEW

Significant
events for calendar year 2009 include:

·

Expanded
      Intermodal services network in the Eastern
  region

·

Substantially
      implemented a comprehensive, nationwide, cross-dock and final-mile
      delivery system network in our DCS
segment

·

Continued
      revenue and services growth in our non-asset ICS
  segment

·

Decline
      in rates due to freight recession and related price
    pressures

·

Designated
      approximately 700 tractors to be sold or traded in connection with our
      strategy to reduce our fleet size to the appropriate
  level

·

Reduced
      our total debt by approximately $69 million, or
  11%

·

Increased
      our quarterly dividend to $0.11 per share in January 2009 from $0.10 in
      2008, and announced an increase to $0.12 per share effective February

Our 2009
net earnings of $136.4 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, were down 32% from
the $200.6 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, earned in
2008.  Pricing pressure and resulting margin contraction aggravated by
the ongoing recession contributed significantly to the decline in earnings for
the current year.  While we made strides in controlling and reducing
operating expenses in light of the economic conditions, the pricing pressure
experienced by each of our operating segments was our largest challenge in
2009.


Freight
demand during 2009 was up for our JBI and ICS segments compared with 2008, while
demand for DCS and JBT was softer, particularly during the first half of
2009.  Although loads were up for JBI, operating income decreased 28%,
which was primarily the result of rate decreases from an extremely competitive
bid season and due to charges to write down the value of equipment held for
sale.  DCS showed a decline in operating income of 32%, which was due
to lower business demand levels, increased implementation costs for on-boarding
new business, and charges to write down the value of equipment held for
sale.  JBT reported an operating loss due primarily to decreased
rates, which was partly offset by cost-control measures implemented in
2009.  Our ICS segment grew operating income by 23%, primarily due to
revenue and volume growth.

In
response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments
that produce the greatest return on invested capital, we increased our JBI
tractor and container counts by 5% and 3%, respectively, as well as increased
our DCS trailer count by 7%.  We reduced our JBT company-owned tractor
fleet by 35%, excluding tractors designated as held for sale.  We were
able to effect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our
fleets.

Our 2009 consolidated operating ratio (operating expenses divided by total
operating revenues) was 92.3%, compared with 90.4% in 2008.  Our 2009
operating income reflected $10.3 million of pretax charges to write down the
value of certain assets held for sale.  Operating income in 2008
reflected $3.9 million of pretax charges related to assets held for
sale.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth items in
our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues
and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the
prior year.


Compared With 2008

Consolidated
Operating Revenues

Our total consolidated operating
revenues were $3.2 billion in 2009, a 14.2% decrease from
2008.  Significantly lower fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge
(FSC) revenues of $326 million in 2009, compared with $730 million in
2008.  This change in FSC revenue impacted our year-to-year
comparison.  If FSC revenues were excluded from both years, our 2009
revenue decreased 4% from 2008.  While load volume increased 9.3% and
69.0% in 2009 for JBI and ICS, respectively, we experienced a decrease in
revenue in all segments except ICS.  The decreases in our JBI, DCS and
JBT segments were primarily a result of competitive rates, as well as decreased
activity for certain customers due to the overall economic
recession.  In addition, JBT segment revenue decreased as a result of
reduced tractor utilization and our continued effort to reduce the size of the
JBT segment to an appropriate level for our service offerings.

Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Our 2009 consolidated operating expenses decreased 12.4% from
2008.  The impact of this decrease, and the 14.2% decrease in 2009
revenue from 2008, resulted in an increase in our operating ratio to 92.3% from
90.4% in 2008.  Rents and purchased transportation costs decreased
5.5% in 2009, primarily due to lower payments made to railroads and drayage
companies.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase related
to third-party carriers servicing ICS due to growth in that
segment.  The total cost of salaries, wages and employee benefits
decreased 7.1% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to decreases in total driver
pay.  This reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a
33% decrease in the number of drivers in the JBT segment.

Fuel and
fuel taxes expense decreased 47.5% in 2009, primarily due to a 36.7% lower fuel
cost per gallon and slightly higher fuel miles per gallon.  We have
fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our
customers.  These programs typically involve a specified computation
based on the change in national, regional or local fuel prices.  While
these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly, most
also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum
change in fuel costs (e.g., $0.05 per gallon) to trigger a change in fuel
surcharge revenue.  As a result, some of these programs have a time
lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in
revenues.  Due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts
operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively
impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly.

It is not
meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel
surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or
the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel
costs is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third
parties. These payments are classified as purchased transportation
expense.

Depreciation
and amortization expense decreased 6.5%, which was primarily the result of the
reduction of our tractor fleet related to the rightsizing of the JBT
segment.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the
container and chassis depreciation due to volume growth in the JBI
segment.  Operating supplies and expenses decreased 4.0%, primarily
due to decreased costs of driver expenses and toll
expenses.  Insurance and claims expense decreased 16.4% for 2009, due
to fewer accidents and lower claims costs.  The 14.6% increase in
general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the 2009 charges to
write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with
the 2008 write-down.  During 2009 and 2008, these pretax write-down
charges were $10.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively.  In
addition, 2009 included losses on asset sales of $0.4 million, compared with
gains on asset sales of $1.2 million in 2008.

Net
interest expense for 2009 decreased by 20.6% compared with 2008.  This
decrease was primarily due to reduced outstanding debt balances and reduced
interest rates on our variable rate debt.  The decrease was partially
offset by the effect of a refund in 2008 related to a prior-period tax
settlement.


The
“equity in operations of affiliated company” item on our Consolidated Statement
of Earnings reflects our share of the operating results of Transplace, Inc.
(TPI).  We owned a 37% equity interest in this global transportation
and logistics company.  The increase in 2009 compared with 2008 was
primarily due to certain transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009, which were
treated as a sale of all interests in this logistics company.  These
transactions resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $3.3 million during
2009.  See Note 12, Affiliated Company, in our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information on these transactions.

Our
effective income tax rate was 39.1% in 2009 and 37.8% in 2008.  The
increase in 2009 was partly related to the previously mentioned transactions
with TPI.  These transactions resulted in a valuation allowance on the
deferred tax benefits on our balance sheet.  We expect our effective
income tax rate to approximate 38.5% for calendar year 2010.

Segments

We operated four business segments
during calendar year 2009.  The operation of each of these businesses
is described in our notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The following tables summarize financial and operating

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue decreased 9.6% to $1.76 billion in 2009, from $1.95 billion
in 2008.  A significant portion of this decline in revenue related to
decreased fuel surcharge revenue due to reduced fuel costs.  Excluding
fuel surcharge revenue, JBI segment revenue increased 1% in 2009 from
2008.  Although load counts increased 9.3%, revenue per load decreased
17.3% and average length of haul decreased 2.6%.

Operating income in our JBI segment
declined to $183 million in 2009, from $254 million in
2008.  Declining rates and a pretax charge to write down the value of
certain equipment held for sale contributed to our operating income decreasing
by 27.8% in 2009.

DCS
Segment

DCS
segment revenue declined 18.3% to $757 million in 2009, from $927 million in
2008.  Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, DCS segment revenue decreased
9% in 2009 from 2008.  This decrease in revenue was primarily due to a
6.3% decrease in average truck count and lower load counts as we worked with our
customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses.

Operating income decreased to $63 million in 2009, compared with $92 million in
2008.  This decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue,
higher implementation expenses for new and expanded contracts, increased
operating costs for facilities, and a pretax charge to write down the value of
certain equipment held for sale.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined 34.0% to
$447 million in 2009, from $676 million in 2008.  The decrease in
revenue was the result of a 19.9% decrease in load count due to much softer
demand in 2009 than in 2008, as well as significant decreases in
rates.

Our JBT segment had an operating loss of $11 million in 2009, compared to
operating income of $1.4 million in 2008, mainly a result of reduced rates and a
reduction in revenue due to lower tractor count and utilization.  This
decrease in operating income was partially offset by cost-controlling measures
implemented to reduce hiring costs and other operating costs.

ICS
Segment

ICS segment revenue grew 23.8% to $259
million in 2009, from $209 million in 2008.  This increase in revenue
was primarily due to a 69% increase in load volume from both new and existing
customers.

Operating income increased 22.6% to $13 million in 2009, compared with $11
million in 2008.  The large revenue growth was partially offset by
increased operating expenses, including higher personnel and technology costs
related to growing and investing in the ICS segment.  In 2009, we
continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began
to cover related increases in operating expenses.


Compared With 2007

Consolidated
Operating Revenues

Our total consolidated operating revenues rose to $3.7 billion in 2008, a 6.9%
increase over 2007.  Significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel
surcharge (FSC) revenues of $730 million in 2008, compared with $480 million in
2007.  If FSC revenues were excluded from both years, our 2008 revenue
decreased less than 1% from 2007.  A 13.5% and 117.3% increase in 2008
JBI and ICS load volume, respectively, contributed to our higher levels of
revenue.  The increases in revenue of our JBI and ICS segments were
partially offset by decreases in our DCS segment as a result of decreased
activity for delivery service accounts due to the overall economic slowdown and
weak housing market.  Our JBT segment revenue decreased as a result of
rate declines and reduced tractor utilization, due to decreasing freight
demand.

Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Our total 2008 consolidated operating expenses increased 8.1% over 2007 and
offset the impact of the 6.9% increase in 2008 revenue over 2007 that resulted
in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 90.4% from 89.4% in
2007.  Rents and purchased transportation costs rose 19.7% in 2008,
primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads, drayage companies and
third-party carriers servicing ICS.  The total cost of salaries, wages
and employee benefits decreased 3.3% in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to
decreases in total driver pay.  This reduction in total driver pay was
primarily the result of a 24% decrease in the number of drivers in the JBT
segment.

Fuel and
fuel taxes expense increased 12.3% in 2008, primarily due to 29.7% higher fuel
cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.

The 1.4%
decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to fewer tractors
owned in our JBT and DCS segments.  Operating supplies and expenses
rose 1.5% in 2008, primarily as a result of increased costs in airfare and
travel expenses.  Insurance and claims expense decreased 12.8% due to
fewer accidents and lower claims costs.  The 14.2% decrease in general
and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in other driving
expenses as a result of a decrease in the number of drivers, and a decrease in
the charge to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale
compared with the 2007 write-down.  In addition, gains on asset sales
were $1.2 million in 2008 compared with losses on asset sales of $0.4 million in
2007.

Net
interest expense for 2008 decreased by 18.9% compared with 2007.  This
decrease was due to reduced outstanding debt balances, as well as reduced
interest rates on our variable rate debt.  Interest expense was
further reduced by a refund of interest previously paid to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) from the 1999 tax case settlement and lower accrued interest on
uncertain tax positions.

Our
effective income tax rate was 37.8% in 2008 and 34.4% in 2007.  The
increase in 2008 was primarily due to the 2007 rate being reduced by our 1999
tax case settlement in 2007.

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 18.1% to $1.95 billion in 2008, from $1.65 billion
in 2007.  A significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a
13.5% increase in load volume.  The remaining portion of revenue
growth was primarily the result of a 4.1% increase in revenue per load,
including fuel surcharges, partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in the average
length of haul.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose to $254 million in 2008, from $239
million in 2007.  While increased volumes contributed to higher
operating margins, we were able to increase our driver productivity and
significantly reduce our reliance on third-party equipment and
drayage.  All of these factors contributed to our operating income
increasing by 6.3% in 2008.


DCS
Segment

DCS segment revenue declined 1.0% to
$927 million in 2008, from $937 million in 2007.  This decrease in
revenue was primarily due to an 8.8% decrease in average length of haul and
lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet
size for their businesses.

Operating income decreased to $92 million in 2008, compared with $94 million in
2007.  This decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue
and higher fuel and operating costs.  These higher operating expenses,
relative to 2007, were offset by decreases in equipment rental costs and lower
insurance and claim costs.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined 19.6% to
$676 million in 2008, from $842 million in 2007.  The decrease in
revenue was primarily the result of a 20.9% decrease in load count due to much
softer demand in 2008 than in 2007.

Operating income in our JBT segment
declined to $1.4 million in 2008, from $32 million in 2007, mainly due to
reduced revenue and higher fuel costs.

ICS
Segment

ICS segment revenue grew 128.5% to $209
million in 2008, from $92 million in 2007.  This increase in revenue
was primarily due to a 117.3% increase in load volume from both new and existing
customers.

Operating income increased nearly 146% to $11 million in 2008, compared with $4
million in 2007.  The large revenue growth was partially offset by
increased operating expenses, including higher personnel and technology costs
related to growing and investing in the ICS segment.  In 2008, we
continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began
to cover higher operating expenses.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities was $357 million in 2009, $505 million
in 2008 and $458 million in 2007.  The decrease in 2009 cash provided
by operating activities relative to 2008, after consideration of adjustments for
noncash items such as depreciation, share-based compensation and impairment
charges, was due primarily to decreased earnings and the timing of cash activity
related to trade accounts receivable and tax payments.

Cash
flows used in investing activities primarily reflected additions to, net of
disposals from, our fleet of revenue equipment.  The higher level of
cash used in investing activities during 2009 partly reflected our strategy to
increase containers and chassis in our JBI segment as well as additional
investments in specialized revenue equipment for new DCS customers.

Net cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased from 2008, primarily
due to larger repayments on our revolving lines of credit in
2008.  This decrease was partially offset by increases in dividends
paid in 2009 as a result of the increase to $0.11 per share quarterly cash
dividend from $0.10 per share in 2008.

Our
dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors and
payments are dependent upon our financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant.  We paid a $0.09 per share quarterly dividend in 2007, a
$0.10 per share quarterly dividend in 2008 and an $0.11 per share quarterly
dividend in 2009.  On February 4, 2010, we announced an increase in
our quarterly cash dividend from $0.11 to $0.12, which was paid on February 26,
2010.  We currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a
quarterly basis.  However, no assurance can be given that future
dividends will be paid.


Liquidity

Our need
for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment
required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new,
late-model equipment.  We are frequently able to accelerate or
postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market
conditions.  We have, during the past few years, obtained capital
through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit and long-term
debt issuances.  We have also periodically utilized operating leases
to acquire revenue equipment.

At
December 31, 2009, we were authorized to borrow up to $350 million under a
revolving line of credit, which expires March 29, 2012.  The
applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate
or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on
the level of borrowings and our credit rating.  At December 31, 2009,
we had $165.0 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 0.74% under
this agreement.

Effective
June 29, 2009, we terminated a $75 million accounts receivable securitization
facility.  Concurrent with this termination, we dissolved a wholly
owned subsidiary, JBH Receivables LLC, which was formed in July 2006 as a
bankruptcy remote entity associated with the accounts receivable securitization
facility.

In March
2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31% Senior notes (2011 Notes), which mature
March 29, 2011, to various purchasers through a private-placement offering
pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated March 15, 2007.  The
proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases
and for general working capital purposes.  The 2011 Notes were issued
at par value.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in March and
September of each year.

In July
2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08% Senior notes (2014 Notes), which mature July
26, 2014, to various purchasers through a private-placement offering pursuant to
our note purchase agreement dated July 15, 2007.  Proceeds from these notes
were used to purchase shares of our common stock, pay down existing debt on our
revolving-credit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue
equipment.  Principal payments in the amount of $50.0 million are due
July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder due upon
maturity.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in January and July
of each year.

Our $100
million term loan facility, which was arranged in connection with our purchase
of used, dry-van trailers, matured September 29,
2009.    The balance due at maturity of $61.5 million was
paid during September 2009 reducing the balance to zero.  Concurrent
with the loan and credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that expired when the related term loan matured.

Our
revolving lines of credit and other debt facilities require us to maintain
certain covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all
covenants and financial ratios at December 31, 2009.

We
believe that our liquid assets, cash generated from operations and revolving
lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital
requirements for the foreseeable future.  The increase in our working
capital ratio from 2008 was primarily driven by our decrease in current debt
outstanding as a result of payments on the term loan in 2009.

We are
currently committed to spend approximately $132 million, net of proceeds from
sales or trade-ins during 2010, which is primarily related to tractors and
containers.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

Our only
off-balance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases, primarily for
facilities.  As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $15.6
million of obligations on the facilities leases.

Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a
Codification of FASB Accounting Standards and the Hierarchy of GAAP, which
establishes the Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP
recognized by the FASB.  SEC rules and interpretive releases are also
sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  The Codification
became effective for us beginning July 1, 2009. The Codification is not intended
to change or alter existing GAAP and accordingly, it did not impact our results
of operations, cash flows or financial position.  We have adjusted
historical GAAP references in this annual report to reflect authoritative
guidance included in the Codification.

In May
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to subsequent events, which
became effective for us during the second quarter of 2009.  This
guidance sets forth the circumstances and the period after the balance sheet
date for which an entity should evaluate events for recognition or disclosure in
its financial statements.  In addition, the guidance identifies the
disclosures that an entity should make about such events.  We have
evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 2009, through February 26, 2010,
when the financial statements were issued, in accordance with this
guidance.  Adoption did not have an effect on our financial
results.

We
adopted the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1,
2009.  Adoption of this guidance increased our disclosures regarding
fair value instruments, but did not have an effect on our operating income or
net earnings.  See Note 7, Fair Value Measurements, for more
description.

ITEM
7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK

Of our
total $565.0 million of debt, we had $165.0 million of variable rate debt
outstanding at December 31, 2009, under our revolving lines of
credit.  The interest rates applicable to these agreements are based
on either the prime rate or LIBOR.  Our earnings would be affected by
changes in these short-term interest rates.  Risk can be quantified by
measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse increase in short-term
interest rates.  At our current level of borrowing, a 1% increase in
our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately $1.7
million.  Our remaining debt is fixed rate debt, and therefore changes
in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest
expense.  Periodically, we enter into derivative instruments in
response to market interest rates; however, at December 31, 2009, we had no such
derivative financial instruments in place.


Although
we conduct business in foreign countries, international operations are not
material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.  Additionally, foreign currency transaction gains and losses
were not material to our results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2009.  Accordingly, we are not currently subject to material foreign
currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of
foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we
would receive from our foreign investment.  To date, we have not
entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative
financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates.

The price
and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in
the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather and other market
factors.  Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of
fuel-price increases from our customers in the form of fuel
surcharges.  We cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price
levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could
be collected to offset such increases.  As of December 31, 2009, we
had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price
fluctuations.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009.  In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

.  Based on our assessment, we believe that as of
December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm that also audited our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s report on internal control over
financial reporting is included herein.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during
the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Corporate
Governance

In complying with the rules and
regulations required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, NASDAQ, Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and others, we have attempted to do so in a
manner that clearly meets legal requirements but does not create a bureaucracy
of forms, checklists and other inefficient or expensive
procedures.  We have adopted a code of conduct, code of ethics,
whistleblower policy and charters for all of our Board of Director Committees
and other formal policies and procedures.  Most of these items are
available on our Company website,

www.jbhunt.com

.  If
we make significant amendments to our code of ethics or whistleblower policy, or
grant any waivers to these items, we will disclose such amendments or waivers on
our website or in a report on Form 8-K within four days of such
action.

INDEX TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION


MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related information appearing in this
report.  We take these responsibilities very seriously and are
committed to maintaining controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that we collect the information we are required to disclose in our reports to
the SEC and to process, summarize and disclose this information within the time
periods specified by the SEC.

Based on
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, and conducted by our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
believe that our controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are
able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed with the SEC within the required time
periods.

We are
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Our internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of
Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.  We assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009.  In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

.  Based on our assessment, we believe that as of
December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm that also audited our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s report on internal control over
financial reporting is included herein.


Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As
reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 48
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (codified in FASB ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes) in 2007.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.

We have
audited J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and
the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and our
report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Business

J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. is one of the largest surface transportation and
delivery service companies in North America.  We operate four
distinct, but complementary, business segments and provide a wide range of
general and specifically tailored freight and logistics services to our
customers.  We generate revenues primarily from the actual movement of
freight from shippers to consignees, customized

labor and delivery
services, and from serving as a logistics provider by offering or arranging for
others to provide the transportation service.  Unless otherwise
indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

2.

Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Consolidation

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all of our wholly
owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use
      of Estimates

The
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  The preparation of these statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that directly affect the amounts reported in such
statements and accompanying notes.  We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and using
other methods we consider reasonable in the particular
circumstances.  Nevertheless, our actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.

We
believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more significance
in our financial statement preparation process than others.  We
believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates include the
economic useful lives and salvage values of our assets, provisions for
uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of exposures under our insurance
and claims policies, and estimates for taxes.  To the extent that
actual, final outcomes are different than our estimates, or that additional
facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during
that accounting period will be affected.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash in
excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly
liquid investments.  We consider all highly liquid investments
purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Accounts
      Receivable Allowance

Our trade
accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for
uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments.  The allowance for
uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience
as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and
account collectibility.  The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed
quarterly.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue
adjustments was $6.0 million and $5.2 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Inventory

Our
inventories consist primarily of revenue equipment parts, tires, supplies and
fuel and are valued using the lower of average cost or market.

Investments
in Marketable Equity Securities

Our
investments consist of marketable equity securities stated at fair value and are
designated as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities at the
time of purchase based upon the intended holding period.  Changes in
fair value of our trading securities are recognized currently in “general and
administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions” in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings.  Changes in the fair value of our
available-for-sale securities are recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive
income” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless we determine that an
unrealized loss is other-than-temporary.  If we determine that an
unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, we recognize the loss in
earnings.  Cost basis is determined using average cost.


At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $0 and $1.9 million, respectively, of
available-for-sale securities.  See Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans,
for a discussion of our trading securities.

Property
and Equipment

Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of 4 to 10 years for tractors and 7 to 20 years for
trailing equipment, 10 to 40 years for structures and improvements, and 3 to 10
years for furniture and office equipment.  Salvage values are
typically 10% to 20% of original cost for tractors and trailing equipment and
reflect any agreements with tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values
for certain new equipment.  We capitalize tires placed in service on
new revenue equipment as a part of the equipment cost.  Replacement
tires and costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are
placed in service.  Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition
of equipment are recognized at the time of the disposition and are classified in
general and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue based on relative
transit time in each reporting period and as other services are provided, with
expenses recognized as incurred.  Accordingly, a portion of the total
revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is
recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight
pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting
period.

We record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers
because we are the primary obligor, we are a principal in the transaction, we
invoice our customers and retain all credit risks, and we maintain discretion
over pricing.  Additionally, we are responsible for carrier selection
with respect to our ICS business.

Derivative
Instruments

We
account for derivatives in accordance with current accounting standards for
derivative instruments and hedging activities.  We periodically
utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest
rates.  At inception of a derivative contract, we document
relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative
transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined
that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases
to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting
prospectively.  In 2006, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed interest
rate.  This derivative instrument was accounted for as a cash flow
hedge.  The interest rate swap expired in September 2009, when the
related term loan balance was paid.  We had no derivative instruments
in place at December 31, 2009.

Income
Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability
method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that
includes the enactment date.

Earnings
Per Share

We
compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings available to common
stockholders by the actual weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the reporting period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if holders of unvested restricted share
units or options exercised or converted their holdings into common stock.
Outstanding unvested restricted share units and stock options represent the
dilutive effects on weighted average shares. A reconciliation of the number of
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is shown below (in
thousands):

Concentrations
      of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk,
include trade receivables.  For the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for
approximately 33%, 35% and 38%, respectively, of our total
revenue.  Our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for
approximately 28% and 27% of our total trade accounts receivable for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  One customer
accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 12% of our total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Each of our
four business segments conducts business with this customer.

Share-based
      Compensation

We have
share-based compensation plans covering certain employees, including officers
and directors.  We account for share-based compensation utilizing the
fair value recognition provisions of current accounting standards for
share-based payments.  We currently are utilizing restricted share
units and nonstatutory stock options.  Issuances of our stock upon
share option exercise or restricted share unit vesting are made from treasury
stock.  Our restricted share unit awards include both graded-vesting
and cliff-vesting awards and therefore vest in increments during the requisite
service period or at the end of the requisite service period as appropriate for
each type of vesting.  We recognize compensation expense over the
requisite service period for the entire award.

Impairment
      of Long-Lived Assets and Assets Held for
Sale

We
continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in
circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

In
December 2007, partly in response to changing market conditions, we entered into
a plan to sell approximately 700 tractors and 2,500 trailers within our JBT
segment.  Accordingly, we discontinued recording depreciation expense
on this revenue equipment effective January 1, 2008.  We reclassified
the net book value from net property and equipment to assets held for sale in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2007, we recorded a
pretax charge of $8.4 million to reduce the carrying value of the revenue
equipment to estimated fair value, less cost to sell.  Based on our
quarterly assessment to evaluate the carrying value of our assets held for sale,
we determined that a decline in the fair value of certain tractors held for sale
had occurred and accordingly recognized an impairment charge of $0.8 million in
September 2008.

In
December 2008, we entered into a plan to sell approximately 1,100 trailers
within our JBT segment.  We reclassified the net book value from net
property and equipment to assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and discontinued recording depreciation expense for these assets held for
sale.  We recorded a pretax charge of $3.1 million to reduce the
carrying value of these assets to estimated fair value, less cost to
sell.

In June
2009, we entered into a plan to sell approximately 700 tractors within our JBI
and DCS segments.  We reclassified the net book value from net
property and equipment to assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and discontinued recording depreciation expense for these assets held for
sale.  We recorded a pretax charge of $10.3 million to reduce the
carrying value of these assets to estimated fair value, less cost to
sell.


All
impairment charges are included in “general and administrative expenses, net of
asset dispositions” in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are reflected
in our applicable business segments’ final results.

Claims
      Accruals

We
purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee
injuries (workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and cargo
claims.  Most of our insurance arrangements include a level of
self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but provide an
umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are
completely insured.  Our policies also include a contractual premium
adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months
from each policy period inception.  This contractual adjustment factor
is used to convert the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves
us of any further liability on those claims.  Our estimated accrual of
ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors as part of the
liability we recognize when the accidents occur.

The
amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement
dates and policy expiration dates.  During 2007, we were self-insured
for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury, property damage and workers’
compensation.  For 2008 and 2009, we were self-insured for $500,000
per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and $1 million for
workers’ compensation.

Our
claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at
the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the
claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as
legal, economic and regulatory factors.  Our safety and claims
personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to
continually update the estimated cost of each claim.  The ultimate
cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the
nature, timing and extent of damages claimed becomes
available.  Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current
claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability,
including incurred-but-not-reported claims.  This process involves the
use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and
includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned
above.  In doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims
growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for
incurred-but-not-reported claims.  We do not discount our estimated
losses.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had an accrual of
approximately $19 million and $18 million, respectively, for estimated net
claims.  In addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits
and monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a prepaid
insurance asset of approximately $32 million and $50 million, respectively,
which represented prefunded claims and premiums.  We are also
substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased
revenue equipment.

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a
Codification of FASB Accounting Standards and the Hierarchy of GAAP, which
establishes the Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP
recognized by the FASB.  SEC rules and interpretive releases are also
sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.  The Codification
became effective for us beginning July 1, 2009.  The Codification is
not intended to change or alter existing GAAP and accordingly, it did not impact
our results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.  Historical GAAP references in this annual report have been
adjusted to reflect authoritative guidance included in the
Codification.

In May
2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to subsequent events, which
became effective for us during the second quarter of 2009.  This
guidance sets forth the circumstances and the period after the balance sheet
date for which an entity should evaluate events for recognition or disclosure in
its financial statements.  In addition, the guidance identifies the
disclosures that an entity should make about such events.  We have
evaluated subsequent events from December 31, 2009 through February 26, 2010,
when the financial statements were issued, in accordance with this
guidance.  Adoption did not have an effect on our financial
results.


We
adopted the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective January 1,
2009.  Adoption of this guidance increased our disclosures regarding
fair value instruments, but did not have an effect on our operating income or
net earnings.  See Note 10, Fair Value Measurements, for more
description.

- - $100.0.

Revolving Lines of Credit

At
December 31, 2009, we were authorized to borrow up to $350 million under a
revolving line of credit, which expires March 29, 2012.  The
applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate
or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on
the level of borrowings and our credit rating.  At December 31, 2009,
we had $165.0 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 0.74% under
this agreement.

Effective
June 29, 2009, we terminated a $75 million accounts receivable securitization
facility.  Concurrent with this termination, we dissolved a wholly
owned subsidiary, JBH Receivables LLC, which was formed in July 2006 as a
bankruptcy remote entity associated with the accounts receivable securitization
facility.

Senior
Notes

In March
2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31% Senior notes (2011 Notes), which mature
March 29, 2011, to various purchasers through a private-placement offering
pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated March 15, 2007.  The
proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases
and for general working capital purposes.  The 2011 Notes were issued
at par value.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in March and
September of each year.

In July
2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08% Senior notes (2014 Notes), which mature July
26, 2014, to various purchasers through a private-placement offering pursuant to
our note purchase agreement dated July 15, 2007.  Proceeds from these notes
were used to purchase shares of our common stock, pay down existing debt on our
revolving-credit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue
equipment.  Principal payments in the amount of $50.0 million are due
July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder due upon
maturity.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in January and July
of each year.

Term
Loan

Our $100
million term loan facility, which was arranged in connection with our purchase
of used, dry-van trailers, matured September 29,
2009.    The balance due at maturity of $61.5 million was
paid during September 2009 reducing the balance to zero.  Concurrent
with the loan and credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement that expired when the related term loan matured.

Our
revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain
covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all covenants
and financial ratios at December 31, 2009.


4.

Capital
      Stock

We have
one class of preferred stock and one class of common stock.  We had no
outstanding shares of preferred stock at December 31, 2009 or
2008.  Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive
dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to one
vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders.  At December 31, 2009, we had 7.1 million shares of
common stock to be issued upon the exercise or vesting of equity awards and 11.6
million shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to share-based payment
plans.

During
calendar year 2007, we purchased approximately $603 million of our common stock
in accordance with plans authorized by our Board.  All plans have been
completed and there were no stock purchases during calendar years 2008 and
2009.

5.

Share-based
      Compensation

We
maintain a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that provides various
share-based financial methods to compensate our key employees with shares of our
common stock or common stock equivalents. Under the Plan, as amended, we have,
from time to time, utilized restricted share unit awards, restricted options and
nonstatutory stock options to compensate our employees and directors. We
currently are utilizing restricted share units and nonstatutory stock
options.

Our
restricted share units have various vesting schedules ranging from three to ten
years when awarded.  These restricted share units do not contain
rights to vote or receive dividends until the vesting date.  Unvested
restricted share units are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason
other than death, disability or special circumstances as determined by the
Compensation Committee.  Restricted share units are valued based on
the fair value of the award on the grant date, adjusted for dividend estimates
based on grant date dividend rates.

Our
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the purchase of
our common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
grant date as awarded by the Compensation Committee. These options generally
vest over a 10-year period and are forfeited immediately if the employee
terminates for any reason other than death, disability or retirement after age
55.  An employee is allowed to surrender shares of common stock that
the employee has owned for at least six months in full or partial payment of the
option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy tax withholding
obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  We did not grant
any stock options during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007.

We
account for our restricted share units and stock options in accordance with
current accounting standards for share-based payments.  These
standards require the cost of all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial
Statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards.  This
cost is recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award.  Share-based compensation expense
is recorded in salaries, wages and employee benefits in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings, along with other compensation expenses to
employees.  The following table summarizes the components of our
share-based compensation program expense (in thousands):

We
recognized a valuation allowance at December 31, 2009, on a $6.3 million
long-term capital loss carry-forward related to the Transplace
transaction.  See Note 12, Affiliated Company, for more information on
this transaction.  We believe that our history of profitability and
taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and our utilization of
tax planning sufficiently support the carrying amount of the remaining deferred
tax assets, net of valuation allowances.

Guidance
on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes recognition and
measurement criteria and requires that we assess whether the benefits of our tax
positions taken are more likely than not of being sustained under tax
audits.  We adopted the provisions of this guidance effective January 1,
2007.  As a result of this adoption, we recognized a reduction to beginning
retained earnings of $7.5 million, as of January 1, 2007.  For the year
ended December 31, 2009, we have made adjustments to the balance of unrecognized
tax benefits that is a component of other long-term liabilities on our

At

respectively, in gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of these amounts,
$12.3 million and $9.7 million represents the amount of unrecognized
tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate in
2009 and 2008, respectively.  Interest and penalties related to income
taxes are classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The amount of accrued interest and penalties during the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1.0 million, $1.5 million, and $6.4
million, respectively.  Future changes to unrecognized tax benefits
will be recognized as income tax expense and interest expense, as
appropriate.  The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $3.0 million and
$3.5 million, respectively.

Tax years
2006 and forward remain subject to examination by federal tax jurisdictions,
while tax years 1999 and forward remain open for state
jurisdictions.

7.

Employee
      Benefit Plans

We
maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a
401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to
participate.  We match a specified percentage of employee
contributions, subject to certain limitations.  For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our matching contributions to the plan were
$2.9 million, $8.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively.  Effective
March 1, 2009, we decreased our company match percentage from 50% to 0% for
participants who are salaried employees exempt from overtime compensation and
from 50% to 25% for all other participants.

We have a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer
a portion of their compensation.  Participants can elect to defer up
to a maximum of 50% of their base salary as well as up to 85% of their bonus for
the year.  The compensation deferred under this plan is credited with
earnings or losses on investments elected by plan participants.  Each
participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however,
these amounts are subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed
to the employee.  A participant may elect to receive deferred amounts
in one payment or, if the balance is greater than $25,000, in quarterly
installments payable over a period of 3, 5, 10 or 15 years upon reaching age 55,
having 15 years of service or becoming disabled.  Our total liability
under this plan was $9.4 million as of December 31, 2009, and $7.6 million as of
December 31, 2008.  These amounts are included in other long-term
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Participant
withholdings are held by a trustee and invested in equity securities as directed
by participants.  These investments are classified as trading
securities and recorded at fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains
and losses are recognized currently in earnings.  The investments are
included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $9.4
million as of December 31, 2009, and $7.6 million as of December 31,
2008.

8.

Derivative
      and Financial Instruments

Interest
rate swap

In
September 2006, we entered into an agreement to swap the variable rate on our
$100 million term loan and credit facility for a fixed 5.85% interest
rate.  The swap expired September 29, 2009, when the related term loan
was due. The derivative was designated as a hedge of the variability of cash
flows to be paid related to the term loan and met the criteria of a cash flow
hedge.  Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the derivative were
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into
earnings as the underlying hedged item affected earnings to the extent the
derivative was effective in offsetting gains and losses of changes in the fair
value of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of gains and losses, if any,
was recorded in current earnings through interest expense.  The fair
value of the swap was zero at December 31, 2009, and $1.9 million at December
31, 2008, and was recorded in other accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.


Fair

The
carrying values and estimated fair values, based on their net present value, of
our long-term debt at December 31, 2009, were as follows (in

Fair
      Value Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of accounting standards related to
fair value measurements.  The standards, among other things, define
fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosure
about such fair value measurements.  Assets and liabilities measured
at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques provided
for in the standards.  The three valuation techniques are as
follows:

Market
      Approach

Prices
      and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
      identical or comparable assets and
liabilities

Income
      Approach

Techniques
      to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market
      expectations (including present value techniques and option-pricing
      models)

Cost
      Approach

Amount
      that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an
      asset (often referred to as replacement
cost)

The
standards clarify that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that
would be received to sell an asset, based on the highest and best use of the
asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants.  As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that
should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability.  As a basis for evaluating such
assumptions, the standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:


Level

Quoted
      prices in active markets for identified assets or
    liabilities

Level

Inputs,
      other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either
      directly or indirectly

Level

Unobservable
      inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
      reporting entity to develop its own assumptions about what market
      participants would use in pricing the asset or
  liability

The
following are assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2009:

investments are classified in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
and measured on a recurring basis.  Assets held for sale are measured

measurements increased our disclosures regarding such measurements and did not
have an effect on our operating income or net earnings.

Commitments
      and Contingencies

As of
December 31, 2009, we had approximately $15.6 million of obligations remaining
under operating lease arrangements related to terminal facilities.

Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or
remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2009, are
approximately $15.6 million, with payment streams as follows (in thousands):
2010 - $6,390; 2011 - $4,507; 2012 - $2,587; 2013 - $986; 2014 - $443 and 2015
and thereafter - $694.

Total
rent expense was $19.4 million in 2009, $19.6 million in 2008, and $29.2 million
in 2007.

At
December 31, 2009, we had outstanding commitments to acquire approximately $132
million of revenue equipment and facilities in 2010.  This amount is
net of approximately $30 million of expected sales proceeds from equipment
dispositions, based on trade-in values agreed to with third
parties.

During
2009, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our
performance under certain operating lease commitments and self-insurance
arrangements.  If we default on our commitments under the lease
agreements or other arrangements, we are required to perform under these
guarantees.  The undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make
future payments in the event of defaults is approximately $10.5
million.

We are a
defendant in certain class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs are
current and former California-based drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages,
failure to provide meal and rest periods, and other items.  Further
proceedings have been stayed in these matters pending the California Supreme
Court’s decision in a case unrelated to ours involving similar
issues.  We cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss
or range of loss, if any, that may arise from these lawsuits.

We are
involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal
conduct of business.  Based on the present knowledge of the facts and,
in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of
these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, our results of operations or our
liquidity.

a 37% equity interest in a logistics joint venture called Transplace, Inc.
(TPI).  We routinely entered into transactions with TPI regarding the
movement of freight.  We earned transportation revenues and incurred
purchase transportation expenses from TPI.  We advanced $7.7 million
to TPI in the form of a note receivable during 2005, and in January 2009 the due
date on this note was extended to August 2011.  The note carried an
interest rate of 6.0%.  In 2006, we reduced the remainder of our
original investment in the joint venture to zero as a result of our equity in
loss of TPI.  In accordance with current accounting standards, we have
reduced the balance of the note receivable by the amount of our equity in losses
of TPI.


In
December 2009, all of the assets and operations of TPI were sold to an unrelated
third party.  Proceeds from the sale were used to repay the note
holders.  We received $5.6 million in December as repayment of our
outstanding note.  These transactions generated a $3.3 million pretax
gain that was recorded in the equity in operations of affiliated company in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Revenues
earned from TPI for providing transportation services were $13.7 million, $22.5
million and $22.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Accounts receivable from TPI, which are included in our
trade accounts receivable, were $1.8 million and $3.4 million at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.  Net note receivable from TPI, which is
included in other assets, was $0 and $2.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Segment
      Information

We have
four reportable business segments - Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS), Truck (JBT), and Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) - which are
based primarily on the services each segment provides.  The JBI
segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at least some portion
of the movement and also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by
JBI equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to
direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal operations.  DCS segment
business typically includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers
assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS
operations usually include formal, written longer-term agreements or contracts
that govern services performed and applicable rates.  JBT business
includes full-load dry-van freight that is typically transported utilizing
company-owned or company-controlled revenue equipment.  This freight
is typically transported over roads and highways and does not move by
rail.  ICS provides non-asset and asset-light transportation solutions
to customers through relationships with third-party carriers and integration
with JBHT-owned equipment.  ICS services include flatbed, refrigerated
and LTL, as well as a variety of dry-van and intermodal
solutions.  All transactions between reporting segments are eliminated
in consolidation.

Our
customers are geographically dispersed across the United States.  One
customer accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 12% of consolidated operating
revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  A summary of certain
segment information as of December 31 is presented below (in
