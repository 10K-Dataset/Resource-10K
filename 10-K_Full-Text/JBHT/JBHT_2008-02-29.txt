FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report, including documents which are incorporated by
reference, and other documents which we file periodically with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), contains statements that may be considered to be
“forward-looking statements.”  Such
statements relate to our predictions concerning future events or operations and
are within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.   Forward-looking statements are
inherently uncertain, subject to risks, and should be viewed with caution.  These statements are based on our belief or
interpretation of information currently available.  Stockholders and prospective investors are
cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from the
forward-looking statements as a result of many factors.  Some of the factors and events that are not
within our control and that could have a material impact on future operating
results include:  general economic and
business conditions, competition and competitive rate fluctuations, cost and
availability of diesel fuel, ability to attract and retain qualified drivers, a
loss of one or more major customers, interference with or termination of our
relationships with certain railroads, insurance costs and availability, claims
expense, retention of key employees, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war,
adverse weather conditions, new or different environmental or other laws and
regulations, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the
value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to
perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade-in
values.  Current and future changes in fuel
prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly earnings.

You should understand that many important factors, in
addition to those listed above, could impact us financially.  Our operating results may fluctuate as a
result of these and other risk factors or events as described in our filings
with the SEC.  Some important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements are described under “Risk Factors”
in Item 1A.  We assume no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement to the extent we become aware that it will
not be achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

We are one of the largest surface transportation companies in
North America.  J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. is a publicly held holding company that, together with our
wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies, provides a wide range of
transportation services to a diverse group of customers throughout the continental
United States, Canada and Mexico.  Unless
otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B.
Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We were incorporated in Arkansas on August 10,
1961, and have been a publicly held company since our initial public offering
in 1983.  Our service offerings include
transportation of full-load freight, which we directly transport in multimodal
arrangements utilizing our company-owned revenue equipment and company drivers,
independent contractors, or third parties. 
This full-load freight may be transported entirely by truck over roads
and highways, or may be moved, in part, by rail.  We have arrangements with most of the major
North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers and
trailers.  We also provide customized
freight movement, revenue equipment, labor and systems services that are
tailored to meet individual customers’ requirements and typically involve
long-term contracts.  These arrangements
are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple
pickups and drops, local and home deliveries, freight handling, specialized
equipment and network design.  We also
provide integrated capacity and comprehensive transportation services and solutions
by utilizing a network of thousands of reliable third-party carriers.  While these unrelated outside carriers at
times supplement our dry van, full-load operations, they also provide flatbed,
refrigerated, less-than-truckload and other specialized equipment, drivers and
services.  In addition, we have a 37%
ownership interest in a global transportation logistics company, Transplace, Inc.
(TPI).  TPI is co-owned by five large
transportation companies and provides supplemental sales, management and freight-movement
services through arrangements with a large number of common carriers.


Our business operations are primarily organized through four
distinct, but complementary, business segments. 
These segments include intermodal (JBI), dedicated contract services
(DCS), full-load dry-van (JBT) and integrated capacity solutions (ICS).  Our business is somewhat seasonal with
slightly higher freight volumes typically experienced during the months of August through
early November.  Our DCS segment is
subject to less seasonal variation than our other segments.  For the calendar year ended December 31,
2007, our consolidated revenue totaled $3.5 billion, after the elimination of
inter-segment business.  Of the total,
$1.7 billion, or 47%, was generated by our JBI business segment.  Our DCS segment represented $937 million, or
27%, of total revenue.  Our JBT segment
generated $842 million, or 24%, and our ICS segment generated $92 million, or
2%.

Additional general information about us is available from our
Internet website at

www.jbhunt.com

.  We make a number of reports and other
information available free of charge on our website, including our annual
report on Form 10-K, our proxy statement and our earnings releases.  Our website also contains corporate
governance guidelines, our code of ethics, our whistleblower policy, committee
charters for our Board of Directors and other corporate policies.

OUR MISSION AND STRATEGY

We forge long-term
partnerships with key customers that include supply-chain management as an
integral part of their strategy.  Working
in concert, we drive out cost, add value and function as an extension of our
customers’ enterprise.  We believe that
our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and
returns to stockholders.

RECENT FOCUS

During the past several
years, we have taken significant steps to re-establish a primary focus on the
profitability of our business segments. 
In each segment we have implemented capacity-management decision-making
processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they
will generate more profit.  We
continually focus on replacing less-profitable freight with higher-margin
freight and lanes.  Selective pricing
actions and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have
also been areas of major focus.  Recent
examples of actions taken to redeploy our assets include: 1) a decision to sell
certain revenue equipment within our JBT business segment; 2) expanding the
number of third-party carriers that provide us with transportation services,
and 3) growing our ICS business with new and existing customers.  Each of these are discussed in more detail in
the operating segments’ sections.

Increasingly, our customers are seeking energy-efficient
transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhouse-gas emissions.  Our intermodal service addresses both
demands.  We are also beginning to
customize dedicated solutions aimed at minimizing transportation-related carbon
emissions.  Efforts to improve fleet fuel
efficiency are ongoing, and we are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
SmartWay

SM

Transport Partner.

In addition, fundamental
changes in shipper supply-chain transportation logistics have resulted in the
conversion of freight from traditional random truckload to intermodal and
dedicated operations.  We continue to
ingrain safety into our corporate culture and conduct all of our operations as
safely as possible.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Segment
information is also included in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

JBI Segment

The
transportation service offerings of our JBI segment utilize arrangements with
most major North American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions
for our customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and
Mexico.  Our JBI segment began operations
in 1989 with a unique


partnership with the former Santa Fe Railway
(now the BNSF Railway Company), a watershed event in the industry and the first
agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing
environment.  Essentially, JBI draws on
the intermodal (also known as “container on flatcar”) services of rail carriers
for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups
and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at the origin and destination rail
terminal locations. We may directly provide the drayage service at either the
origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our company-owned tractors, or we may
purchase these services from third parties. 
JBI provides seamless coordination of the rail and over-the-road
transport movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for the
complete door-to-door service.

Our
intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to more than 738,000 in
2007.  JBI operates 34,019
company-controlled containers system wide. 
The entire fleet comprises 53-foot, high-cube containers and is designed
to take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior ride
quality.  JBI also manages a fleet of
1,795 company-owned tractors and 2,232 company drivers in support of intermodal
operations.  At December 31, 2007,
the total JBI employee count was 2,494. 
Revenue for the JBI segment in calendar year 2007 was $1.65 billion,
compared with $1.43 billion in 2006.  As
previously announced, an arbitration process with the BNSF Railway Company
(BNI) was concluded during the third quarter 2005.  In accordance with the settlement terms, we
paid BNI $25.8 million.  In addition,
this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expenses
effective October 1, 2005.  Normal
commercial business activity continued with BNI during the approximate 15-month
arbitration process, and normal business operations have continued since the
final settlement.

DCS Segment

Since 1992, we have
offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option.  Our DCS segment operations specialize in the
design, development and execution of customer-specific fleet solutions.  Capitalizing on advanced systems and
technologies, DCS offers transportation engineering solutions that support
private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet creation and transportation system
augmentation.  DCS operations typically
provide customized services that are governed by long-term contracts and
currently include dry-van, flatbed, temperature-controlled, dump trailers and
local inner-city operations.

DCS
operations focus on delivering recognizable customer value through
best-in-class service, cost control and guaranteed dedicated capacity.  We utilize a proprietary methodology known as
Customer Value Delivery

®

(CVD) to create, measure and communicate
value generated for each customer.  DCS
leverages the JBHT freight network to reposition equipment near outbound
domiciles, thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost.  We also frequently find synergy in shared
resources with the JBT and JBI segments, including terminals, drivers, maintenance
shops, bulk fuel locations and trailer pools providing further economies of
scale.  DCS revenue for calendar year
2007 was $937 million, compared with $915 million in 2006.  In early 2004, DCS began utilizing
independent contractors (ICs) and at December 31, 2007, we had 100 ICs
operating in this segment.  At December 31,
2007, our segment operated 4,941 company-controlled and 92 customer-owned
trucks and employed 6,041 people, 5,262 of whom were drivers.

JBT Segment

Our
primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include
full-load, dry-van freight, which is predominantly transported utilizing
company-controlled tractors operating over roads and highways.  We pick up our freight at the dock or
specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the
location of the consignee.  Our loads are
transported by our company-owned tractors and employee drivers or by ICs who
agree to transport freight in our trailers. 
This type of freight movement typically results in our billing the
customer for all applicable freight charges and, in turn, paying the third
party for their portion of the transportation services provided.  This type of service usually results in our
recognition of revenue for the entire billing and the payment to the third
party being classified as purchased transportation expense.


We operate under the
approval of certain Canadian authorities, allowing us to transport freight to
and from all points in the continental United States to Quebec, British
Columbia and Ontario.  We have
authorization to operate directly in substantially all the Canadian provinces,
but to date we have served limited points in Canada, primarily through
interchange operations with Canadian motor carriers.  In late 2000, we began utilizing ICs in the
JBT segment and at December 31, 2007, we had 978 ICs operating in the JBT
segment, some of whom were leasing company-owned tractors.  JBT revenue for calendar year 2007 was $842
million, compared with $966 million in 2006. 
At December 31, 2007, the JBT segment operated 3,572 company-owned
tractors and employed 4,517 people, 3,635 of whom were drivers.  A portion of our JBT segment nondriver
employees provide freight solicitation, order entry and other operational
support services to our other two segments. 
We record inter-segment credits and charges to properly reflect these
inter-segment support services.

In December 2007, we entered into a plan to reduce the size of our
JBT fleet and sell approximately 700 tractors and 2,500 trailers.  This plan is consistent with our strategy to
move our economic model from that of a primarily asset-based truckload carrier
to an asset-light transportation company and our focus for growth and investment
in segments that provide the desired margins. 
We expect to sell this equipment during calendar year 2008.  As a result of the plan, we recorded a pretax
charge of $8.4 million in December 2007 to reduce the carrying value of
the revenue equipment to estimated fair value, less costs to sell.

ICS Segment

ICS
provides non-asset and asset-light transportation solutions to customers
through relationships with third-party carriers and integration with JBHT owned
equipment.  This type of freight movement
typically results in our billing the customer for all applicable freight
charges and, in turn, paying the third party for their portion of the
transportation services provided.  This
type of service usually results in our recognition of revenue for the entire
billing and the payment to the third party being classified as purchased
transportation expense.  ICS services
include flatbed, refrigerated and less-than-truckload (LTL), as well as a
variety of dry van and intermodal solutions. 
ICS revenue for calendar year 2007 was $92 million, compared with $42
million in 2006.  At December 31,
2007, the ICS segment employed approximately 120 people.

Prior
to 2007, ICS financial results were reported as part of the JBT segment.  Beginning January 1, 2007, we began
reporting ICS results separately.  Prior
period segment information has been reclassified to reflect this change.

Logistics Business and Affiliated
Company

Effective July 1,
2000, we contributed an existing logistics segment business to a newly formed
company, Transplace, Inc. (TPI). 
TPI is a non-asset-based third-party logistics provider offering a blend
of logistics technology and transportation management services.  Our share of TPI’s financial results is
included on a one-line, nonoperating item included on our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings titled “equity in loss of affiliated company.”

Operations
in Mexico

We have
provided transportation services to and from Mexico since 1989.  These services typically involve equipment
interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers.  We provide transportation services to and
from Mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of Mexican
carriers.

Marketing and Operations

We transport, or arrange
for the transportation of, a wide range of freight, including forest and paper
products, building materials, general merchandise, food and beverages,
chemicals and automotive parts.  Our
customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of Fortune 500
companies.  Our ability to offer multiple
services, utilizing our four business segments and a full complement of
logistics services through third parties, represents a competitive
advantage.  We provide a broad range of


transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited
number of “core” carriers.  Our largest
customer in 2007 was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for
approximately 12% of our total revenue.

We generally market all of
our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network.  We do have some sales and marketing functions
managed at the business-unit level, particularly for our DCS segment.  In accordance with our typical arrangements,
we bill the customer for all services and we, in turn, pay all third parties
for their portion of transportation services provided.  In recent years, we have re-established a
primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments
and charging a fair price for all services provided.

People

We believe that one of the
factors differentiating us from our competitors is our service-oriented
people.  As of December 31, 2007, we
had 15,795 employees, including 11,129 company drivers, 1,177 mechanics and
3,489 office personnel.  We also had
arrangements with 1,084 ICs to transport freight in our trailing
equipment.  None of our employees are
represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.

While we experienced
improvements in 2007 relative to the past few years, our industry has
periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified
truck drivers.  It is also common for the
driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100%.  It has been our practice to compensate our
drivers at an above-average level in order to attract a higher caliber of
experience and minimize turnover.  While
we have not, to date, experienced significant operational disruptions due to
driver shortages, we expect the costs to recruit, train and retain company
drivers and ICs will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.

Revenue Equipment

As of December 31,
2007, our company-owned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 10,308 units.  In addition, we had 1,084 ICs, who operate
their own tractors, but transport freight in our trailing equipment.  We operate with standardized tractors in as
many fleets as possible, particularly in our JBI and JBT fleets.  Based on our customers’ preferences and the
actual business application, our DCS fleet is more diversified.  We believe operating with relatively newer
revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts quality drivers
and lowers maintenance expense.  At December 31,
2007, the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 3.0 years, our trailers
averaged 6.4 years of age and our containers averaged 5.7 years.  We perform routine servicing and preventive
maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities.

Our JBI segment utilizes
high-cube containers, which can be separated from the chassis and
double-stacked on rail cars.  We are
currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning
our chassis fleet.  The composition of
our DCS trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may
include dry-vans, flatbeds, temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, straight
trucks and dump trailers.  We typically
operate newer revenue equipment in our JBT segment to minimize downtime and
maximize utilization.  We primarily
utilize third-party carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ICS
segment; however, certain loads will utilize third-party carriers’ tractors
powering our trailing equipment.

In December 2007, we initiated a plan to sell certain revenue equipment in our JBT segment.  This plan is an effort to continue moving our current economic model from that of a primarily asset-based truckload carrier of the past to an asset-light transportation company, while reducing the JBT fleet until acceptable margins and returns on invested capital are achieved.  Terms of the plan include approximately 700 tractors and 2,500 trailers to be sold during calendar year 2008.

Effective with model-year
2007 tractors, the EPA mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured
heavy-duty tractor engines.  The 2007
EPA-compliant engines require more costly ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD)
fuel.  Current market information and our
experience to date indicates that ULSD fuel costs approximately $0.02 to $0.05
more per gallon.  In 2006, we began
testing the model-year 2007


engines in a group of our tractors. 
To date, we have seen a slight reduction in miles per gallon due to
using ULSD fuel and these new 2007 EPA-compliant engines, and an increase in
operating costs.  Further, the
acquisition costs of these new engines has increased by approximately 10%.  A new set of more stringent emissions
standards will become effective for newly-manufactured tractor engines in January 2010.

Competition and the Industry

The market in which we
compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands
of carriers, many of which are very small. 
While we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis,
only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across
the country.  We compete with other
freight transportation carriers primarily in terms of on-time pickup and
delivery service, availability of drivers, and revenue equipment and price.

Regulation

Our operations as a
for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA), and certain business is also subject to state rules and
regulations.  The DOT periodically
conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety
requirements, and we report certain accident and other information to the
DOT.  Our operations into and out of
Canada and Mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries.

In July 2007,
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated certain provisions contained in the
hours-of-service (HOS) regulations, issued by the FMCSA.  The 11-hour-limit rule, which restricts
drivers to 11 hours of driving time within a 14-hour period from the start of
the workday, and the 34-hour-restart rule, which allows drivers to restart
their weekly on-duty calculations after 34 consecutive hours off duty, were
vacated by the court’s decision.  In September 2007,
subsequent to petitions and motions by various groups, the court granted a
90-day delay in the effective date of its ruling.  In December 2007, the FMCSA temporarily
reinstated the vacated provisions until it gathers public comment and safety
analysis information before issuing a final ruling.  The public comment period extends until March 17,
2008.  There has been no lapse in these rules since
they were issued by the FMCSA in 2005. 
We continue to monitor the actions of the FMCSA.

ITEM 1A

.   RISK FACTORS

In
addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in this Form 10-K,
and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk
factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business.  Our business, financial condition or
financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these
risks.  Also note that additional risks
not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our
business or financial results.

Our business is subject to general economic and business factors that
are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse
effect

on our results of operations.

Our business is dependent upon a number
of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our
operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include significant increases
or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry,
interest rates, fuel taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums,
self-insurance levels, interference with, or termination of, our relationships
with certain railroads, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse
weather conditions, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in
the value of used equipment, surpluses in the market for used equipment, and
difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent
contractors.

We are also affected by recessionary
economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in
market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing, where we have
a


significant
concentration of customers.  Economic
conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to
increase our reserve for bad-debt losses. 
In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal
factors.  Customers tend to reduce
shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to
be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes
higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.

We operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry.  Numerous factors could impair our ability to
maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and
private fleets.

Some of these factors include:

·

We compete with many other
transportation carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with
less-than-truckload carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and
greater capital resources than we do.

·

Some of our competitors
periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during
times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to
maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins.

·

Many customers reduce the
number of carriers they use by selecting so-called “core carriers” as approved
transportation service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.

·

Many customers periodically
accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process
may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to
competitors.

·

Certain of our customers
that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to
expand their operations.

·

Consolidation in the
transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial
resources and other competitive advantages related to their size.

·

Advances in technology
require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not
be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these
investments.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major
customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

For the calendar year ended December 31,
2007, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 38%
of our revenue.  Our largest customer,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 12% of our total
revenue in 2007.  Our JBT and JBI
segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers.  While our DCS segment business may involve a
written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there
is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our
services or that they will continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our services
by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.

We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.

Our JBI business segment utilizes
railroads in the performance of its transportation services.  The majority of these services are provided
pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads.  While we have agreements with various Class I
railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern railways. 
The inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results.  We also utilize the services of a number of
third-party dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and
destination pickups and deliveries.  In
addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United


States
through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts.  Work stoppages or other disruptions at
any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our ICS business segment utilizes
third-party carriers.  Aside from
periodic use of our trailing equipment to satisfy certain loads, we do not own
the revenue equipment nor do we employ the drivers delivering the loads.  The inability to obtain reliable third-party
carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and
business growth.

Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our
profitability and ability to grow.

Periodically, the trucking industry
experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified
drivers, including ICs.  If we are unable
to continue attracting an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough
ICs, we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation
package or let revenue equipment sit idle, which could adversely affect our
growth and profitability.

Ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our
earnings.

Our future insurance and claims expenses
might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings.  During 2005, we self-insured a portion of our
claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage and
health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for auto accidents and $1
million for workers’ compensation. 
During 2006 and 2007, the self-insured portion of our claims exposure
for all claims was $500,000 per occurrence. 
If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured
increases, our operating results could be adversely affected.  The self-insured portion of our claims will
be $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and $1
million per occurrence for workers’ compensation during 2008.  We purchase insurance coverage for the
amounts above which we are self-insured. 
If these expenses increase, and we are unable to offset the increase
with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely
affected.

Our operations are subject
to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could
result in substantial fines or penalties.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations
dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage
tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water.  We operate in industrial areas, where truck
terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or
other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel
spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal, among
others.  We also maintain bulk fuel
storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If we are involved in a spill or other
accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation
of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results.  If
we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be
subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.

We operate in a regulated
industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or
liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over
our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in
motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial
reporting.  We are audited periodically
by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety,
hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the
DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.

We
continue to monitor actions taken by the FMCSA. 
Significant changes in hours-of-service and other motor carrier safety
regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver
productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping
equipment.


Effective with model-year
2007 tractors, the EPA mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured
heavy-duty tractor engines.  The 2007
EPA-compliant engines require more costly ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel.  Further, the acquisition costs of these new
engines has increased by approximately 10%. 
A new set of more stringent emissions standards will become effective
for newly-manufactured tractor engines in January 2010.  While it is too early to assess the impact of
the new standards, our fuel costs, operating costs and acquisition costs could
be impacted.

Rapid changes in fuel
costs could impact our periodic financial results.

During the past several years, fuel cost per gallon has
varied significantly.  We have a fuel
surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which
has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs.  Most of these programs automatically adjust
weekly depending on the cost of fuel. 
However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel
cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers.  In addition, we incur additional costs when
fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled
during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be
billed to customers.  Rapid increases in
fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our
operations or future profitability.  As
of December 31, 2007, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce
our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.

.  
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION

The following discussion of our results of operations and financial
condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes in Item 8.  This discussion
contains forward-looking statements. 
Please see “Forward-looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a
discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these
statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of our financial statements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our Consolidated
Financial Statements and accompanying notes. 
Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by
these estimates.  We evaluate these
estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation
with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular
circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual
results may differ significantly from our estimates.  Any effects on our business, financial
position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates
are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to
the revision become known.  We consider
our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to
make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial
statements and include the following:

Workers’ Compensation and Accident Costs

We purchase insurance
coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries (workers’
compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and cargo claims.  Most of our insurance arrangements include a
level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but
provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs
that are completely insured.  Our
policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to
incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period
inception.  This contractual adjustment
factor is used to convert the self-insured losses to fully insured losses and
relieves us of any further liability on those claims.  Our estimated accrual of ultimate losses
includes these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the
accidents occur.

The amounts of
self-insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and
policy expiration dates.  During 2005, we
were self-insured for $2 million per occurrence for personal injury and
property damage and $1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation
claims.   During 2006 and 2007, we were
self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury, property damage
and workers’ compensation.  For 2008, we
are self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property
damage and $1 million for workers’ compensation claims.


Our claims accrual policy
for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the
incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and
analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal,
economic and regulatory factors.  Our
safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the
insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each
claim.  The ultimate cost of a claim
develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing and
extent of damages claimed becomes available. 
Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim
information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability.  This process involves the use of
loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes
the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above.  In doing so, the recorded liability considers
future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an
allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. 
We do not discount our estimated losses. 
At December 31, 2007, we had an accrual of approximately $19
million for estimated net claims.  In
addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly
premiums.  At December 31, 2007, we
had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $53 million, which represented
prefunded claims and premiums.  We are
also substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased
revenue equipment.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a significant
number of tractors, trucks, trailers and containers in connection with our
business.  This equipment may be
purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements.  In addition, we may rent revenue equipment
from third parties and various railroads under short-term rental
arrangements.  Revenue equipment which is
purchased is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life down to an estimated salvage or trade-in value.  We periodically review the useful lives and
salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for
impairment.  See Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for
a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment.  We have not identified any impairments to our
remaining assets.

We have an agreement with our
primary tractor supplier for residual or trade-in values for certain new
equipment.  We have utilized these
trade-in values, as well as other operational information, such as anticipated
annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense.  If our tractor supplier were unable to
perform under the terms of our agreement for trade-in values, it could have a
material negative impact on our financial results.  We had no revenue equipment under capital
lease arrangements at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based
on the relative transit time of the freight transported.  Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue
which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in
each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and
delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.

Our trade accounts
receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for
uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and
reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as
any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility.  The adequacy of our allowances and reserves
is reviewed quarterly.

Income Taxes

We
account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method in accordance
with current accounting standards.  Our
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable
income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded
the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings.  Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of
timing differences between when items are recognized in our Consolidated Financial
Statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns.  We assess the likelihood that deferred tax
assets will be recovered from future taxable income.  To the extent we believe recovery is not
probable, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent we establish a
valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our


income
tax provision.  We have not recorded a
valuation allowance at December 31, 2007, as all deferred tax assets are
more likely than not to be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the
impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our
provision for income taxes.  As part of
our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the
benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being
sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position.  For tax positions that are more likely than
not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit
that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial
statements.  Such accruals require us to
make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from
these estimates.  Further, a number of
years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established an
accrual, is audited and resolved.  See
Note 6, Income Taxes, in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for a
discussion of our current tax contingencies.

YEAR IN REVIEW

Highlights of significant events for calendar year
2007 include:

·

Sixth consecutive year of
record revenues.

·

Continued strategy of
transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily asset-based truckload
carrier to an asset-light transportation company.

·

Designated approximately 700
tractors and 2,500 trailers in our JBT segment to sell in calendar year 2008 in
connection with our strategy to reduce the JBT segment fleet size to the
appropriate level, incurring a $8.4 million pretax charge to record the revenue
equipment to estimated fair value, less costs to sell.

·

Completed a Post Appeals
Mediation with the IRS and agreed to a settlement of a sale-and-leaseback
transaction and other uncertain tax positions related to IRS audits for tax
years 1998-2003.  This settlement
resulted in a $49.5 million payment to the IRS.

·

Announced a new business
segment, Integrated Capacity Solutions, consistent with our asset-light
transportation company strategy.

·

Purchased 21.7 million
shares of our common stock totaling $603.4 million in 2007, completing a series
of authorized stock purchase programs totaling $1.1 billion or 44.5 million
shares that commenced in calendar year 2005.

·

Issued $400 million in
senior notes through two issuances maturing in 2011 and 2014, with proceeds
used for stock purchases, revenue equipment purchases, primarily for our JBI
and DCS segments, and other general working capital purposes.

·

Increased our quarterly
dividend to $0.09 per share in January 2007 from $0.08 in 2006, and
announced an additional increase to a $0.10 quarterly dividend effective February 2008.

Our 2007 net earnings of $213.1 million, or $1.55
per diluted share, were down 3% from the $220.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted
share, earned in 2006.  Fuel costs
continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during
2007.  Our 2007 fuel cost per gallon
averaged 6.9% above 2006 levels. 
However, due to our fuel surcharge programs, we were able to recover the
majority of our higher fuel costs.

Freight demand during 2007 was relatively consistent
for our JBI and DCS segments.  Demand for
dry-van truck capacity was softer, particularly during the fourth quarter
2007.  Comparisons of 2007 dry-van
volumes to 2006 were negatively impacted by freight recessions including
lower-than-expected


seasonal
demand during August through November of 2007.  Our JBI segment contributed to our higher
level of profitability in 2007, growing operating income by 31%, while our JBT
and DCS segments experienced a decline in operating income, as compared with
2006, of 62% and 10%, respectively.  In
response to changing market conditions and in continuance of focusing on
growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital, we
increased our JBI tractor and container counts by 14% and 23%, respectively, as
well as increasing our DCS trailer count by 26%.  We reduced our JBT company-owned tractor
fleet by 16%, excluding tractors designated as held for sale.  We were able to affect some of these changes
by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets.

We also continued our focus on capacity management
during 2007.  Capacity management is a
continuous process of reviewing our freight demand on a daily basis and our
contractual relationships to determine which business application and segment
generates the best returns. We also continually analyze our business to ensure
that we are charging a fair price for all services we provide.  Our capacity management actions and changes
in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from
over-the-road truck operations to intermodal and dedicated services.

Our 2007 consolidated
operating ratio (operating expenses divided by total operating revenues) was
89.4%, compared with 88.8% in 2006.  The
current year was the fourth consecutive time that we have achieved an operating
ratio for a full year below 90%.  Our
2007 operating income reflected an $8.4 million pretax charge to write down the
value of certain assets held for sale.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth items in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage
increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year.


2007 Compared With 2006

Consolidated Operating
Revenues

Our total consolidated operating
revenues rose to $3.5 billion in 2007, a 4.9% increase over 2006.  Significantly higher fuel prices resulted in
fuel surcharge (FSC) revenues of $480 million in 2007, compared with $430
million in 2006.  This FSC revenue
impacted our year-to-year comparison.  If
FSC revenues were excluded from both years, the increase of 2007 revenue over 2006
was 3.9%.  This increased level of
revenue, excluding FSC, was primarily a result of increases in load volume and
price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions and ICS
business growth.  A 17.3% and 148.4%
increase in 2007 JBI and ICS load volume, respectively, contributed to our
higher levels of revenue.  The increases
in revenue of our JBI, DCS, and ICS segments were partially offset by decreases
in our JBT segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet, rate declines and
reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in the JBT
segment.

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Our total 2007
consolidated operating expenses increased 5.6% over 2006.  The combination of the 4.9% increase in 2007
revenue over 2006 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in a slight
increase in our operating ratio to 89.4% from 88.8% in 2006.  Rents and purchased transportation costs rose
9.8% in 2007, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads, drayage
companies and third-party carriers servicing ICS.  This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain
trailing equipment off operating leases during 2007.  The total cost of salaries, wages and
employee benefits decreased less than 1% in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to
decreases in total driver pay.  This
reduction in total driver pay was primarily a result of a 27% decrease in the
number of drivers in the JBT segment.

Fuel and fuel taxes
expense increased 3.6% in 2007, primarily due to 6.9% higher fuel cost per
gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  We have fuel surcharge programs in place with
the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue
charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change.  It is not meaningful to compare the amount of
FSC revenue or the change of FSC revenue between reporting periods to fuel and
fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a
significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads,
dray carriers and other third parties. 
These payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.  While we are not always able to recover all
fuel cost increases, partly due to empty miles run and engine-idling time, we
were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs.

The 11.7% increase in
depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing
equipment, including new containers and chassis for our JBI segment, as well as
trailers purchased off operating leases. 
Operating supplies and expenses rose 6.9% in 2007, partly as a result of
higher revenue equipment maintenance, including tractors and trailing
equipment, as well as increased tire costs. 
The 45.1% increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily
related to the $8.4 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down
the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value, less costs to
sell.  This increase was also due to
losses on asset sales of $0.4 million in 2007 compared with gains on asset
sales of $2.9 million in 2006.

Our effective income tax
rate was 34.4% in 2007 and 37.9% in 2006. 
The decrease in our effective tax rate compared with the prior-year rate
is primarily the result of our settlement on a proposed Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) adjustment, which resulted in a $12.1 million decrease of income tax
expense in the second quarter 2007.  See
Note 6, Income Taxes, for further information regarding this settlement.  We expect our effective income tax rate to
approximate 39% for calendar year 2008. The “equity in loss of affiliated
company” item on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of
the operating results of TPI.


Segments

We
operated four business segments during calendar year 2007.  The operation of each of these businesses is
described in our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following tables summarize financial and
operating data by segment.

Operating Revenue by Segment

Includes company-owned and independent contractor
tractors for JBI and JBT segments, and also includes customer-owned trucks for
the DCS segment

(2)   Reflects average use of corporatewide

(3)   Using weighted workdays

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 15.6% to
$1.65 billion in 2007, from $1.43 billion in 2006.  A significant portion of this revenue growth
was driven by a 17.3% increase in load volume. 
The remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of
changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue.  The increase was partially offset by a
decrease in revenue per load due to a decrease in the average length of haul of
3.2% from 2006.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose
to $239 million in 2007, from $182 million in 2006.  While increased volumes contributed to higher
operating margins, we were able to reduce the number of empty truck miles in
our pickup and delivery operations, increase our driver productivity and
significantly reduce our reliance on third-party equipment and drayage.  All of these factors contributed to
increasing our operating income by 31.4% in 2007.


DCS
Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 2.3% to $937
million in 2007, from $915 million in 2006. 
This increase in revenue was primarily due to a 1.4% increase in revenue
per truck per week and a slightly higher average truck count.

Operating income decreased to $94
million in 2007, compared with $104 million in 2006.  The decrease in operating income was
primarily the result of an increase in driver compensation, increases in fuel
costs and higher casualty and workers’ compensation costs in 2007 compared with
2006.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined
12.8% to $842 million in 2007, from $966 million in 2006.  The decrease in revenue was primarily a
result of a 9.1% decrease in load count, due to much softer demand in 2007
compared with 2006.  An approximate 2%
decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue.

Operating income in our JBT segment
declined to $32 million in 2007, from $84 million in 2006.  In addition to reduced revenue from lower
load volume, operating expenses were higher in 2007, compared with 2006, due to
increases in tractor maintenance and tire costs.  In addition, we recorded an $8.4 million
pretax charge in December 2007 to write down the value of certain assets
held for sale.

ICS
Segment

ICS segment revenue grew 118.9% to $92
million in 2007, from $42 million in 2006. 
This increase in revenue was primarily due to a 148.4% increase in load
volume from both new and existing customers

Operating income increased nearly 27.7%
to $4 million in 2007, compared with $3 million in 2006.  The large revenue growth was partially offset
by increased operating expenses, including higher personnel and technology
costs related to growing and investing in the ICS segment.  In the second half of 2007, we were able to
gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover
higher operating expenses.

2006 Compared With 2005

Overview of Consolidated
2006 Results

Our total consolidated operating
revenues rose to $3.33 billion in 2006, a 6.4% increase over 2005. 
Significantly higher fuel prices resulted in FSC revenues of $430 million in
2006, compared with $336 million in 2005.  This FSC revenue impacted our
year-to-year comparison.  If FSC revenues were excluded from both years,
the increase of 2006 revenue over 2005 was 3.8%.  This increased level of
revenue, excluding FSC, was primarily a result of increases in load volume and
price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions.  A 5.1%
and 2.2% increase in 2006 JBI and DCS load volume, respectively, contributed to
our higher levels of revenue.  The increases in revenue of our JBI and DCS
segments were partially offset by decreases in our JBT segment as a result of a
smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization.  Demand for dry-van truck capacity was softer,
particularly during the fourth quarter of 2006.  Comparisons of 2006
dry-van volumes to 2005 were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments
in 2005 and lower-than-expected seasonal demand during August through November of
2006.  Partly in response to changing market conditions, we increased the
size of our JBI and DCS tractor fleets by 16% and 7%, respectively, and
decreased our JBT fleet by 6%.

Consolidated Operating
Expenses

Our total 2006
consolidated operating expenses increased 6.2% over 2005.  The combination of the 6.4% increase in 2006
revenue over 2005 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2006
operating ratio improving slightly to 88.8% from 89.0% in 2005.  Rents and purchased transportation costs rose
6.3% in 2006, primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage
companies


related to JBI growth.  The total
cost of salaries, wages and employee benefits increased 4.3% in 2006 over 2005,
primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation.

Fuel and fuel taxes
expense was up 15.0% in 2006, primarily due to 12.6% higher fuel cost per
gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon.  It is not meaningful to compare the amount of
FSC revenue or the change of FSC revenue between reporting periods to fuel and
fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a
significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads,
dray carriers and other third parties. 
These payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.  While we are not always able to recover all
fuel cost increases, partly due to empty miles run and engine-idling time, we
were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs.

The 12.6% increase in
depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment
purchases, higher new-tractor purchase prices, and an approximate 5% increase
in the size of our company-owned tractor fleet. 
Operating supplies and expenses rose 9.7% in 2006, partly a result of
higher tractor maintenance, tires and tolls costs.  A number of states have raised their rates
for highway and bridge tolls.  The 27.7%
decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver recruiting and
testing costs, legal and professional fees related to our arbitration
proceeding, and charitable contributions in 2005 that declined or did not
reoccur in 2006.  Also included in the
general and administrative expense category, we recognized a $2.9 million net
gain on the disposition of assets in 2006, compared with a $1.8 million gain in
2005.  The arbitration settlement expense
incurred during 2005 was due to the BNI arbitration decision discussed in the
section on Operating Segments.

We accrued approximately
$3.0 million of interest expense during 2006 related to an IRS
contingency.  Our effective income tax
rate was 37.9% in 2006 and 2005. The “equity in loss of affiliated company”
item on our Consolidated Statement of Earnings reflects our share of the
operating results of TPI.

JBI
Segment

JBI segment revenue grew by 11.4% to
$1.43 billion in 2006, from $1.28 billion in 2005.  A significant portion of this revenue growth
was driven by a 5.1% increase in load volume.  
In addition, freight rates increased nearly 4% over 2005.  The remaining portion of revenue growth was
primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue.

Operating income in our JBI segment rose
to $182 million in 2006, from $124 million in 2005.  The $25.8 million arbitration settlement
charge incurred in September 2005 favorably impacted this comparison.  While this settlement also increased rail
purchased transportation expense subsequent to October 1, 2005, higher
freight rates, increased volumes and reduced use of rail control equipment
increased 2006 operating income.

DCS
Segment

DCS segment revenue grew 8.4% to $915
million in 2006, from $844 million in 2005. 
This increase in revenue was primarily due to a 2.2% increase in load
volume, an approximate 4% increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue.

Operating income increased to $104
million in 2006, compared with $100 million in 2005.  Similar to 2005, we conducted reviews of our
underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either
improve margins or redeploy assets. 
Financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure
helped ensure that new business during 2006 generated appropriate financial
returns.  We also remained focused on
cost controls and raised rates when appropriate.

JBT
Segment

JBT segment revenue declined
2.4% to $966 million in 2006, from $990 million in 2005.  This decline was primarily due to a 1.6%
reduction in load volume.  While rates
from consistent shippers increased


approximately
2% during 2006, a decline in rates from spot and backup pricing and paid empty
movements partly offset these increases.

Operating income in our JBT segment
declined to $84 million in 2006, from $117 million in 2005.  The decrease was due, in part, to lower
levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver compensation and insurance
costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $458 million in 2007, $423 million in 2006 and $332
million in 2005.  The increase in 2007
cash provided by operating activities relative to 2006, after consideration of
adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation, share-based compensation and
impairment charges, was due primarily to the timing of cash activity related to
trade accounts receivable and payable.

Cash flows used in investing
activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of
revenue equipment.  The lower level of
cash used in investing activities during 2007 was primarily a result of
decreases in trailing-equipment purchases. 
At December 31, 2007, we had no revenue equipment on capital
leases.

Net cash used in financing
activities during 2007 increased over 2006, primarily due to the purchase of
$603 million of our common stock.  This
increase was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from long-term debt
issuances.  During 2007, we issued $400
million of senior notes.  Funds from
these issuances were used primarily for purchases of our company stock,
purchases of revenue equipment and for general working capital purposes.

Selected Balance Sheet Data

Our
dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors and
payments are dependent upon our financial condition, earnings, capital
requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant.  We paid a $0.06 per share
dividend in February, April, July and October 2005.  In January 2006, we announced an increase
in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.08.  We paid an $0.08 per share dividend in
February, April, July, and October 2006. 
In January 2007, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash
dividend from $0.08 to $0.09, effective with our payments in February, April,
July, and October 2007.  In January 2008,
we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.09 to $0.10,
effective with our payment in February 2008.  We currently intend to continue paying cash
dividends on a quarterly basis.  However,
no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.

Liquidity

Our
need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal
trailing equipment, trucks, tractors and dry-van trailers required to support
our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new, late-model
equipment.  We are frequently able to
accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market
conditions.  We have, during the past few
years, obtained capital through cash generated from operations and revolving
lines of credit and most recently issued long-term debt to acquire trailers
that were previously leased.  We have
also periodically utilized operating leases to


acquire
revenue equipment.  We had no capital
lease arrangements at December 31, 2007. To date, none of our operating
leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses.

At
December 31, 2007, we were authorized to borrow up to a total of $575 million
under two different revolving lines of credit. 
The first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group
of banks for a total commitment amount of $350 million.  Effective March 29, 2007, we entered
into a new senior revolving credit facility agreement, which replaced our
previous senior revolving credit facility dated April 27, 2005.  This new credit facility has a five-year term
expiring March 29, 2012.  In June 2007,
we exercised a feature of the agreement that allowed us to increase our total
commitment amount from $250 million to $350 million.  The applicable interest rate under this
agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon the
specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and
our credit rating.  At December 31,
2007, we had $210.6 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.84%
under this agreement.

Our
second line of credit is an Accounts Receivable Securitization program with a
revolving-credit facility up to $225 million. 
This facility is secured by our accounts receivable, and we renewed this
facility at maturity on July 30, 2007, for a one-year term maturing on July 28,
2008.  The applicable interest rate under
this agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper rate in the market plus
a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees.  At December 31, 2007, we had $220
million outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.32% under this agreement.

On March 29, 2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31%
Senior Notes (2011 Notes), which mature March 29,

2011, to
various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our Note
Purchase Agreement dated March 15, 2007. 
The proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off
operating leases and for general working capital purposes.  The 2011 Notes were issued at par value.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in March and
September of each year.

On
July 26, 2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08% Senior Notes (2014 Notes),
which mature July 26, 2014, to various purchasers through a private
placement offering pursuant to our Note Purchase Agreement dated July 15,
2007.  Proceeds from these notes have been utilized to purchase shares of
our common stock, pay down existing debt on our revolving-credit facilities and
finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment.  The 2014 Notes were issued at par value.  Principal payments in the amount of $50.0 million
are due July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder due upon
maturity.  Interest payments are due
semiannually, in January and July of each year. The Note Purchase
Agreements describe the terms and conditions of both Notes, which include
requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.

On
September 29, 2006, we entered into a $100 million term loan and credit
agreement in connection with our purchase of used, dry-van trailers.  This $100 million facility is collateralized
by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures September 29,
2009.  We are required to make minimum
quarterly principal payments in the amount of $3.5 million, through June 29,
2009, with the remainder due upon maturity. 
Stated interest on this facility is a three-month LIBOR variable
rate.  Concurrent with the loan and
credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of
5.85%.  The swap expires September 29,
2009, when the related term loan is due. 
At December 31, 2007, we had $82.5 million outstanding under this
credit agreement.

Our
revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain
covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all covenants
and financial ratios at December 31, 2007.

We
believe that our liquid assets, cash generated from operations and revolving
lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital
requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our
increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock.

As
mentioned above, we had significant expenditures related to new trailing
equipment for 2007.  We are currently
committed to spend approximately $122.4 million during 2008, which is primarily
related to


tractors
and containers.  The actual cash expended
will be net of proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances on revenue equipment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our only off-balance sheet arrangements are related to our
operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing
equipment and facilities.  As of December 31,
2007, we had approximately 303 trailers and 1,005 containers/chassis that were
subject to operating leases, and we had approximately $1.8 million of
obligations remaining under these leases.

Contractual Cash Obligations

As of December 31, 2007

(000)

We
had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately $11.3 million at December 31,
2007, that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2008, which are related to (1) our
self-insured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims,
and (2) our operating lease agreements. 
We plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our
third-party agreements.  The table above excludes $22.7 million
of liabilities under FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,
as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement.  See Note 6, Income Taxes, in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157).  FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair
value measurements.  FAS 157 does not
expand or require new fair value measures, but is applicable whenever an asset
or liability is permitted or required to be measured at fair value.  FAS 157 became effective for us beginning January 1,
2008.  In February 2008, the FASB
agreed to a one-year delay of FAS 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and
liabilities.  Accordingly, adoption of
this standard is limited to financial assets and liabilities, which primarily
applies to the valuation of our interest rate swap.  We do not believe the initial adoption of FAS
157 will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition.  We are still in the process of assessing the
impact of FAS 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements for nonfinancial
assets and liabilities.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159).  FAS
159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and
liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are
reported in earnings.  FAS 159 became
effective for us on January 1, 2008. 
We do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a significant
impact on our earnings or financial condition as we expect election of this
option to be limited.


ITEM 7A

.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Of
our total $913.1 million of debt, we had $430.6 million of variable rate debt
outstanding at December 31, 2007, under our revolving lines of
credit.  The interest rates applicable to
these agreements are based on either the prime rate or LIBOR.  Our earnings would be affected by changes in
these short-term interest rates.  Risk
can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse
increase in short-term interest rates. 
At our current level of borrowing, a 1% increase in our applicable rate
would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately $4.3 million.  Our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate
debt, and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our
interest expense.  Periodically, we enter
into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates.

Although
we conduct business in foreign countries, international operations are not
material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.  Additionally, foreign currency

transaction gains and losses were not material to
our results of operations for the year ended December 31,

2007.  Accordingly, we are not currently
subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that
exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or
on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment.  To date, we have not entered into any foreign
currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments
to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The
price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to
changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather and other
market factors.  Historically, we have
been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in
the form of fuel surcharges.  We cannot
predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future
or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such
increases.  As of December 31, 2007,
we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.  Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitation,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007.  In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

. 
Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2007,
our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
criteria.

The effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been audited by
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm
that also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Ernst & Young LLP’s report on
internal control over financial reporting is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
and subsidiaries

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of J.B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes, and as discussed in
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed
its method of accounting for share-based compensation.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related information appearing in this

very seriously and are committed to maintaining controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that we collect the information we are required to
disclose in our reports to the SEC and to process, summarize and disclose this
information within the time periods specified by the SEC.

Based on
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, and conducted by our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
believe that our controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we are
able to collect, process and disclose the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed with the SEC within the required time periods.

We are
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the

internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation

criteria). J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries’ management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007 and our report dated February 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated

Financial Statements

1.

Business

J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is one of the largest full-load
and multimodal transportation service companies in North America.  We operate four distinct, but complementary,
business segments and provide a wide range of general and specifically tailored
freight and logistics services to our customers.  We generate revenues primarily from the
actual movement of freight from shippers to consignees and from serving as a
logistics provider by offering or arranging for others to provide the
transportation service.  Unless otherwise
indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt
Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

2.

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis of
Consolidation

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all of our wholly owned
subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
Estimates

The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.  The
preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that directly affect the amounts reported in such statements and accompanying
notes.  We evaluate these estimates on an
ongoing basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and
using other methods we consider reasonable in the particular
circumstances.  Nevertheless, our actual
results may differ significantly from our estimates.

We believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more
significance in our financial statement preparation process than others.  We believe the most critical accounting
policies and estimates include the economic useful lives and salvage values of
our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of
exposures under our insurance and claims plans, and estimates for taxes.  To the extent that actual, final outcomes are
different than our estimates, or that additional facts and circumstances cause
us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that accounting period will be
affected.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in
short-term, highly liquid investments. 
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable
Allowance

Our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by
an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments.  The allowance for uncollectible accounts and
revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known
trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account
collectibility.  The adequacy of our
allowance is reviewed quarterly.  The
allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments was $4.9 million
and $6.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


Inventory

Our inventories consist primarily of revenue
equipment parts, tires, supplies and fuel and are valued using the lower of
average cost or market.

Investments in Marketable
Equity Securities

Our investments consist of marketable equity
securities stated at fair value and are designated as either trading securities
or available-for-sale securities at the time of purchase based upon the
intended holding period.  Changes in fair
value of our trading securities are recognized currently in “general and
administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions” in our Consolidated
Statements of Earnings.  Changes in the
fair value of our available-for-sale securities are recognized in “accumulated
other comprehensive income” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless we
determine that an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary.  If we determine that an unrealized loss is
other-than-temporary, we recognize the loss in earnings.

At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our
investments classified as available-for-sale securities was $8.8 million.  We had no investments classified as
available-for-sale at December 31, 2006. 
See Note 7, Employee Benefit Plans, for a discussion of our trading
securities.

Property
and Equipment

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 4 to 10 years for
tractors and 7 to 20 years for trailing equipment, 10 to 40 years for
structures and improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office
equipment.  Salvage values are typically
10% to 20% for tractors and trailing equipment and consider any agreements with
tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment.  We capitalize tires placed in service on new
revenue equipment as a part of the equipment cost.  Replacement tires and costs for recapping
tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in service.  Gains and losses on the sale or other
disposition of equipment are recognized at the time of the disposition and are
classified in general and administrative expenses.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize revenue based on relative transit time in each reporting
period, with expenses recognized as incurred.

Derivative Instruments

We account for derivatives in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(FAS 133), as
amended.  We periodically utilize
derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.  At inception of a derivative contract, we
document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well
as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative
transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. 
If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue
hedge accounting prospectively.  In 2006,
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert a portion of our
variable rate debt to a fixed interest rate. 
This derivative instrument is accounted for as a cash flow hedge in
accordance with FAS 133.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(FAS 109), as amended.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to


differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as
income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  See Note 6, Income Taxes, regarding a change
in our accounting for uncertain tax positions.

Earnings
Per Share

We
compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings available to common
shareholders by the actual weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the reporting period.  Diluted
earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if holders
of options or unvested restricted share units exercised or converted their
holdings into common stock. Outstanding stock options and unvested restricted
share units represent the dilutive effects on weighted average shares. A
reconciliation of the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted
earnings per share is shown below (in thousands):

Options to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding during
each year, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share because the options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares, are shown in the table below.

On April 21, 2005, we announced a
two-for-one stock split on our common stock, payable May 23, 2005, to
stockholders of record on May 2, 2005. 
All references in our financial statements with regard to number of
shares and the per-share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
this stock split.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk, include trade receivables. 
For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our top 10
customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 38%, 40% and 40%,
respectively, of our total revenue.  Our
top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 34% of our
total trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 and 2006.  One customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
accounted for 12%, 14% and 15% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Each
of our four business segments conducts business with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Share-Based
Compensation

We have share-based compensation plans covering
certain employees, including officers and directors.  Effective January 1, 2006, we accounted
for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-based
Payment

(FAS 123R).  We currently
are utilizing restricted share units and nonstatutory stock options.  Issuances of our stock upon share option
exercise or vested restricted share units are made from


treasury
stock.  Our restricted share unit awards
include both graded-vesting and cliff-vesting awards and therefore vest in
increments during the requisite service period or all at the end of the
requisite service period as appropriate for each type of vesting.  We recognize compensation expense over the
requisite service period for the entire award.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Assets Held for Sale

We continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or
changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

In December 2007, partly in response to changing market
conditions, we entered into a plan to sell approximately 700 tractors and 2,500
trailers within our JBT segment.  We
expect to sell this equipment during calendar year 2008.  Accordingly, we have discontinued recording
depreciation expense on this revenue equipment effective January 1,
2008.  We reclassified the net book value
from net property and equipment to assets held for sale in our consolidated
balance sheet.  At December 31,
2007, we recorded a pretax charge of $8.4 million to reduce the carrying value
of the revenue equipment to estimated fair value, less cost to sell.  This charge is included in “general and
administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions” in our statement of
earnings.  All amounts were recorded in
our JBT segment.

Claims
Accruals

We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to
employee injuries (workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions, accidents and
cargo claims.  Most of our insurance
arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable
to each claim, but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to
catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured.  Our policies also include a contractual
premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of
48 months from each policy period inception. 
This contractual adjustment factor is used to convert the self-insured
losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on
those claims.  Our estimated accrual of
ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors as part of the
liability we recognize when the accidents occur.

The amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on certain
measurement dates and policy expiration dates. 
During 2005, we were self-insured for $2 million per occurrence for
personal injury and property damage and $1 million per occurrence for workers’
compensation claims.   During 2006 and
2007, we were self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury,
property damage and workers’ compensation. 
For 2008, we are self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal
injury and property damage and $1 million for workers’ compensation claims.

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a
liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and
severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims
administrators, as well as legal, economic and regulatory factors.  Our safety and claims personnel work directly
with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the
estimated cost of each claim.  The
ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding
the nature, timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available.  Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to
develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim
liability.  This process involves the use
of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience and
includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above.  In doing so, the recorded liability considers
future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an
allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. 
We do not discount our estimated losses. 
At December 31, 2007, we had an accrual of approximately $19
million for estimated net claims.  In
addition, we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly
premiums.  At December 31, 2007, we
had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately $53 million,


which
represented prefunded claims and premiums. 
We are also substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our
owned and leased revenue equipment.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(FAS 157).  FAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about
such fair value measurements.  FAS 157
does not expand or require new fair value measures, but is applicable whenever
an asset or liability is permitted or required to be measured at fair value.  FAS 157 became effective for us beginning January 1,
2008.  In February 2008, the FASB
agreed to a one-year delay of FAS 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and
liabilities.  Accordingly, adoption of
this standard is limited to financial assets and liabilities, which primarily
applies to the valuation of our interest rate swap.  We do not believe the initial adoption of FAS
157 will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition.  We are still in the process of assessing the
impact of FAS 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements for nonfinancial
assets and liabilities.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(FAS 159).  FAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure
certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  Unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings.  FAS 159 became effective for us on January 1,
2008.  We do not believe the adoption of this
statement will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition
as we expect election of this option to be limited.

Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following (in
  millions):

Aggregate maturities of
  long-term debt subsequent to December 31, 2007, are as follows (in millions):
  2008 - $234.0 (classified as current portion of long-term debt);
  2009 - $68.5; 2010 - $0.0; 2011 - $200.0; 2012 - $260.6; 2013
  - $50.0; and 2014 - $100.0.

Revolving Lines of Credit

At
December 31, 2007, we were authorized to borrow up to a total of $575
million under two different revolving lines of credit.  The first line of credit is supported by a
credit agreement with a group of banks for a total commitment amount of $350
million.  Effective March 29, 2007,
we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility agreement, which
replaced our previous senior revolving credit facility dated     April 27, 2005.  This new credit facility has a five-year term
expiring March 29, 2012.  In June 2007,
we exercised a feature of the agreement which allowed us to increase our total
commitment amount from $250 million to $350 million.  The applicable interest rate under this
agreement is based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, depending upon the
specific type of borrowing, plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and
our credit rating.  At December 31,
2007, we had $210.6 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.84%
under this agreement.

Our
second line of credit is an Accounts Receivable Securitization program with a
revolving credit facility up to $225 million. 
This facility is secured by our accounts receivable, and we renewed this
facility at maturity on July 30, 2007, for a one-year term maturing on July 28,
2008.  The applicable interest rate


under
this agreement is the prevailing A1/P1 commercial paper rate in the market plus
a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees.  At December 31, 2007, we had $220
million outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.32% under this agreement.

Senior Notes

On
March 29, 2007, we sold $200 million of 5.31% Senior Notes (2011 Notes),
which mature      March 29, 2011, to
various purchasers through a private-placement offering pursuant to our Note
Purchase Agreement dated March 15, 2007. 
The proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off
operating leases and for general working capital purposes.  The 2011 Notes were issued at par value.  Interest payments are due semiannually, in March and
September of each year.

On
July 26, 2007, we sold $200 million of 6.08% Senior Notes (2014 Notes),
which mature July 26, 2014, to various purchasers through a
private-placement offering pursuant to our Note Purchase Agreement dated July 15,
2007.  Proceeds from these notes have been utilized to purchase shares of
our common stock, pay down existing debt on our revolving credit facilities and
finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment.  The 2014 Notes were issued at par value.  Principal payments in the amount of $50.0
million are due July 26, 2012, and July 26, 2013, with the remainder
due upon maturity.  Interest payments are
due semiannually, in January and July of each year. The Note Purchase
Agreements describe the terms and conditions of both Notes, which include
requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.

Term Loan

On
September 29, 2006, we entered into a $100 million term loan and credit
agreement in connection with our purchase of used, dry-van trailers.  This $100 million facility is collateralized
by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures September 29,
2009.  We are required to make minimum
quarterly principal payments in the amount of $3.5 million through June 29,
2009, with the remainder due upon maturity.  Stated interest on this facility is a 3-month
LIBOR variable rate.  Concurrent with the
loan and credit agreement, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of
5.85%.  The swap expires September 29,
2009, when the related term loan is due. 
At December 31, 2007, we had $82.5 million outstanding under this
credit agreement.

Our
revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain
covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all covenants
and financial ratios at December 31, 2007.

4.

Capital Stock

We
have one class of preferred stock and one class of common stock.  We had no outstanding shares of preferred
stock at December 31, 2007 or 2006. 
Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends when
and if declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to one vote per
share on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders.  At December 31, 2007, we had 8.8 million
shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise or vesting of equity
awards and 12.7 million shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to
share-based payment plans.

On December 14, 2004,
our Board authorized the purchase of up to $100 million worth of our common
stock. We commenced purchases of our common stock in January 2005 and
completed purchases under this authorization in March 2005.  On April 21, 2005, our Board authorized
the purchase of an additional $500 million of our common stock over the next
five years.  Purchases under that
authorization were completed in March 2007.  On May 2, 2007, our Board authorized up
to $500 million in additional purchases of our common stock over the next 12
months.  During the calendar year ended December 31,
2007, we completed purchases under the May 2, 2007, authorization.

5.

Share-based Compensation

We
maintain a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that provides various
share-based financial vehicles to compensate our key employees with shares of
our common stock or common stock


equivalents.
Under the Plan, as amended, we have, from time to time, utilized restricted
share unit awards, restricted options and nonstatutory stock options to
compensate our employees and directors. We currently are utilizing restricted
share units and nonstatutory stock options.

Our
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the purchase of
our common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
grant date as awarded by the Compensation Committee. These options generally
vest over a 10-year period and are forfeited immediately if the employee
terminates for any reason other than death, disability or retirement after age
55. An employee is allowed to surrender shares of common stock that the
employee has owned for at least six months in full or partial payment of the
option price of an option being exercised and/or to satisfy tax withholding
obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  We did not grant any stock options during the
years ended December 31, 2007, or December 31, 2006.  We granted 113,000 stock options in 2005.

We
began awarding restricted share units in 2005. These restricted share units
have various vesting schedules ranging from three to ten years when awarded.
These restricted share units do not contain rights to vote or receive dividends
until the vesting date.  Unvested
restricted share units are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason
other than death, disability or special circumstances as determined by the
Compensation Committee.

Prior
to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our share-based compensation using
the intrinsic value method and in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

(APB 25) and related interpretations.  In accordance with this previous guidance,
compensation expense related to stock option grants was recorded on the date of
the grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price.  Under APB 25, we
recognized the cost of restricted share units over the applicable vesting
period.  As a result, we recognized approximately
$0.5 million of expense during 2005 related to our restricted share units.  However, prior to January 1, 2006, we
did not record compensation expense related to unexercised stock options and
provided pro forma disclosure amounts in our footnotes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(FAS 123).

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

(revised 2004) (FAS 123R) requires the cost of
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on the
grant date fair value of those awards. 
In accordance with FAS 123R, this cost will be recognized over the
period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award.  For awards outstanding as of

January

1, 2006, FAS 123R required us
to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding
share-based payments based on the fair value of the award on the grant
date.  It also required that the benefits
associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be
reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow.  We adopted FAS 123R, effective January 1,
2006, utilizing the modified prospective method and, therefore, did not restate
our prior-period results.

The
following table illustrates the pro forma impact on calendar year 2005 net
earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition
provision of FAS 123:


The
weighted-average fair value of each stock option included in the preceding pro
forma amounts was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying
options. The following assumptions were utilized for options granted in
calendar year 2005:

Share-based
compensation expense is recorded in salaries, wages and employee benefits in
our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, along with other compensation expenses
to employees.  The following table
summarizes the components of our share-based compensation program expense (in
thousands):

A
summary of our nonstatutory stock options and restricted share units follows:


Stock Options

The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock
options granted was $10.76 for the year ended December 31, 2005.  No stock options were granted during the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Restricted Share Units

At
December 31, 2007, we had $13.8 million and $33.5 million of total
unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures related to
stock options and restricted share units, respectively, that is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately 2.6
years for stock options and 2.8 years for restricted share units.

6.

Income Taxes

Income tax
expense (benefit) attributable to earnings before income taxes consists of (in
thousands):


Income
tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes differed from the
amounts computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% as follows
(in thousands):

Income
taxes payable at December 31, 2007, were $9.9 million, and income taxes
refundable at December 31, 2006, were $11.8 million.  These amounts have been included in other
accrued expenses and income tax receivable on the balance sheet,
respectively.  The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are
presented below (in thousands):

We
believe our history of profitability and taxable income, the reversal of deferred
tax liabilities, and our utilization of tax planning sufficiently support the
carrying amount of the deferred tax assets. 
Accordingly, we have not recorded a valuation allowance, as all deferred
tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
treatment for uncertain tax positions. 
FIN 48 prescribes recognition and measurement guidance and requires that
we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions taken are more likely than
not of being sustained under tax audits.  We adopted the provisions
of FIN 48, effective January 1, 2007.  Prior to adoption, we
accounted for uncertain tax positions under Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 5,


Accounting for Contingencies

(FAS 5), whereby we recorded
liabilities associated with tax uncertainties when the likelihood of occurrence
was probable and we were able to reasonably estimate the liability.  As a result of this adoption, we recognized
an increase in noncurrent deferred tax assets of $29.4 million and an increase
in other long-term liabilities of $36.9 million with a corresponding reduction
to beginning retained earnings of $7.5 million, as of January 1,
2007.  We have not restated prior-period results.  For the year ended December 31, 2007, we
have made adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits that is a
component of other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as follows:

In
June 2007, we completed a Post Appeals Mediation with the IRS, whereby we
agreed to a settlement of a sale-and-leaseback transaction and other uncertain
tax positions related to the IRS audits for tax years 1998-2003.  As a result of this settlement, we made a
cash payment to the IRS for previous tax liabilities, including interest, in
the amount of $49.5 million.  No
penalties have been proposed or paid on these deficiencies.  We adjusted the amount of the accrued
liability in excess of the net settlement amount in June 2007, which
resulted in a decrease in the income tax expense of approximately $12.1 million.

At
December 31, 2007, we had a total of $17.1 million in gross unrecognized
tax benefits.  Of this amount, $11.1 million represents the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax
rate.  Interest and penalties related to income taxes are classified as
interest expense in our consolidated financial statements.  The total
amount accrued during the year ended December 31, 2007, was $6.4
million.  Future changes to unrecognized
tax benefits will be recognized as income tax expense and interest expense, as
appropriate.  The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, was $5.6 million.

We
believe only tax years 2004 and forward remain subject to examination by
federal tax jurisdictions, while tax years 1997 and forward remain open for
state jurisdictions.

Employee Benefit Plans

We
maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a 401(k) option,
under which all employees are eligible to participate.  We match a specified percentage of employee
contributions, subject to certain limitations. 
For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our matching
contributions to the plan were $7.9 million, $7.5 million and $7.6 million,
respectively.

We
have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees
to defer a portion of their compensation. 
Participants can elect to defer up to a maximum of 50% of their base
salary as well as up to 85% of their bonus for the year.  The compensation deferred under this plan is
credited with earnings or losses of investments elected by plan
participants.  Each participant is fully
vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however, these amounts are
subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed to the
employee.  A participant may elect to
receive deferred amounts in one payment or, if the balance is greater than
$25,000, in quarterly installments payable over a period of 3, 5, 10 or 15
years upon reaching age 55, having 15 years of service, or becoming
disabled.  Our total liability under this
plan was $9.7 million as of December 31, 2007, and $8.6 million as of December 31,
2006.  These amounts are included in
other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Participant withholdings are held by a
trustee and invested in equity securities as directed by participants.

These
investments are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair
value.  Realized and unrealized gains and
losses are recognized currently in earnings. 
The investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and totaled $9.7 million as of December 31, 2007, and $8.6 million
as of December 31, 2006.

Derivative and Financial
Instruments

Interest
rate swap

On
September 29, 2006, we entered into an agreement to swap the variable rate
on our $100 million term loan and credit facility for a fixed 5.85% interest
rate. This interest rate swap effectively converts the floating rate debt to a
fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future
interest expense. The swap expires September 29, 2009, when the related
term loan is due. The derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability of
cash flows to be paid related to the term loan and meets the required criteria
of a cash flow hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. Accordingly, changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects
earnings to the extent the derivative is effective in offsetting gains and
losses of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The ineffective portion
of gains and losses, if any, is recorded in current earnings through interest
expense.  The fair value of the swap is
recorded in other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2007.

and interest rate swap contract at December 31, 2007, were as follows (in

Related-Party Transactions

In
October 2005, we announced a $10 million gift to the University of
Arkansas to facilitate the construction of a new J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
Center for Academic Excellence building. 
Dr. John A. White has been a member of our Board of Directors since
1998 and serves as the Chairman of our Audit Committee.  Dr. White is the Chancellor of the
University of Arkansas.  Johnelle D. Hunt
serves as our Corporate Secretary and has been a member of our Board of
Directors since 1993.  Mrs. Hunt
served as Treasurer for the University of Arkansas’ Campaign for the 21st
Century.  Neither of the aforementioned
board members was instrumental in securing this contribution, nor did either
participate in the voting processes related to this transaction.

Commitments and
Contingencies

As
of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $7.3 million of obligations
remaining under operating lease arrangements related to trailing equipment and
terminal facilities.  None of our
operating leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses.  Under the terms of certain lease agreements,
we are required to maintain certain covenants, including minimum credit
ratings.  We were in compliance with
these requirements at December 31, 2007.

Future
minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or
remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2007, are
approximately $7.3 million, with payment streams as follows (in thousands):
2008 - $4,275; 2009 - $1,581; 2010 - $750; 2011 - $566; and 2012 - $121.

Total
rent expense was $29.2 million in 2007, $78.8 million in 2006, and $93.5
million in 2005.

At
December 31, 2007, we had outstanding commitments to acquire approximately
$122.4 million of revenue equipment and facilities in 2008.  This amount is net of $81.1 million of expected
allowances and sales proceeds from equipment dispositions.

During
2007, we issued financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our
performance under certain operating lease commitments and self-insurance
arrangements.  If we default on our commitments
under the lease agreements or other arrangements, we are required to perform
under these guarantees.  The undiscounted
maximum amount of our obligation to make future payments in the event of
defaults is approximately $11.3 million.

We
are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the
normal conduct of business.  Based on the
present knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside
counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of
operations or our liquidity.

Affiliated Company

We
have a 37% ownership interest in a logistics joint venture called Transplace, Inc.
(TPI). TPI was formed in July 2000 when we, along with five other motor
carriers, contributed our existing non-asset-based logistics business to the
new entity.  No gain or loss was
recognized upon the formation of TPI.  We
routinely enter into transactions with TPI regarding the movement of
freight.  Prior to January 1, 2007,
we provided various services to TPI under a shared-service agreement, primarily
related to computer system operations, services and maintenance.  We earn transportation revenues from and
purchase transportation services from TPI. 
We also utilize travel services provided by TPI.  We, along with the other motor carriers,
advanced funds to TPI in the form of a note receivable during 2005, and in January 2007
we extended the due date on this note to January 2009.  In 2006, we reduced the remainder of our
original investment in the joint venture to zero as a result of our equity in
loss of TPI.  During 2006 and 2007, we
have reduced the balance of the note receivable by the amount of our equity in
loss of TPI. This note receivable balance, including accrued interest, was $4.4
million at December 31, 2007, after the reduction based on our equity in
loss of TPI, and carried an interest rate of 6.0%.  This note receivable from TPI is classified
as an other long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
2007.  When the note is paid, any
reduction in the value of the note as a result of our portion of equity losses
in TPI will be recovered and recorded as a gain in the period collected.  A summary of our revenues and expenses
related to TPI for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2007, and
balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2007 and 2006, is presented below
(in millions):

Segment Information

We
have four reportable business segments, Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS), Truck (JBT), and Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), which are
based primarily on the services each provides. 
The JBI segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at
least some portion of the movement and also includes certain repositioning
truck freight moved by JBI equipment or third-party carriers, when such highway
movement is intended to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal
operations.  DCS segment business
typically includes company-owned revenue equipment and employee drivers
assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS operations usually include formal,
written long-term agreements or contracts that govern services performed and
applicable rates.  JBT business includes
full-load dry-van freight that is typically transported utilizing company-owned
or company-controlled revenue equipment. 
This freight is typically transported over roads and highways and does
not move by rail.  ICS provides non-asset
and asset-light transportation solutions to customers through relationships
with third-party carriers and integration with JBHT owned equipment.  ICS services include flatbed, refrigerated
and less-than-truckload (LTL), as well as a variety of dry van and intermodal
solutions.  All significant transactions
between reporting segments are eliminated in consolidation.

As
previously disclosed, an arbitration process commenced in 2004, with BNSF
Railway (BNI).  BNI provides a
significant amount of rail transportation services to our JBI business
segment.  The arbitration process was
initiated in accordance with the terms of our Joint Service Agreement (JSA)
with BNI, after we were unable to resolve our disagreements through
mediation.  A final award was declared in
2005 by the arbitration panel, whereby we recorded, in the third quarter 2005,
pretax charges of $25.8 million.  Normal
commercial business activity between the parties, including load tendering,
load tracing, billing and payments, has continued on a timely basis during the
entire mediation and arbitration process.

Prior
to 2007, ICS financial results were reported as part of the JBT segment.  Beginning January 1, 2007, we began
reporting ICS results separately. 
Prior-period information has been restated.

Our customers are
geographically dispersed across the United States.  One customer accounted for approximately 12%,
14% and 15% of consolidated operating revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  A summary of certain
segment information as of December 31 is presented below (in millions):


(1)

Business
segment assets exclude the net impact of intercompany transactions and
accounts.

(2)

Includes a $25.8 million
pretax charge in 2005 for the BNI arbitration settlement.

(3)

Includes an $8.4 million
pretax charge in 2007 to write down the value of certain assets held for sale.
