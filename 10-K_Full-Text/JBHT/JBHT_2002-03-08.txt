PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

GENERAL

J.B.

Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries

(“JBHT” or the “Company”), is a diversified transportation services company

operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)

and various state regulatory agencies. 

JBHT is an Arkansas holding company incorporated on August 10,

1961.  Through its subsidiaries and

associated companies, JBHT provides a wide range of logistics and

transportation services to a diverse group of customers.  The Company directly manages or provides

tailored, technology-driven solutions to a growing list of Fortune 500

companies.  These customers may request

specifically targeted transportation service or outsource their entire

transportation function to JBHT, or an associated company.  The Company also directly transports

full-load containerizable freight throughout the continental United States and

portions of Canada and Mexico. 

Transportation services may utilize JBHT equipment and employees, or may

employ equipment and services provided by associated or unrelated third parties

in the transportation industry.  The

Company had three reportable business segments during calendar year 2001.  These segments included dry-van truck only

(JBT), intermodal (JBI) and dedicated contract services (DCS).  In addition, JBHT operated a logistics

business segment from 1992 until mid 2000. 

Effective July 1, 2000, the Company, along with four other large

publicly-held transportation companies, contributed its logistics business to a

new, commonly owned company, Transplace, Inc.

JBT SEGMENT

Primary transportation service offerings

classified in this segment include full truck-load, dry-van, freight which is

predominantly transported utilizing company-owned revenue equipment.  Freight is picked up at the dock or

specified location of the shipper and transported directly to the location of

the consignee.  The load may be

transported entirely by company-owned and controlled power equipment or a

portion of the movement may be handled by a third-party motor carrier.

Typically, the charges for the entire movement are billed to the customer by

the Company and the Company, in turn, pays the third-party for their portion of

the transportation services provided. 

JBT operates utilizing certain Canadian authorities which were initially

granted in 1988 and may transport freight to and from all points in the

continental United States to Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario.  The Company has authorization to operate

directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date has served limited points

in Canada, primarily through interchange operations with Canadian motor

carriers.  The Company operated its JBT

and JBI segments in combined fashion in periods prior to January 1, 2000.  This combined operation was reported as

Van/Intermodal (“Van”) in prior periods.  

In late 2000, the  Company began

utilizing independent contractors on a limited basis in the JBT segment.  These independent contractors  (I/C’s) own their tractors and agree to

transport freight in Company owned or controlled trailing equipment.  At December 31, 2001, approximately 340

I/C’s were operating in the JBT segment. 

JBT gross revenue for calendar year 2001 was $829 million, compared with

$834 million in 2000.  At December 31,

2001, the JBT segment operated approximately 5,380 company owned tractors and

employed 8,270 people, 6,373 of whom were drivers.

JBI SEGMENT

Transportation service offerings of the

JBI segment utilize agreements with various railroads to provide proven

intermodal freight solutions to JBI customers in all major lanes of commerce in

the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 

The Company differentiates itself from others through its premium

service network, as well as, coordinated door to door service on company-owned

and controlled assets.  The Company

established its first intermodal agreement with the Santa Fe Railway in

1989.  Through growth of this

transportation segment and additions, deletions, and mergers of rail carriers,

the Company now has agreements with seven North American rail carriers

including:  BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX,

Kansas City Southern, Union Pacific, Canadian National, and Florida East Coast

railroads.  Typically, freight is picked

up at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transported to the rail

carrier for loading on to rail cars. 

Upon completion of the rail routing, the freight is picked up at the

rail carrier’s ramp and transported to the consignee.  These originating and destination drays may be transported

entirely by company-owned and controlled power equipment or may be handled by a

third-party motor carrier.  It is the

Company’s customary business practice that all charges for the entire movement

are billed to the customer by the Company and the Company, in turn, pays the

rail carrier and third-party motor carrier for their portion of the

transportation services provided.  In

1993, rail operations were expanded to utilize high-cube containers which can

be separated from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars to provide

improved productivity.  This concept is

known as container-on-flatcar (COFC). 

The agreements the Company has with its rail carriers allow for the majority

of JBI business carried under these rail agreements to receive priority space

on trains and preferential loading and


unloading at rail

facilities.  JBI gross revenue for

calendar year 2001 was $740 million, compared with $681 million in  2000. 

At December 31, 2001, the JBI segment operated approximately 910

tractors and employed 1,608 people, 1,288 of whom were drivers.

DCS SEGMENT

Since 1992, JBHT has offered dedicated

contract carriage as a service option. 

DCS segment operations specialize in the design, development, and

execution of supply chain solutions. 

Capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies, DCS offers engineered

transportation solutions that support private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet

creation, and transportation system augmentation.  DCS operations typically provide customized services that are

governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry van, flatbed, and

temperature-controlled operations.  Near

100% on-time service is standard with efficient routes executed to design

specifications.

DCS operations focus on driving out cost

and enhancing customer value through leveraging the JBHT network for backhaul

repositioning freight.  Network freight

may be used to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles,  thereby 

reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost.  DCS also frequently finds synergy in shared

resources with the JBT and JBI segments including terminals, maintenance shops,

bulk fuel locations, and trailer pools providing further economies of

scale.  DCS gross revenue for calendar

year 2001 was $549 million, compared with $479 million in 2000.  At December 31, 2001, the DCS segment

operated approximately 4,480 tractors and employed 5,383 people, 4,633 of whom

were drivers.

LOGISTICS BUSINESS AND ASSOCIATED

COMPANY

The Company formally began offering logistics transportation

services in 1992 through a wholly-owned subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics

(JBL).  JBL services frequently included

an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a substantial portion of its

entire distribution and transportation process to one organization.  The JBL segment business included a wide

range of comprehensive transportation and management services including

experienced professional managers, information and optimization technology, and

the actual design or redesign of system solutions.  A new logistics customer or service arrangement may have required

a significant amount of up-front analysis and design time, while alternatives

were considered and custom systems and software were developed. Effective July

1, 2000, the Company contributed substantially all of its JBL segment business,

all related intangible assets and $5 million of cash  to a newly-formed, commonly-owned company, Transplace, Inc.

(“TPC”).

TPC is an Internet-based global transportation logistics

company.  TPC commenced operations in

July of 2000 and initially included substantially all of the logistics business

of the Company, Covenant Transport, Inc.; Swift Transportation Co., Inc; U.S.

Xpress Enterprises, Inc., and Werner Enterprises, Inc.  TPC gross revenue for calendar year 2001

approximated $702 million, which revenue is not included in the Company’s

financial statements for 2001.  The

Company presently has an approximate 27% ownership interest in TPC and,

accordingly, utilizes the equity method of accounting.  The financial results of TPC are included on

a one-line, non-operating item included on the Consolidated Statements of

Earnings entitled “equity in earnings of associated companies.”

ASSOCIATED

COMPANY - MEXICO

The Company has provided transportation services to and from

Mexico since 1989.  These services

frequently involve equipment interchange operations with various Mexican motor

carriers.  A joint venture agreement

with Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, one of the largest transportation

companies in Mexico, was signed in 1992. 

The joint venture, Comercializadora Internacional de Carga, St. de CV

and its subsidiaries, originate and complete northbound and southbound international

truck movements between the U.S. and Mexico. 

The joint venture also provides Mexican domestic irregular route truck

service, refrigerated freight services, Mexican dedicated contract business and

short-haul drayage to and from the Mexican maritime ports and rail heads.  For the calendar year ended December 31,

2001 and for prior years, the Company’s share of its Mexican joint venture

operating results were included on a one-line, non-operating item on the

Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled “equity in earnings of associated

companies.  The Company anticipates a

sale of its interest, which is expected to be consummated in early 2002.


MARKETING AND  OPERATIONS

JBHT transports a wide range of products including automotive

parts, department store merchandise, paper and wood products, food and

beverages, plastics, chemicals and manufacturing materials and supplies.  The Company’s primary customers include many

of the  “Fortune 500” companies, but no

single customer accounted for more than 15% of revenues during 2001.  A broad geographic dispersion and a good

balance in the type of freight transported allows JBHT some protection from

major seasonal fluctuations.  However,

consistent with the truckload industry in general, freight is typically

stronger during the second half of the year, with peak volume occurring in

August through mid November.  Revenue

and earnings are also affected by bad weather, holidays, fuel prices, driver

cost and availability, and railroad service levels.

The Company generally markets all of its service offerings

through a nationwide marketing network. 

All transportation services offered are typically billed directly to the

customer by JBHT and all inquiries, claims and other customer contacts are

handled by the Company.  Certain

marketing, sales, engineering and design functions are assigned to each

operating segment.  However, marketing

and pricing strategy, and national account service coordination is managed at

the corporate level.

PERSONNEL

At December 31, 2001, JBHT employed approximately 16,380

people, including 12,294 drivers. 

Historically the truckload transportation industry and the Company have

experienced shortages of qualified drivers. 

In addition, driver turnover rates for truckload motor carriers

frequently exceed 100%.  In September of

1996,  JBHT announced a new compensation

program for the approximate 3,500 over-the-road JBT drivers at that time.  This comprehensive package, which was

effective in February of 1997, included an average 33% increase in wages for

this group of employees.  This program

was designed to attract and retain a professional and experienced work force

capable of delivering a high level of customer service.  As anticipated, this increase in driver

wages and benefits was partially offset by lower driver recruiting and training

expense, reduced accident costs and better equipment utilization.  Primarily due to the over-the-road (OTR)

driver pay change in 1997, average driver turnover rates declined from

approximately 85% in 1996 to the 45% to 50% range during 1997 through

1999.  During late 2000 and 2001, supply

and demand conditions for drivers changed and a number of truck load carriers,

including the Company, implemented lower mileage pay rates for newly hired

drivers.  Partly as a result of this

reduced compensation level for drivers, the Company’s driver turnover rate was

approximately 70% in 2000 and over 100% in 2001.  At December 31, 2001 JBHT also employed approximately 3,090

office employees and 1,000 mechanics. 

No employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.

REVENUE EQUIPMENT

At December 31, 2001, JBHT owned or leased approximately

10,770 company tractors, 25,580 trailers and 18,740 containers.  JBHT believes that modern, late-model, clean

equipment differentiates quality customer service, increases equipment

utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime.  The Company generally operates with newer

revenue equipment in the JBT segment, with the age of tractors and trailers

approximating 1.5 years and 2 years, respectively, at December 31, 2001.  Slightly older equipment and tractors

designed for local and regional operations are typically utilized in the

JBI  and DCS segments.  Specially designed high-cube containers

which can be separated from the chassis and double-stacked on rail cars are

also operated by JBI.  The average age

of JBI tractors and containers at December 31, 2001 was approximately 3.5 years

and 6.5 years, respectively.  The JBI

segment commenced receiving brand new containers and reconditioned chassis in

late 2001 and plans to receive approximately 6,000 new containers during

2002.  The composition of the dedicated

contract fleet varies with specific customer service requirements.  All JBHT revenue equipment is maintained in

accordance with a specific maintenance program primarily based on age and/or

miles traveled.

COMPETITION

JBHT is one of the largest publicly held truckload carriers

in the United States. It competes primarily with other irregular route,

truckload common carriers. Less-than-truckload common carriers and private

carriers generally provide limited competition for truckload carriers. JBHT and

its associated companies are one of a few carriers offering nationwide

logistics management and dedicated revenue equipment services. Although a

number of carriers may provide competition on a regional basis, only a limited

number of companies represent competition in all markets. The extensive rail

network developed in conjunction with the various railroads also allows the

Company the opportunity to differentiate its services in the marketplace.


REGULATION

The Company’s operations as a for-hire carrier are subject to

regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier

Safety Administration (FMCSA) and by various Canadian provinces.  Entry controlled barriers were substantially

removed as a result of federal deregulation statutes such as the Interstate

Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA).   The FMCSA continues to enforce safety regulations and has

proposed new rules  which, if approved

in their present form, would limit driver’s hours of service.  President Bush is considering implementation

of provisions of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which may

result in increased competition between U.S. and Mexican carriers for truckload

services moving between these  two

countries.  The Clean Air Act of 1990

established tighter pollution standards for emissions from automobiles and

trucks.  These new standards were

effective on a phased in basis beginning with model year 1994.  Under the current rules, additional

standards are effective in October of 2002. 

The impact of these new rules on the Company has not yet been

determined.  The Company believes it has

responded effectively to the marketplace changes caused by increased domestic

competition and that it can effectively respond to any foreseeable changes in

FMCSA regulations or NAFTA implementation.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

The Company’s corporate headquarters are in Lowell, Arkansas.

A 150,000-square-foot building was constructed and occupied in September

1990.  The Company also utilizes its

former corporate building as general offices. 

In 1999, a new 20,000 square foot building was constructed and occupied

near the corporate headquarters.  A

portion of this leased facility serves as a backup data center and provides

disaster recovery support services. An additional 20,000 square foot building

consisting of general office space for Corporate employees was completed and

occupied in 2000. This building is located next to the data center building and

is a leased facility.

Principal outside facilities consist primarily of general

offices which support operational, safety and maintenance functions.  In addition to the principal facilities

listed below, the Company leases numerous small offices and trailer parking

yards in various locations throughout the county to support customer trailing

equipment pool commitments.

A summary of the

Company’s principal facilities follows:

ITEM 3.   LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

The Company is involved in certain claims and pending

litigation arising from the normal conduct of business.  Based on the present knowledge of the facts

and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes the

resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect

on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT’S

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS

This report contains

statements that may be considered to be forward-looking or predictions

concerning future operations or events. 

Such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, subject to

risks and should be viewed with caution. 

These statements are based on management’s belief or interpretation of

information currently available. 

Shareholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual results

and future events may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as

a result of many factors.  Among all the

factors and events that are not within the Company’s control and could have a

material impact on future operating results include:  general economic conditions, terrorists attacks or actions, acts

of war, cost and availability of diesel fuel, adverse weather conditions,

competitive rate fluctuations, availability of drivers, revenue equipment

resale or trade values and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to

perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment trade-in

values.  Current and future changes in

fuel prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly

earnings.  The above is not an

all-inclusive list.  Financial and

operating results of the Company may fluctuate as a result of these and other

risk factors or events as described from time to time in Company filings with

the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking

statement to the extent it becomes aware that it will not be achieved for any

reason.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s

financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring

certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known

with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared.

The preparation of

financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting

principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect:

•

the amounts reported for assets and liabilities;

•

the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at

the date of the financial statements; and

•

the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during

the reporting period.

Therefore, the reported

amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated

disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily

affected by these estimates.  Management

evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience,

consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the

particular circumstances.  Nevertheless,

actual results may differ significantly from estimates.  Any effects on business, financial position

or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are

recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become

known.

In preparing financial

statements and related disclosures, management must use estimates in

determining the economic useful lives of assets, provisions for uncollectible

accounts receivable, exposures under self-insurance plans and various other

recorded or disclosed amounts.  However,

management believes that certain accounting policies are of more significance

in the financial statement preparation process than others and are discussed

below.  To the extent that actual

outcomes differ from estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause

management to revise estimates, earnings will be affected.

Workers’

Compensation and Accident Costs

The Company purchases

insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries

(workers’ compensation), vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo

claims.  Most insurance arrangements

include a level of self insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim,

but provide an umbrella policy to limit the Company’s exposure to catastrophic

claim costs that are completely insured. 

The amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain

measurement dates and policy expiration dates. 

The Company’s current insurance coverage specifies that the first $5,000

of any claim is self insured and that the self insured limit on certain claims

was up to $2 million in 2001 and decreased to $1.5 million effective January 1,

2002, which is prefunded with its insurance carrier.  The Company is substantially self insured for loss of and damage

to its owned and leased revenue equipment. 

Company safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives

from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated ultimate cost

of each claim.  At December 31, 2001,

the Company had approximately $14 million of estimated net claims payable.  In addition, the Company is required to pay

certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had a prepaid insurance asset of

approximately $38 million.


During the fourth quarter

of 2001, the Company modified its method of estimating and recording its

ultimate cost related to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims, which

will result in a more accurate estimate of the Company’s ultimate loss from

claims.  The Company began applying loss

development factors to its accident and workers’ compensation claims history.  This new method results in a more accurate

estimate of the Company’s ultimate loss from claims than its prior method.  This new method resulted in a restatement of

the following balances at December 31, 1998: 

a $10.2 million decrease in retained earnings, a $16.3 million increase

in claims payable and a $6.1 million increase in deferred tax assets.  These adjustments had no material impact on

year 2000 and 1999 consolidated earnings.

Revenue

Equipment

The Company operates a significant number of tractors,

trailers and containers in connection with its business.  This equipment may be purchased or acquired

under capital or operating leases.  In

addition, revenue equipment may be rented from third parties and various

railroads under short-term rental arrangements.  Revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the

straight-line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated

salvage or trade-in value.  Equipment

acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of

the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straight-line method over the

lease term or the estimated useful life, which ever is shorter.

The Company has an agreement with its primary tractor

supplier for guaranteed residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment

acquired since 1999.  The Company has

utilized these values in accounting for purchased and leased tractors.  If the supplier was unable to perform under

the terms of such agreements, it could have a material negative impact on the

Company’s financial results.

Revenue

Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue based on the relative transit

time of the freight transported. 

Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the

customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based

on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been

completed at the end of the reporting period.

Segments

The Company operated three segments during the calendar year

2001.  Segments included Truck (JBT),

Intermodal (JBI) and Dedicated Contract Services (DCS).  JBT business included full truck-load,

dry-van freight which is primarily transported utilizing company-owned or

controlled revenue equipment.  Freight

in the JBT segment is typically transported over roads and highways and no portion

of a movement involves railroads.  The

JBI segment includes freight which is transported by rail over at least a

portion of the movement.  JBI freight

may also include certain repositioning truck loads which are moved by JBI

equipment or third-party carriers, in circumstances where the movement directs

JBI equipment back toward intermodal operations.  DCS segment business usually includes company-owned revenue

equipment and employee drivers who are assigned to a specific customer, traffic

lane or service.  DCS operations most

frequently involve formal, written long-term agreements which govern services

performed and applicable rates.

Prior to July 1, 2000, the Logistics business segment (JBL)

primarily consisted of J.B. Hunt Logistics, a wholly-owned subsidiary which

provided a wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management

services.  Such services included

experienced professional managers, information and freight optimization

technology and the actual design or redesign of freight system solutions.  JBL utilized JBT, JBI or DCS owned or

controlled assets and employees, or third-party carriers, or a combination to

meet service requirements.  JBL services

were typically provided in accordance with written long-term agreements.  Effective July 1, 2000, JBL exchanged its

ownership in substantially all of its assets for an initial membership interest

in TPC.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2001 Compared With 2000

Operating Segments

For Years Ended December 31

(in millions of dollars)

*As of December 31, 2000, TPC

qualified as a reportable business segment for financial reporting purposes.

However, the logistics segment (JBL) information for 2001 shown above excludes

TPC from its inception in July 2000. 

TPC is accounted for on the equity method and does not qualify as a

reporting segment in 2001.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in

conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and

related footnotes appearing in this annual report.

Overview

of 2001

Financial and operating results for the year 2001 were

impacted by a number of significant items. 

General economic conditions in the transportation industry were soft

during the majority of the year and fuel costs varied dramatically, sometimes

changing more than 10% from one month to the next.  However, overall fuel costs for 2001 were down from prior

year.  Consolidated operating revenues

for 2001 decreased approximately 3% from 2000. 

Excluding the JBL operations, which were contributed to TPC as of July

1, 2000, revenue growth for the remaining business segments was approximately

6%.  The growth in the remaining

segments is attributable to expansion of the Company’s operating fleet of

tractors from an average of 10,055 in 2000 to 10,710 in 2001 an average

increase of 655 tractors or 6.5%.  While

fuel costs and related fuel surcharge revenues varied significantly during

2001, the net change in fuel surcharge revenue had less than a 1% impact on

revenue between 2001 and 2000.

JBT segment revenue totaled $828.6 million in 2001, down 1%

from 2000.  This decline was due in part

to the softer economy that created a reduced demand for freight.  The Company began focusing on improving the

operating ratio through cost management initiatives rather than JBT fleet

growth.  The Company has no plans to

grow the JBT fleet until such time that a reasonable operating income has been

achieved warranting the additional investment of capital.  JBT tractor count, including independent

contractors (I/C’s) declined nearly 3% during 2001 and tractor utilization was

also down approximately 3%.  However,

revenue per loaded mile increased 3.9%, excluding fuel surcharges, reflecting

freight mix changes and pure rate increases,. 

The Truck segment generated operating income of $8.7 million in 2001,

compared with a loss of $7.1 million in 2000. 

As a result of a new initiative commenced in late 2000, the number of

I/C’s in JBT grew to 337 in 2001, from 16 at the end of 2000.  Continued volatility in the earnings power

of the Truck unit is likely to prevail until supply and demand factors in the

truckload industry improve.  Additional

improvement is significantly dependent upon increases in the availability of

freight.

JBI segment business was reasonably strong during 2001 and

grew 9% to $740.5 million from $681.1 million in 2000.  The Intermodal segment held its tractor

count essentially flat at 910 during 2001. Unlike the other segments, growth of

JBI is not easily tracked by number of tractors, as JBI can utilize outside

dray carriers and the other JBHT business units to support load and revenue

growth.  The increase in revenue can be

attributed to a 5% increase in the number of loads from 2000 to 2001 coupled

with a .5% increase in revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharges.  As a result of revenue growth and

utilization of containers, JBI operating income climbed 13% in 2001 to $42.1

million from $36.7 million in 2000.


DCS segment revenue grew 15% during 2001, to $548.7 million

from $478.6 million in 2000.  This

growth rate was down significantly from recent years due to:  1) soft economic conditions which made

companies more apprehensive about changing or outsourcing their transportation

needs, and;  2) the Company’s

unwillingness to reduce rates to increase market share.  The DCS segment tractor fleet grew by 15%

during 2001, but revenue growth was limited by idle tractors throughout most of

the year.  DCS generated $17.4 million

of operating income in 2001, compared with $28.4 million in 2000.  The lower margin and reduced operating

income was primarily a result of idle tractors and a higher proportionate

amount of shared trailer pool and corporate support costs being assigned to the

business, as a result of improving the tracking of trailer usage and the

increased internal transfer price, which is charged by JBT and JBI when DCS

utilizes their assigned trailers.  Cost

control and close analysis of individual fleet profitability remains a DCS

objective.  As in the case of Truck, DCS

has no fleet growth planned for 2002.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company’s share of

TPC’s results of operations totaled a loss of $1.9 million, compared with

earnings of $440,000 for the six month period ended December 31, 2000.  TPC’s operating loss in 2001 was primarily

due to start up expenses.  JBHT’s

financial exposure is limited to its approximate $6.4 million investment in TPC

as the Company has not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of

TPC’s financial obligations.

The following table sets

forth items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of

operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as

compared with the prior year.

Consolidated Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses

in 2001 declined 3.3% from 2000, decreasing in relative proportion to operating

revenues.  The Company’s operating ratio

(operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues) improved

slightly to 96.6% in 2001 from 97.1% in 2000. 

As previously mentioned, the JBL segment was contributed to TPC

effective July 1, 2000.  This

approximate 10% reduction in consolidated operating revenues was the primary

factor in reduced rents and purchased transportation expense.  The JBI segment relied solely on JBT and

third party carriers for transportation services and accordingly, purchased

transportation costs as a percent of revenue were significantly higher than the

other segments.  The decline in fuel and

fuel tax expense was primarily due to significantly lower fuel cost per gallon

in late 2001.  The increase in 2001 operating

supplies and expenses reflected higher tractor and trailing equipment

maintenance and tire costs.  Insurance

and claims costs reflected higher collision rates in JBT during 2001.  The significant decline in general and

administrative expenses was due to an approximate $5.5 million gain on the sale

of a group of trailers, which closed in March of 2001.  Gains on revenue equipment dispositions are

included in this expense classification and totaled a net gain of $4.8 million

in 2001, compared with a loss of $267,000 in 2000.


Equity in earnings (loss) of associated companies reflects

the Company’s share of operating results for TPC and for the Mexican joint

venture.  Equity in earnings amounts included

the following:

The year 2001 financial results of the

Company’s Mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying

value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of the Company’s

interests.  The Company has an agreement

in principle for a sale to the majority owner of the joint venture.  This transaction is expected to be

consummated in early 2002.  If the

transaction closes under the current terms and conditions, no material impact

on earnings is anticipated.


Compared With 1999

Operating Segments

For Years Ended December 31

(in millions of dollars)

*As of December 31, 2000, TPC

qualified as a reportable business segment for financial reporting purposes.

However, the logistics segment information shown above excludes TPC from its

inception in July 2000.  TPC is

accounted for on the equity method.

Overview of 2000

Financial and operating results for the year 2000 were

impacted by a number of significant items. 

Consolidated operating revenues for 2000 increased 6% over 1999.  Excluding the JBL operations, which were

contributed to TPC as of July 1, 2000, revenue growth for the remaining segments

was approximately 15%.  The increase in

fuel surcharge revenue associated with higher costs of fuel in the current year

accounted for approximately 4% of revenue growth for these remaining segments.  Prior to January 1, 2000, the JBT and JBI

businesses had been operated and reported together as the Van business

segment.  Accordingly, 2000 was the

first full year that certain JBT and JBI identifiable information was

available.

JBT segment revenue increased 9%, to $833.8 million in 2000,

from $763.2 million, in 1999.  Revenue

per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 3.4% in 2000.  The JBT company owned/leased tractor fleet

totaled 5,850 at December 31, 2000.  A

new initiative to utilize independent contractors, who own their tractors was

commenced in late 2000.  The JBT segment

had operating arrangements with 16 independent contractors at December 31,

2000.  The JBT segment incurred an

operating loss of $7.1 million in 2000. 

Since the JBT and JBI segments were operated in combined fashion during

1999, no comparative operating results were available.  A portion of the year 2000 JBT operating

loss was due to certain costs incurred to separate the JBT and JBI business

units.


The JBI segment business grew 5%, to $681.1 million in 2000,

from $651.6 million in 1999.  Intermodal

revenue per loaded mile in 2000, exclusive of fuel surcharges, was essentially

flat compared with 1999.  The increase

in revenue was primarily due to a 5% increase in revenue per load over 1999 and

the JBI tractor fleet totaled 908 at December 31, 2000.  The intermodal segment generated operating

income of $36.7 million in 2000.  A

comparable amount for 1999 is not available.

During 2000, DCS segment revenue grew 49%, to $478.6 million,

from $320.2 million in 1999.  A portion

of the DCS segment revenue growth was due to transfers of equipment and drivers

from the JBT business segment.  The DCS

tractor fleet increased 15% to total 3,890 at December 31, 2000.  DCS operating income was $28.4 million in

2000, compared with $24.1 million in 1999. 

The lower margin on the DCS segment business in 2000 was primarily due

to a higher proportionate share of corporate support costs being assigned to

the business.

The JBL business was contributed to TPC effective July 1,

2000.  JBL generated $230 million of

revenue and $8.1 million of operating income between January 1, 2000 and June

30, 2000.  The Company’s share of TPC’s

results of operations was reported on a one-line, non-operating item on the

Consolidated Statements of Earnings and totaled $440,000 in 2000.  No gain or loss was recognized upon

formation and contribution of JBL segment assets to TPC.

The following table sets

forth items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of

operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as

compared with the prior year.

Consolidated

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses in 2000 increased 6.4% over 1999, in

relative proportion to the increase in operating revenues.  The Company’s operating ratio (operating

expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues) increased to 97.1% in

2000 from 96.4% in 1999.  As previously

mentioned the JBL segment was contributed to TPC effective July 1, 2000.  This change reduced the rate of revenue

growth and was the primary factor in the reduction of rents and purchased

transportation expense as a percent of revenue in 2000.  The significant increase in fuel and fuel

tax expense was driven by an approximate 35% higher cost per gallon and

slightly lower fuel miles per gallon in 2000. 

Fuel surcharges, which were initiated in late 1999, recovered

approximately 90% of higher fuel costs during 2000.  The more than 20% increase in operating taxes and licenses

expense was due to the 13% increase of the tractor fleet and higher state base

plate license cost per tractor in 2000. 

The decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily a

result of unusually high bad debt expense in 1999 and system support charges

paid by TPC in 2000.  Those payments to

the Company from TPC reduced general and administrative expenses.  Gain and loss on equipment dispositions are

also included in this classification and totaled a loss of $267,000 and

$849,000 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 

The lower year 2000 interest expense reflected the reduction of average

debt balances, partly due to the use of the proceeds from sale and leaseback

transactions to pay outstanding debt balances.


Equity in earnings of associated companies reflects the

Company’s share of operating results for TPC and for the Mexican joint

venture.  Equity in earnings amounts

include the following:

LIQUIDITY AND

CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow

The Company generates significant amounts of cash from

operating activities.  Net cash provided

by operating activities increased to $172 million in 2001 compared to $125

million in 2000, and $136 million in 1999. 

The increase from 2000 to 2001 was mainly due to increases in prepaid

lease expense related to a significant upfront payment for an operating lease

in late 2000.  The decrease in cash

provided by operations in 2000 versus 1999 is due to the items mentioned above

and the Company’s decision to acquire revenue equipment through capital and

operating leases rather than purchase.

Net cash used in investing activities was $24 million in

2001, $100 million in 2000 and $19 million in 1999.  The primary use of funds for investing activities was the

acquisition of new revenue equipment. 

Net invested cash was reduced in 2001, primarily due to the utilization

of operating and capital leases.  Net

invested cash in 1999 was reduced by proceeds from a sale and leaseback of

approximately $175 million of trailing equipment.

Cash used in financing

activities was $103 million in 2001, $32 million in 2000 and $113 million in

1999.  The increase in 2001 is due

primarily to net repayments of commercial paper.  The decrease in 2000 when compared to 1999 is due to the use of

proceeds received from the sale leaseback transaction in 1999 to reduce the

outstanding commercial paper balance at December 31, 1999.

Liquidity

The Company’s 

continued growth is primarily contingent upon it’s ability to

provide  funds in order to obtain

revenue equipment.  Various financing

arrangements, including purchases, capital leases and operating leases are

utilized from time to time to fund revenue equipment additions.  A tractor capital lease program was

initiated in July of 2000 and the majority of tractor acquisitions through

September 2001 were under this program. 

Tractor additions since October of 2001 have been purchased with excess

cash flow.   The majority of trailing

equipment additions since October of 2000 have been under operating lease

programs.  Effective in November of

2001, the JBI business unit began to take delivery of the first of 6,000 new

containers.  The Company expects to

purchase these containers and the majority of tractor acquisitions during 2002

using funds provided from operations and short-term debt.

Under the terms of its

various financing and leasing agreements, the Company is required to maintain

certain financial covenants including leverage tests, minimum tangible net

worth levels and other financial ratios. 

The Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants at

December 31, 2001.  One operating lease

arrangement requires the Company to maintain an investment grade credit rating

for the Company’s Senior unsecured debt. 

The Company currently is rated BBB by Standard & Poors and Baa3 by

Moody’s.  A credit rating downgrade to

BB+ by Standard & Poors or to Ba1 by Moody’s, while not expected by the

Company, could result in an adjustment to the rental payments under the

obligation.  Management estimates that

such a credit downgrade could result in a $1.9 million annual increase in the

associated rental payments.

Contractual Cash Obligations

Financing Commitments

As of December 31, 2001

(000)

In January of 2001,

Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the ratings of the Company’s senior

unsecured debt to Baa3 from Baa2 and its commercial paper to Prime-3 from Prime-2.  The Company is authorized to borrow up to

$165 million under its current short-term revolving line of credit, which

matures November 13, 2002.  There was no

balance


outstanding on the revolving line of credit at December 31, 2001.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had

committed to purchase approximately $128 million of revenue and service

equipment, net of proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances.  Additional capital spending for new revenue

equipment is anticipated during 2002. 

However, funding for such expenditures is expected to come from cash

generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities.  The Company had approximately $165 million

of unused borrowing capacity at December 31, 2001 under its committed revolving

line of credit.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July

2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial

Accounting Standards No. 141 “Business Combinations” (FAS 141) and Statement of

Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(FAS 142). FAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30,

2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under FAS 142, goodwill and

intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are

reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for

impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite

lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives (but with no

maximum life). The amortization provisions of FAS 142 apply to goodwill and

intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and

intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the Company is required to adopt

FAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. . The Company has no negative goodwill as

contemplated under Statements 141 and 142 related to its equity method

investments.  The adoption of this new

accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the

Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In July

2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”. 

Statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability

for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a

corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.

Statement 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.  The Company is currently assessing the

impact of Statements 143 on its consolidated financial condition and results of

operations.

In

August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of

Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or

Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144), which supersedes both Statement of

Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of

Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” (FAS 121) and

the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting

the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a

Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and

Transactions” (Opinion 30), for the disposal of a segment of a business (as

previously defined in that Opinion). FAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions

in FAS 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets

held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also

resolving significant implementation issues associated with FAS 121. For

example, FAS 144 provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as

part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when

a long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a

long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. FAS 144 retains

the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in

the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of

an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike FAS 121, an impairment

assessment under FAS 144 will never result in a write-down of goodwill. Rather,

goodwill is evaluated for impairment under FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and

Other Intangible Assets.”

The

Company is required to adopt FAS 144 no later than its first fiscal year

beginning after December 15, 2001. Management does not expect the adoption

of FAS 144 for long-lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the

Company’s financial statements because the impairment assessment under FAS 144

is largely unchanged from FAS 121. The provisions of this statement for assets

held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied

prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities

and therefore, will depend on future actions initiated by management. As a

result, management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of FAS

144 will have on the Company’s financial statements with respect to future

disposal decisions.

ITEM 7a.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company’s earnings are affected

by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of its issuance of short-term

debt. The Company from time to time utilizes interest rate swaps to mitigate

the effects of interest rate changes; 

none were


outstanding at

December 31, 2001.  Risk can be

estimated by  measuring the impact of a

near-term adverse movement of 10% in short-term market interest rates.  If short-term market interest rates average

10% more during the next twelve months, there would be no material adverse

impact on the Company’s results of operations based on variable rate debt

outstanding at December 31, 2001.  At

December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate long-term

obligations approximated carrying value.

Although the Company conducts

business in foreign countries, international operations are not material to the

Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash

flows.  Additionally, foreign currency

transaction gains and losses were not material to the Company’s results of

operations for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Accordingly, the Company is not currently subject to material

foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate

movements of foreign currencies would have on the Company’s future costs or on

future cash flows it would receive from its foreign investment.  To date, the Company has not entered into

any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial

instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency

exchange rates.


ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


Independent Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J. B.

Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and

2000, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity

and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,

2001.  These consolidated financial

statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion

on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally

accepted in the United States of America. 

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain

reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting

the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the

accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well

as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a

reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of J. B. Hunt

Transport Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and

the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in

the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting

principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As more fully described in Note 12, retained earnings at December 31,

1998,  has been restated to reflect an

increase in insurance claims payable.

and 1999

(1)      Summary

of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Description of Business

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., together with its wholly-owned

subsidiaries (“Company”), is a diversified transportation services company

operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation and

various state regulatory agencies.

As of December 31, 2001 the Company has three distinct operating

segments: Truck; Intermodal; and Dedicated Contract Services.  For years prior, the Company had four

operating segments:  Truck; Intermodal;

Dedicated Contract Services; and Logistics. 

See note 10.

(b)

Principles of Consolidation and Critical Accounting

Policies

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements

of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been

elimi­nated in consolidation.

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are

based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and

contained within this report.  Certain

amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related

disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with

respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the

time the financial statements are prepared. 

Therefore, the reported amount of our assets and liabilities, revenues

and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and

obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing

basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other

methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ

significantly from our estimates.

However, we believe that certain accounting policies are of more

significance in our financial statement preparation process than others

including determining the economic useful lives of our assets, provisions for

uncollectible accounts receivable, exposures under our self-insurance plans and

various other recorded or disclosed amounts. 

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or

additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our

earnings will be affected.

(continued)


(c)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all

highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or

less to be cash equivalents.

(d)

Tires in Service

The Company capitalizes tires placed in service on new revenue

equipment as a part of the equipment cost. 

Replacement tires and costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time

the tires are placed in service.

(e)

Property and Equipment

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the

straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 10 years for

revenue and service equipment, 10 to 40 years for structures and improvements,

and 3 to 10 years for furniture and office equipment.

Property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present

value of minimum lease payments; and amortized over the straight-line method

over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.

(f)

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue based on relative transit time in each

reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.

(g)

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability

method.  Deferred tax assets and

liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to

differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets

and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax

credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax

assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply

to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are

expected to be recovered or settled. 

The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax

rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(continued)


(i)

Credit Risk

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to

concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect

to trade receivables are limited due to the Company’s large number of customers

and the diverse range of industries which they represent.  As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the

Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk.

(j)

Foreign Currency Translation

Local currencies are generally considered the functional currencies

outside the United States.  Assets and

liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates for operations in local

currency environments.  Income and

expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the

year.

Foreign currency translation adjustments, which reflect foreign

currency exchange rate changes applicable to the net assets of the Mexican

operations have been recorded as a separate item of accumulated other

comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity for the years ended December 31,

2001 and 2000.

(k)

Stock Based Compensation

The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and, as permitted under SFAS No. 123,

applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations

in accounting for compensation costs for its stock option plans.  Accordingly, compensation expense is

recognized on the date of grant only if the current market price of the

underlying common stock at date of grant exceeds the exercise price.

(l)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets

to be Disposed of

The Company continually evaluates the carrying value of its assets for

events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value may

not be recoverable.  Recoverability of

assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount

of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the

asset.  If such assets are considered to

be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which

the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the

lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

(continued)


(m)

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and foreign currency

translation adjustments and is presented in the consolidated statements of

stockholders’ equity.

(n)

Claims Accruals

Claims payable represent accruals for the uninsured portion of pending

accident liability, workers’ compensation, physical damage and cargo

damage.  These accruals are estimated

based on management’s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual

claims and an estimate of future claims development based on the Company’s past

claims experience.  Claims payable were

restated as of December 31, 1998 (See Note 12).

The Company’s 2001 insurance coverage specifies that the first $5,000

of any claim is self insured and that the self insured limit on certain claims

was $1 million which is prefunded with its insurance carrier.  The Company is substantially self insured

for loss of and damage to its owned and leased revenue equipment.

(2)       Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of (in thousands):

(continued)


The Company is authorized to issue up to $165 million under its current

revolving line of credit.  This line of

credit is supported by a credit agreement, with a group of banks, which expires

November 13, 2002.  No balances were

outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2001.  The 7.80% senior subordinated notes are

payable in five equal annual installments, the first of which was due on

October 30, 2000.

Under the terms of the credit agreements and the note agreements, the

Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage

tests, minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance with all of

the financial covenants at December 31, 2001.

Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2001 consist of

the third installment of the 7.80% senior subordinated notes.  The aggregate annual maturities of long-term

debt for each of the four years ending December 31 are as follows (in

thousands):  2002, $10,000; 2003,

$108,260; 2004, $105,000; and 2005, $0.

(3)       Capital Stock

The Company maintains a Management Incentive Plan (“Plan”) that

provides various vehicles to compensate key employees with Company common stock

or common stock equivalents.  Under the

original Plan, the Company was authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than

5,000,000 shares.  During 1998 and again

in 2000, the stockholders of the Company amended the Plan whereby the Company

is now authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than 8,500,000 shares.  At December 31, 2001 there were

approximately 1,573,000 shares available for grant under the Plan.  The Company has utilized three such vehicles

to award stock or grant options to purchase the Company’s common stock:

restricted stock awards, restricted options and nonstatutory stock options.

Restricted stock awards are granted to key employees subject to

restrictions regarding transferability and assignment.  Shares of Company common stock are issued to

the key employees and held by the Company until each employee becomes vested in

the award.  Vesting of the awards

generally occurs over a four-year period of time from the award date.  Termination of the employee for any reason

other than death, disability or certain cases of retirement causes the unvested

portion of the award to be forfeited.

The Plan provides that nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key

employees for the purchase of Company common stock for 100% of the fair market

value of the common stock at the grant date. 

The options generally vest over a ten-year period and are forfeited if

the employee

(continued)


terminates for any reason.  The

Company amended certain vested options related to employees of its logistics

segment, extending the exercise period after termination.  This resulted in a remeasurement of these

options and accordingly $110,000 was charged to compensation expense in 2000.

Compensation expense (benefit) under the Plan for restricted stock

awards is charged to earnings over the vesting period and amounted to

approximately ($5,400) for the year ended December 31, 1999.  There have been no restricted stock awards

in 2001 and 2000.

A summary of the restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase

Company common stock follows:

During 1995, the Board of Directors established a nonqualified stock

option plan to provide performance based compensation to the Chairman of the

Board (Chairman’s Plan).  The Chairman’s

Plan allows the Chairman the option to purchase up to 2.5 million shares of the

Company’s common stock at a price of $17.63 per share.  These options vested after five years.  Under the original Chairman’s Plan the

options must be exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised

options will terminate.  During 2000,

the stockholders of the Company amended

(continued)


the Chairman’s Plan whereby the exercise period was extended to be

within two years of vesting of which 1.5 million shares were exercised during

the year ended December 31, 2001. 

The number of options outstanding for the Chairman’s Plan was 1 million

at December 31, 2001.

Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at

the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net

earnings would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below.

Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted since December 31,

1995.  Therefore, the full impact of

calculating compensation costs for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not

reflected in the pro forma net earnings amounts presented above because

compensation cost is reflected over the options’ vesting periods of 5 to 10

years and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1996 is not

considered.

The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted

during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $10.82, $9.07 and $4.13, respectively, on the

date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following

weighted-average assumptions: 2001 — expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility

of 59.9%, risk-free interest rate of 4.7%, and an expected life of 6.2 years;

2000 — expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 52.4%, risk-free interest

rate of 5.2%, and an expected life of 6.6 years; 1999 — expected dividend yield

1.2%, volatility of 51.6%, risk-free interest rate of 6.5%, and an expected

life of 7.3 years.

The following table summarizes information about stock options

outstanding at December 31, 2001:

(4)       Income Taxes

Total income tax (income)

expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was allocated as

follows (in thousands):

(Payable) refundable income taxes at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were

$(3,989,000) and $3,133,000, respectively. 

These amounts have been included in other current liabilities and assets

on the balance sheet, respectively.

Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to earnings before income

taxes consists of (in thousands):

Income tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes

differed from the amounts computed using the statutory federal tax rate of 35%

for the following reasons (in thousands):

(continued)


The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant

portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December

31, 2001 and 2000 are presented below (in thousands):

(continued)


The Company believes its history of profitability and taxable income,

the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and its utilization of tax planning

sufficiently supports the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a

valuation allowance as all deferred tax benefits are more likely than not to be

realized.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had general business tax credit

carryforwards of approximately $3,827,000 expiring from the year 2007 to 2009,

and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with no expiration of

approximately $8,354,000.

(5)       Employee Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a defined contribution employee retirement plan,

which includes a 401(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to

participate.  The Company matches a

specified percentage of employee contributions, subject to certain

limitations.  For the years ended

December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, total Company contributions to the plan,

including matching 401(k) contributions, were $7,555,000, $6,553,000 and

$7,348,000, respectively.

(6)       Fair Value of Significant Financial

Instruments

(a)

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and

Trade Accounts Payable

The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short

maturity of these instruments.

(b)

Long-Term Debt

The fair value of the fixed rate debt is presented as the present value

of future cash flows discounted using the Company’s current borrowing rate for

notes of comparable maturity.  The

calculation arrives at a theoretical amount the Company would pay a

creditworthy third party to assume its fixed rate obligations and not the

termination value of these obligations. Consistent with market practices, such

termination values may include various prepayment and termination fees that the

Company would contractually be required to pay if it retired the debt early.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are

summarized as follows (in thousands):

(continued)


(7)       Related Party Transactions

The Company advances premiums on life insurance policies on the lives

of the Company’s principal stockholder and his wife.  All premiums paid by the Company, along with accrued interest

thereon, are reimbursable from a trust which is the owner and beneficiary of

the policy.  The Company has a guarantee

from the stockholder for the amount of premiums paid by the Company together

with interest at the rate of 5% per annum until June of 2000.  In July of 2000 the Board of Directors

approved an adjustment to the interest rate to be the average borrowing rate of

the Company when additional advances were made.  The interest rate changed to 7.42% in August 2001.  The amounts reimbursable to the Company

amount to approximately $9,049,000 and $8,002,000 at December 31, 2001 and

2000, respectively, and are included in other assets in the accompanying

consolidated balance sheets.  See also

note 9 for disclosure of transactions with an associated company.

(8)       Commitments and Contingencies

During 1999, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback transaction

for a portion of its container fleet. 

Containers having a net book value of approximately $175,000,000 were

sold to third party leasing companies at approximate net book value.  A gain on the transaction has been deferred

and will be amortized to income in relation to rent expense recognized under

the leases.  The containers are being

leased back under operating leases over terms of four to ten years.  The Company also leases trailing equipment,

terminal facilities, shuttle yards and computer equipment under operating

leases having various terms.  Under the

terms of certain lease agreements, the Company is required to maintain certain

covenants including minimum credit ratings. 

The Company was in compliance with this requirement at December 31,

2001.

During 2001 the Company entered into various capital lease agreements

to lease revenue equipment.  These

capital leases are secured by revenue equipment with a net book value at

December 31, 2001 of approximately $168,000,000 and contain certain guarantees

of residual value at the end of the lease terms with fixed price purchase

options.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases

(with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) and future

minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 2001 are:

(continued)


At December 31, 2001 and 2000 gross property and equipment recorded

under capital leases was $194,256,000 and $97,553,000, respectively.  Total rent expense was $98,783,000 in 2001,

$87,545,000 in 2000, and $39,862,000 in 1999, respectively.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had

committed to purchase approximately $128,000,000 of revenue and service

equipment net of expected proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances.  The Company is involved in certain claims

and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business.  Based on the present knowledge of the facts

and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes the

resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse

effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

(9)       Investment in Affiliated Company

In March 2000, the Company, along with four other motor carriers,

announced the intent to contribute all of its non-asset based logistics

business into a recently formed joint venture, Transplace, Inc. (TPC).  TPC is an internet-based global transportation

logistics company.  TPC commenced

operations effective July 1, 2000.  The

Company contributed all of its logistics segment business and all related

intangible assets, plus $5.0 million of cash, in exchange for an approximate

27% initial membership interest in TPC. 

The Company accounts for its approximate 27% interest in TPC utilizing

the equity method of accounting.  No

gain or loss was recognized

(continued)


upon formation and contribution of logistics segment assets to

TPC.  The excess of the Company’s share

of TPC’s net assets over its cost basis is being amortized over 20 years on a

straight-line method.  Equity in

earnings of TPC was a loss of $1,919,000 in 2001.

The Company provided various services to TPC under a shared service

agreement, the terms of which expired on December 31, 2001.  The services included the following:  payroll and benefits; accounting; computer

system maintenance; office facilities; and telecommunications.  The fees from these services approximated

$6,483,000 and $2,971,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and were recorded in

the consolidated statement of earnings as reimbursements of salaries, wages and

employee benefits and general and administrative expenses.

The Company earned revenues of $69,696,000 and $43,500,000 from TPC in

providing transportation services during 2001 and in the last six months of

2000, respectively.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, trade accounts receivable included

$4,198,000 and $1,148,000, respectively, due from TPC for freight and fees

related to the shared service agreement.

For the year ending December 31, 2001, the Company had incurred

approximately $32,649,000 in purchased transportation expense as a result of

TPC providing transportation services.

(10)     Segment Information

The Company had three reportable business segments during 2001, Truck

(JBT), Intermodal (JBI), and Dedicated Contract Services (DCS).  For years prior, the Company had four

reportable business segments, JBT, JBI, DCS and Logistics.  JBT business includes full truck-load,

dry-van freight which is typically transported utilizing company-owned or

controlled revenue equipment.  This freight

is typically transported over roads and highways and does not move by rail.  The JBI segment includes freight which is

transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement and also

includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI equipment or

third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to direct JBI

equipment back toward intermodal operations. 

The JBT and JBI business segments were operated in combined fashion

(formally reported as Van/Intermodal in prior periods) and limited identifiable

comparative information is available for JBT and JBI prior to January 1,

2000.  Accordingly, the Company has

provided comparable segment information for the year ended December 31, 2001

based on the prior segmentation, which included JBT and JBI as the former

segment, “Van/Intermodal”.

DCS segment business typically includes company-owned revenue equipment

and employee drivers which are assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane or

service.  DCS operations usually include

formal, written long-term agreements or contracts which govern services

performed and applicable rates.

(continued)


Prior to July 1, 2000, the Logistics business segment primarily

consisted of J. B. Hunt Logistics (JBL) a wholly-owned subsidiary which

provided a wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management

services.  Such services included

experienced professional managers, information and optimization technology and

the actual design or redesign of freight system solutions.  JBL utilized JBT, JBI or DCS owned or controlled

assets and employees, or third-party carriers, or a combination to meet

customer service requirements.  JBL

services typically were provided in accordance with written long-term

agreements.  As discussed in Note 9, the

Company exchanged its ownership in JBL for an initial membership interest in

TPC.  Effective July 1, 2000, the

Company began accounting for its ownership in TPC utilizing the equity method

of accounting.  As of December 31, 2000,

TPC qualifies as a reportable business segment and, accordingly, the Logistics

segment information shown below includes both JBL and TPC.  Information for TPC included in the

following tables is the entity’s results of operations without regard to the

Company’s ownership interest which is then subtracted in reconciling to the

consolidated statement of earnings.

The Company’s customers are geographically dispersed across the United

States and include many of the “Fortune 500” companies.  One customer exceeded 10% of consolidated

operating revenues in 2001 and 2000.  No

single customer exceeded 10% in 1999.  A

summary of certain segment information is presented below (in millions):

(11)     Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

Operating results by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2001 and

2000 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

(12)     Restatement of Beginning Retained Earnings

In 2001, the Company modified its method of estimating and accruing its

ultimate cost related to accident workers’ compensation, cargo and physical

damage claims in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in

the United States of America.  The

Company began applying loss development factors to its accident and workers’

compensation claims history.  This new

method results in a more accurate estimate of the Company’s ultimate loss from

claims than its prior method.

This new method resulted in a restatement of the following balances at

December 31, 1998: a decrease in retained earnings of $10.2 million, an

increase in claims payable of $16.3 million, and an increase in deferred tax

assets of $6.1 million.  This

restatement had no material impact on the 2000 and 1999 consolidated statements

of income.  Accordingly, the Company’s

consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2000 has been restated to reflect

the same adjustments to retained earnings, claims payable and deferred tax

assets.
