addition to those listed above, could impact us financially.  Our operating results may fluctuate as a
result of these and other risk factors or events as described from time to time
in our filings with the SEC.  Some of
the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from
estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements are
described under “Risk Factors” in Item 7. 
We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to the
extent we become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

We are one of the largest
full truck-load transportation and logistics companies in North America.  J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT) is
a publicly held holding company, which together with our wholly owned subsidiaries
and associated companies, provides a wide range of transportation and logistics
services to a diverse group of customers throughout the continental United
States, Canada and Mexico.  We were
incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1961, and have been a publicly held
company since our initial public offering in 1983.  Our service offerings include transportation of full truck-load,
containerizable freight, which we directly transport utilizing our
company-controlled revenue equipment and drivers.  We also manage and provide tailored, technology-driven freight
services which may employ equipment and transportation services provided by all
major North American rail carriers, an associated logistics company or by
unrelated third parties in the industry.

Our business operations
are primarily organized through three distinct, but complementary, business
segments.  These segments include full
truck-load, dry-van (JBT), intermodal (JBI) and dedicated contract services
(DCS).  In addition, we operated a
logistics business segment from 1992 until mid-2000.  Effective July 1, 2000, we, along with five other publicly
held transportation companies, contributed our logistics business to a new,
commonly owned company, Transplace, Inc. 
For the calendar year ended December 31, 2003, our consolidated revenue
totaled $2.4 billion.  Of this total,
$936 million, or 38%, was generated by our JBI business segment.  Our JBT segment generated $841 million, or
34%, of total revenue and DCS represented $671 million, or 28%.


Additional general
information about us is available from our Internet website at
www.jbhunt.com.  We make a number of
reports and other information available free of charge on our website including
our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as
earnings releases.  Our website also
contains corporate governance guidelines, codes of conduct, committee charters
for our board of directors and officer certifications of our filings with the
SEC.

Business Strategy

We seek to add value to
each of our customer’s supply chain by providing superior service at
competitive rates while reducing our customers’ costs through network density,
transportation mode conversion and dedicated fleets.  We believe that our operating strategy can add value to customers
and increase our profits and returns to shareholders.

Recent Focus

During the past three
years, we have taken significant steps to re-establish a primary focus on the
profitability of our three business segments. 
In each segment we have implemented yield management decision-making
processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they
will generate more profit.  We
continually seek to replace less-profitable freight with higher-margin freight
and lanes.  Selective pricing actions
and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been
areas of major focus.

JBT Segment

Our primary
transportation service offerings classified in this segment include full
truck-load, dry-van freight which is predominantly transported utilizing
company-controlled tractors.  We pick up
our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the
load directly to the location of the consignee.  Most of our loads are transported entirely by our company-owned
tractors and employee drivers, or  by
independent contractors (ICs) who agree to transport freight in our
trailers.  We also assign freight to be
handled by third-party motor carriers other than ICs.  Typically, in these cases, the charges for the entire movement
are billed to the customer by us and we, in turn, pay the third party for their
portion of the transportation services provided.

We operate utilizing
certain Canadian authorities, allowing us to transport freight to and from all
points in the continental United States to Quebec, British Columbia and
Ontario.  We have authorization to
operate directly in all the Canadian provinces, but to date we have served
limited points in Canada, primarily through interchange operations with
Canadian motor carriers.  We operated
our JBT and JBI (Intermodal) segments in combined fashion in periods prior to
January 1, 2000.  This combined
operation was reported as Van/Intermodal (“Van”) in prior periods.  In late 2000, we began utilizing ICs in the
JBT segment and at December 31, 2003, we had approximately 1,000 ICs
operating in the JBT segment.  JBT gross
revenue for calendar year 2003 was $841 million, compared with $827 million in
2002.  At December 31, 2003, the
JBT segment operated 4,429 company-owned tractors and employed 6,228 people,
5,300 of whom were drivers.

JBI Segment

The transportation
service offerings of our JBI segment utilize agreements with all major North
American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our
customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and Mexico.  Our JBI segment began operations in 1989
with a unique partnership with the former Santa Fe Railway (now the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe), a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement
that linked major rail and truck-load carriers in a joint marketing
environment.  Essentially, JBI draws on
the intermodal (also known as “container on flatcar”) services of rail carriers
for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups
and deliveries (“drayage”) for customers at the origin and destination rail
terminal locations.  JBI provides
seamless coordination of the rail and over-the-road transport movements for our
customers and delivers single billing for the complete door-to-door service.


Our intermodal program
has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to over 527,000 in 2003.  JBI operates more than 20,000
company-controlled containers system wide. 
The entire fleet is comprised of 53-foot, high-cube containers and is
designed to take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior
ride quality.  JBI also manages a fleet
of nearly 1,050 tractors and about 1,380 drivers in support of intermodal
operations.  At December 31, 2003,
the total JBI employee count approximated 1,600, including drivers.  Gross revenue for the JBI segment in
calendar year 2003 was $936 million, compared with $809 million in 2002.

DCS Segment

Since 1992, we have offered
dedicated contract carriage as a service option.  DCS segment operations specialize in the design, development, and
execution of supply-chain solutions. 
Capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies, DCS offers engineered
transportation solutions that support private fleet conversion, dedicated fleet
creation and transportation system augmentation.  DCS operations typically provide customized services that are
governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry-van, flatbed and
temperature-controlled operations.  Near
100% on-time service is standard with efficient routes executed to design
specifications.

DCS operations focus on
reducing costs and enhancing customer value through leveraging the JBHT network
for backhaul repositioning freight. 
Network freight may be used to reposition equipment near outbound
domiciles, thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost.  DCS also frequently finds synergy in shared
resources with the JBT and JBI segments, including terminals, drivers, maintenance
shops, bulk fuel locations, and trailer pools providing further economies of
scale.  DCS gross revenue for calendar
year 2003 was $671 million, compared with $628 million in 2002.  At December 31, 2003, the DCS segment
operated 4,456 tractors and employed 5,529 people, 4,898 of whom were drivers.

Logistics Business and Associated
Company

We formally began
offering transportation logistics services in 1992 through a wholly owned
subsidiary, J.B. Hunt Logistics (JBL). 
JBL services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might
outsource a substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation
process to one organization.  The JBL
segment business included a wide range of comprehensive transportation and
management services, including experienced professional managers, information
and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of system
solutions.  A new logistics customer or
service arrangement frequently required a significant amount of up-front
analysis and design time, during which alternatives were considered and custom
systems and software were developed. 
Effective July 1, 2000, we contributed substantially all of our JBL
segment business, all related intangible assets and $5 million of cash  to a newly-formed company, Transplace, Inc.
(TPI).

TPI is an Internet-based
global transportation logistics company. 
TPI commenced operations in July 2000 and initially included
substantially all of the logistics business of JBHT, Covenant Transport, Inc.,
Swift Transportation Co., Inc., U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc., and Werner
Enterprises, Inc.  TPI gross revenue for
calendar year 2003 was $655 million, compared with $672 million in 2002.  We initially had an approximate 27%
ownership interest in TPI.  In
November 2002, we agreed to purchase a portion of Werner Enterprises,
Inc.’s (Werner) ownership interest in TPI. 
Effective January 1, 2003, our interest in TPI increased from 27%
to 37% and Werner’s interest declined from 15% to 5%.  The financial results of TPI are included on a one-line,
non-operating item included on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled
“Equity in loss of associated companies.”

Operations
in Mexico

We have provided
transportation services to and from Mexico since 1989.  These services frequently involve equipment
interchange operations with various Mexican motor carriers.  In addition, a joint venture agreement with
Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), one of the largest transportation companies
in Mexico, was signed in 1992.  The
joint venture, Comercializadora Internacional de Carga S.A. de C.V. and its
subsidiaries, originated and completed northbound and southbound international
truck movements between the United States and Mexico.  The joint venture also provided Mexican domestic irregular route
truck service,


refrigerated freight
services, Mexican dedicated contract business and short-haul drayage to and
from the Mexican maritime ports and rail heads.  For the calendar year ended December 31, 2001, our share of
the Mexican joint venture operating results was included on a one-line,
non-operating item on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings entitled “Equity
in loss of associated companies.”

During the first quarter
of 2002, we sold our joint venture interest in Mexico to TMM.  At December 31, 2003, we have a note
receivable balance of $13.6 million from TMM in connection with this sale.  We still provide transportation services to
and from Mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of Mexican
carriers.

Marketing and Operations

We transport, or arrange
for the transportation of, a wide range of freight, including forest and paper
products, building materials, general merchandise, food and beverages,
chemicals and automotive parts.  Our
customer base is extremely diverse and includes a growing list of Fortune 500
companies.  Our ability to offer
multiple services, utilizing our three business segments and a full complement
of logistics services through third parties, represents a competitive
advantage.  We have been reasonably
successful providing a broad range of transportation services to larger
shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers.  Our largest customer in 2003 was Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenue.

We generally market all
of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network.  We do have some sales and marketing
functions managed at the business unit level, particularly for our DCS
segment.  In accordance with our typical
arrangements, we bill the customer for all services and we, in turn, pay all
third parties for their portion of transportation services provided.  In recent years, we have re-established a
primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments
and charging a fair price for all services provided.

People

We believe that one of
the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our service-oriented
people.  As of December 31, 2003,
we had approximately 15,700 employees, including approximately 11,600
drivers.  We had arrangements with about
1,000 ICs to transport freight in our trailing equipment.  We also employed nearly 1,000 mechanics and
about 3,140 office personnel at the end of 2003.  None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by
collective bargaining agreements.

The truck-load industry
has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified
truck drivers.  It is also common for the
driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100%.  It has been our practice during the past few
years to compensate our drivers at an above-average level in order to attract a
high caliber of experience and minimize turnover.  While the cost to recruit, train and retain drivers has increased
during recent years, we have, to date, not experienced significant operational
disruptions due to a shortage of drivers.

Revenue Equipment

As of December 31,
2003, we operated approximately 9,900 tractors.  In addition, our contracted ICs own and operate their own
tractors, but transport freight in our trailing equipment.  We operate with standardized tractors in as
many fleets as possible, particularly in our JBT and JBI fleets.  Based on customer preference and the actual
business application, our DCS fleet is more diversified.  We believe operating with relatively newer
revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts quality drivers
and lowers maintenance expense.  At
December 31, 2003, the average age of our tractor fleet was 2.4 years, our
trailers were 3.3 years old and our containers were 5.8 years old.  We perform routine servicing and
preventative maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal
facilities.

We generally operate
newer revenue equipment in our JBT segment to minimize downtime and maximize
utilization.  Our JBI segment utilizes
high-cube containers, which can be separated from the chassis and
double-stacked


on rail cars.  We are currently in the process of upgrading
our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet.  The composition of our DCS trailing fleet
varies with specific customer requirements and currently includes dry-vans,
flatbeds and temperature-controlled units.

Effective October 1,
2002, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required that most newly
manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines comply with certain new emission
standards.  In November 2002, we
committed to purchase approximately 2,100 new tractors, primarily for our JBI
and DCS fleets, which were equipped with Mercedes engines.  These engines were exempt from the EPA’s
October 1, 2002 rules.  Except for
these new tractors, which were utilized primarily for local and regional operations,
we limited our new tractor purchases while we tested a limited number of the
new engines.  In late 2003, we commenced
receiving tractors with the new engines. 
While the initial cost of these reduced-emission engines is somewhat
higher, we have not yet determined their impact on operating costs such as
maintenance and fuel economy.  The EPA
has issued additional engine operating limitations which are scheduled to apply
in 2007.

Competition

According to the American
Trucking Associations, the U.S. market for all truck-based transportation
services generated revenues of approximately $605 billion in 2002.  The truck-load market was estimated to
represent about 45% of the total, or approximately $270 billion.  The top ten for-hire truck-load carriers
only generate about 4% of the total revenue in this segment and we represent
less than 1% of this segment revenue. 
The market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly
fragmented and includes thousands of carriers, many of which are very small.  While we compete with a number of smaller
carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent
competition in all markets across the country.

Regulation

Our operations as a
for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT), and certain business is also subject to state rules and
regulations.  The DOT periodically
conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements,
and we report certain accident and other information to the DOT.  Our operations into and out of Canada and
Mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries.

Effective January 4,
2004, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), a separate
administration within the DOT, changed the regulations that govern driver hours
of service.  These new rules were the
most significant changes to driver hours of service in more than 40 years.  In general, the new rules allow a driver to
drive for up to 11 consecutive hours, instead of 10, but require 10 hours of
off-duty time, rather than 8, and reduce the total number of driving hours to
14 in a 24-hour period, compared to 15 under the old rules.  In addition, more off-duty “sleeper berth”
time is required before on-duty time is allowed.  Although the new regulations have only been in effect for a short
time, our current estimates indicate that these new rules should not have a
significant impact on our overall operations. 
However, in certain fleets and a few specific DCS customer applications,
these new rules may increase our cost of operating or reduce our equipment
utilization.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are one of the largest
truck-load transportation and logistics companies in North America.  Our business operations are primarily
organized through three business segments. 
Our JBT segment typically picks up freight loaded in trailers at the
dock or specified location of the shipper and transports a complete truck load
directly to the consignee.  JBT utilizes
primarily company-controlled tractors or ICs and transports freight over
highway routes.  JBI freight is usually
loaded in containers and picked up at a shipper’s location by
company-controlled tractors or designed third-party dray companies and
transported to railroad yards.  This
intermodal container is then transferred from highway vehicles (chassis) and
stacked on rail cars for what is typically the longest leg of the route.  At the destination rail yard, JBI freight is
removed from the rail car, remounted on a chassis and moved to the final
destination by company-controlled tractors or dray carriers.  DCS segment operations vary significantly by
individual customer account.  A DCS
account may involve a limited number of tractors, drivers and trailing
equipment or may include a large fleet. 
The specific services offered frequently range from typical freight
transportation to labor-intensive deliveries, freight handling and other specialized
services.

We separated our JBT and
JBI segment business effective January 1, 2000.  We contributed our JBL business to a newly-formed, associated
logistics company in July 2000.  In
late 2001, we established goals to improve the operating margins of each of our
three segments.  Our financial results
for calendar year 2003 represented the second consecutive year of record
revenues and earnings, driven by strong performance from each of our
segments.  Our financial results for
2003 were impacted by a number of items. 
We implemented a driver pay per diem plan in February 2003.  Under this plan, a portion of certain road
driver’s pay is designated as reimbursement of expense.  This designation provides benefits both to
our driver and to the business. 
Although the driver per diem plan increased our effective income tax
rate, it reduced our total segment operating costs.

During 2003, we also
continued to focus on a process we call yield management.  Yield management is a continuous process of
reviewing our freight to determine whether business which is generating low or
negative margins can be replaced by different business with better
margins.  Management actions may also
involve price changes to ensure that we are charging for all services provided.  These price and freight mix actions favorably
impacted a number of our key segment operating statistics shown in the
following tables, particularly revenue per loaded mile and revenue per tractor
per week.  Our yield management
activities also significantly contributed to our improved margins in 2003,
particularly in our JBT and DCS segments.

We also placed special
emphasis during 2003 on dray costs and equipment utilization in our JBI
segment.  We were able to increase the
average number of loads that our drivers moved by creating pay incentives that
rewarded productivity.  We also improved
our box turns, or what we call velocity, which is the average number of loads
moved by each container each month. 
This continued focus allowed us to reduce our JBI segment operating
ratio to 90.3% in 2003 from 93.3% in 2002 and 94.3% in 2001.


Another area of
management focus during 2003 was maintenance and revenue equipment.  We reduced the average age of our tractor
fleet to 2.4 years at December 31, 2003 from 2.6 years at the end of
2002.  We also converted a portion of
our maintenance work to our company-controlled facilities from
third-party-owned shops.  The
combination of the newer tractor fleet and conversion to our facilities reduced
overall maintenance costs in 2003.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of our
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes.  Therefore, the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these
estimates.  We evaluate these estimates
on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.  Any
effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting
from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in
which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

We consider our critical
accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more
significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements
and include the following:

Workers’ Compensation and Accident Costs

We purchase insurance
coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries (workers’
compensation), vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims.  Most insurance arrangements include a level
of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim, but provide
an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are
completely insured.  The amounts of
self-insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and
policy expiration dates.  During 2003,
we were self-insured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo
loss, personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation and health claims
for amounts up to the first $1.5 million of each claim.  In January 2004, we changed our level
of self-insurance to $2 million for auto accidents and $1 million for workers’
compensation.

Our claims accrual policy
for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the
incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims,
analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal,
economic and regulatory factors.  Our
safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the
insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each
claim.  The ultimate cost of a claim
develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing and
extent of damages claimed becomes available. 
Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim
information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability.  This process involves the use of loss-
development factors based on our historical claims experience.  In doing so, the recorded ultimate liability
considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for
incurred-but-not-reported claims.  We do
not discount our estimated losses.  We
are also substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and
leased revenue equipment.  At
December 31, 2003, we had approximately $8 million of estimated net claims
payable.  In addition, we are required
to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums.  At December 31, 2003, we had a prepaid
insurance asset of approximately $57 million, which represented pre-funded
claims and premiums.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a significant
number of tractors, trailers and containers in connection with our
business.  This equipment may be
purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements.  In addition, we may rent


revenue equipment from third
parties and various railroads under short-term rental arrangements.  Revenue equipment which is purchased is
depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life down to
an estimated salvage or trade-in value. 
Equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net
present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straight-line
method over the lease term or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter.

We have an agreement with
our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or trade-in values for
certain new equipment acquired since 1999. 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, we reviewed the useful lives and
salvage values of our tractor fleet.  We
have utilized the guaranteed trade-in values as well as other operational
information, such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for purchased and
leased tractors.  These changes in
useful lives and salvage values increased net earnings during the fourth quarter
of 2003 by approximately $963,000.  If
our tractor supplier was unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for
guaranteed trade-in values, it could have a materially negative impact on our
financial results.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue
based on the relative transit time of the freight transported.  Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue
which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in
each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and
delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.

Segments

We operated three
segments during calendar year 2003.  The
operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote (11).  The following tables summarize financial and
operating data by segment.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Compared With 2002

Overview of 2003

Our consolidated
net earnings for calendar year 2003 totaled a record $95.5 million, after
reversing $7.7 million of non-cash tax benefits, which resulted from a
sale-and-leaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment.  This compares with our previous record net
earnings of $51.8 million in 2002. 
Diluted earnings per share were $1.17 in 2003, also a record number,
compared with 66 cents in 2002.  The
average number of diluted shares outstanding in 2003 was approximately 5%
higher than the comparable number in 2002. 
Consolidated operating revenues were $2.43 billion in 2003, an increase
of 8% over the $2.25 billion in 2002.


Each of our
business segments contributed to our improved financial results in 2003.  While the overall economy and level of
freight activity were not particularly strong during 2003, a number of factors
contributed to our improved level of earnings. 
We have continued our focus on yield management, as well as individual
load and lane profitability.  A number
of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus have allowed
us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight, and to properly
charge for equipment and services provided to customers.  In addition, significant increases in
certain operating costs, such as insurance, fuel and equipment, have reduced
the level of capacity available in the industry.

JBT Segment

JBT segment gross
revenue was $841.1 million in 2003, up 2% over the $827.3 million in 2002.  Higher fuel prices in 2003 and the resulting
increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue
growth.  The average tractor count in
2003 was down nearly 3% from 2002. 
However, revenue per loaded mile, excluding fuel surcharges, rose 5.2%
in the current year, more than offsetting the decline in the size of the fleet
and enhancing operating income.

Operating income
of the JBT segment rose to $49.3 million in 2003, from $26.6 million in
2002.  In addition to the higher revenue
per mile, we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan (driver per
diem plan) in early 2003.  This new plan
benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased operating income.

JBI Segment

JBI segment gross
revenue grew by 16%, to $936.2 million in 2003, from $809.1 million in
2002.  Revenue growth was due, in part,
to a strong demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated
an 11% increase in number of loads year over year.  Freight mix changes also played an important role that led to
improved revenue per load.

Operating income
in the JBI segment increased to $91.2 million in 2003 from $54.6 million in
2002.  The JBI segment operating ratio
improved by 300 basis points to 90.3% for 2003, compared to 93.3% for
2002.  These improved financial results
were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding
incremental containers, improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and
a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality.

DCS Segment

DCS segment
revenue grew over 6% to $671.2 million in 2003 from $628.3 in 2002.  Revenue net of purchased transportation and
fuel surcharge revenue increased 5%. 
The increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit’s average
tractor count for 2003 declined nearly 2%, compared to 2002.  More than offsetting the decline in the
tractor fleet was a nearly 7% improvement in revenue (excluding fuel surcharge)
per tractor per day.  Driving this
increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of 7% and increased
focus on backhaul opportunities.

Operating income
increased 130% to $45.2 million in 2003 versus $19.7 million in 2002.  At the end of 2002, we began analyzing a
number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy
assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the
segment’s assets.  At the same time,
cost controls were implemented to improve operating results at all
accounts.  The success of these efforts
improved the operating ratio by 360 basis points, to 93.3% in 2003.  Cost reductions in driver pay, salary and
office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced 2003 operating
income.  A decline of 16% in the average
age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing
commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment’s insurance
and claims costs.  We also incurred
certain new start-up costs in 2002 associated with several large accounts that
did not impact 2003.  Revenue growth
will continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer
opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment
of additional assets.


The following
table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a
percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of
those items as compared with the prior year.

Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Total operating
expenses increased 4.7% in 2003 over 2002, while operating revenues increased
8.3%.  The combination of the change in
these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 310 basis points
to 92.4% in 2003, from 95.5% in 2002. 
As previously mentioned, increases in revenue per loaded mile, excluding
fuel surcharges, and the implementation of a driver per diem plan were two of
the more significant factors driving these changes.  We also increased the number of independent contractors (ICs) in
our JBT fleet to 994 at December 31, 2003 from 679 at the end of
2002.  When we replace company-operated
tractors and driver employees with ICs, certain costs such as salaries, wages,
employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased
transportation increase.

Fuel cost per
gallon was approximately 13% higher in 2003 over 2002.  However, we have fuel surcharge programs in
place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges
relatively quickly when fuel costs change. 
If fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact
from timing differences between financial reporting periods when fuel costs
change more quickly than our compensating fuel surcharges.  We recovered through our fuel surcharge
programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs experienced in calendar
year 2003.  We currently have no
contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs.  Insurance and claims costs rose during 2003,
primarily due to higher premium costs. 
While our accident frequency declined in 2003, severity, or the cost per
accident, increased over 2002.  General
and administrative expenses include driver recruiting and testing, bad debts and
professional service fees, all of which increased in 2003.  Gains and losses on revenue equipment
dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative
category.  We had a net loss of
approximately $1.1 million on equipment and other dispositions in 2003,
compared with a $1.8 million loss in 2002. 
These losses were primarily a result of revenue equipment which was lost
or written off.


Our net interest
expense declined to $17.2 million in 2003, from $24.8 million in 2002.  We were able to reduce our total debt levels
to $172 million as of December 31, 2003, from $343 million at the end of
2002.  This reduced debt level was
primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in 2003 and proceeds from
a secondary stock offering which closed in mid-2002.  Our effective income tax rate increased to 43.1% in 2003, from
30.8% in 2002.  This higher tax rate was
primarily due to our increased level of earnings, the driver per diem plan and
a reversal of a $7.7 million non-cash tax benefit taken in 2003 related to
certain sale-leaseback transactions that closed in 1999.  As previously mentioned, we implemented a
driver per diem pay plan in early 2003. 
This plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to
the company.  However, it does result in
an increase in our effective income tax rate. 
The $7.7 million reversal of tax benefits was retroactive to January 1,
2003, and related to a proposed adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service that
would disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of sale-and-leaseback
transactions, which occurred in 1999. 
In addition to the reversal of tax benefits recorded in 2003, we have
suspended the recognition of any future tax benefits effective January 1,
2004.  This issue is discussed in
further detail under “Risk Factors.”

The “Equity in
loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings
reflects our share of the operating results for Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  Effective January 1, 2003, we increased
our interest in TPI to approximately 37%, from 27% in 2002.  JBHT’s financial exposure is limited to its
approximate $7.8 million investment in TPI since we have not made any
additional commitments or guaranteed any of TPI’s financial obligations.

Compared With 2001

Overview of 2002

Our consolidated
net earnings for calendar year 2002 were $51.8 million, or diluted earnings per
share of 66 cents, compared with 2001 full-year earnings of $32.9 million, or
46 cents per diluted share.  We
generated $101 million of operating income in 2002, a nearly 40% increase over
the $72.2 million of operating income in 2001. 
Our operating ratio was 95.5% in 2002 and 96.6% in 2001.  Our increase in 2002 net earnings was in
spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to 30.8% from 23.5% in 2001
and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 8%.  The increase in shares outstanding reflected
a secondary public offering, which closed in June 2002.   Each of our three segments contributed to
the improved earnings levels in 2002.

JBT Segment

JBT segment gross
revenue was essentially flat, totaling $827.3 million in 2002 and $828.6
million in 2001.  However, 2002 revenues
were generated with approximately 3% fewer tractors.  In addition, 2002 fuel surcharge revenues were $14.2 million
lower than the comparable amount in 2001, which negatively impacted the revenue
comparison by approximately 2%.  Truck
segment operating income rose to $26.6 million in 2002, from $8.7 million in
2001.  The improvement in 2002 operating
income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile, reduced empty miles and lower
driver pay rates.  A significant portion
of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of
our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality.  A reduction in driver pay per mile was
primarily a result of changes in pay scales for newly-hired drivers.

JBI Segment

JBI segment gross
revenue grew 9% to $809.1 million in 2002, from $740.5 million in 2001.  Revenue growth was due, in part, to
continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our
container fleet to solely 53-foot units. 
Operating income in the JBI segment rose to $54.6 million in 2002 from
$42.1 million in 2001.  Our JBI
operating ratio was 93.3% in 2002 and 94.3% in 2001.  Financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved
container utilization, improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue
quality.


DCS Segment

DCS segment
revenue grew nearly 15% to $628.3 million in 2002, from $548.7 million in
2001.  Revenue growth was primarily a
result of a 9% increase in the size of the DCS tractor fleet and our focus on
improving the quality of individual fleets. 
While operating income rose to $19.7 million in 2002 from $17.4 million
in 2001, the segment’s operating ratio was 96.9% in 2002 and 96.8% in
2001.  We reduced some costs in the DCS
segment, such as driver pay and overhead; however, higher accident and claims
expenses, as well as new account start-up costs, more than offset the
improvements.

The following
table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a
percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of
those items as compared with the prior year.

Consolidated
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses
in 2002 increased 5.9% over 2001, while operating revenues rose 7.0%.  Our operating ratio improved to 95.5% in
2002, compared with 96.6% in 2001.  Salaries,
wages and employee benefits expense increased 3.6% in 2002, and declined to
36.4% of revenue in 2002 from 37.6% in 2001. 
As previously mentioned, a lower mileage pay rate in our JBT segment for
newly-hired drivers and the use of additional independent contractors were
primary contributors to the relationship of this cost category to operating
revenues.  Partly offsetting a decline
in drivers’ wages relative to revenue were increases in maintenance wages,
workers’ compensation, health insurance and office employee incentive
expenses.  We opened some new
company-managed maintenance facilities and increased our mechanic labor force
by about 14% in order to reduce the amount of maintenance that we
outsource.  We also experienced higher
costs in workers’ compensation and other fringe benefit programs and paid
additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel that
resulted from improved 2002 net earnings.

Rents and purchased
transportation expense increased 15.5%, primarily due to the growth of our JBI
business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and
the use of more independent


contractors.  The 6.8% decline in fuel and fuel tax
expense was primarily a result of fuel costs per gallon averaging about 5% less
vs. 2001.  Operating supplies and
expenses were down 10.3% in 2002, reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced
tractor and trailer maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses.  The 32.4% increase in insurance and claims
costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums that have been
experienced industry-wide and our higher accident costs.  The significant increase in general and
administrative expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and
recruiting expense in 2002 and changes in our gains and losses on revenue
equipment dispositions.  In 2002, we had
a $1.8 million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions, compared with a
net gain of $4.8 million in 2001.

Our net interest expense
declined in 2002, partly due to the approximate $68 million of capital we
raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in
June 2002.  We increased our
effective income tax rate to 30.8% in 2002, from 23.5% in 2001, primarily to
reflect additional taxes associated with our increased earnings.

Equity in losses of
associated companies reflects our share of operating results for TPI and for
our Mexican joint venture.  Amounts
included the following:

The year 2001 financial
results of our Mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the
carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our
interests.  During the first quarter of
2002, we sold our joint-venture interest in Mexico for its carrying value, to
the majority owner, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM).  We recorded an $18.1 million note receivable
from TMM, which, according to the terms of the sale, was to be paid in four
annual payments of approximately $4.5 million, plus interest at 5% per annum,
through June 2005.  In
June 2002, we agreed to extend the principal payment to June 2006.  We have received interest payments within
the terms of the renegotiated note.  We
are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable
of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2003. 
The next principal and interest payment is due in June 2004.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow

We generate significant
amounts of cash from operating activities. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $333 million in 2003, $174
million in 2002, and $172 million in 2001. 
The significant changes in trade accounts payable which appear on our
consolidated statements of cash flows for 2003 and 2002 were partly a result of
timing differences among years of insurance-related items.  Cash flows used in investing activities
primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue
equipment.  During the latter part of
2000, through late 2001, we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors.  Tractor additions since October 2001
have been purchased.  In late 2003, we
began purchasing tractors that were under capital lease programs at the end of
the initial lease term.  We paid
approximately $47 million in residual values for tractors under lease
arrangements that terminated in 2003 and anticipate purchasing the remaining
leased tractors for approximately $67 million in 2004.  In December 2003, we purchased
approximately $19.6 million of intermodal trailing equipment that had been
under an operating lease program.  The
majority of trailing equipment additions during 2000 and 2001 were under
operating lease agreements.  These lease
agreements mature over a four-year period beginning in 2006 and ending in
2009.  Since March 2002,
predominately all trailing equipment additions have been purchased.


The $95 million of
outstanding 7.00% Notes are due in September 2004, and the final $10
million of 7.80% Subordinated Notes are due in October 2004.  We anticipate that our current cash balance,
cash flow generated from operations during the year and unused revolving lines
of credit will be sufficient to retire this debt as it comes due.  By the end of 2004, we anticipate that our
only remaining obligations will consist primarily of operating leases for
trailing equipment.

Selected Balance Sheet Data

From time to time, our
Board of Directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock.  However, we have not repurchased any of our
common stock since 2000.

Liquidity

Our need for capital
typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to
support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new,
late-model equipment.  We are frequently
able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on
market conditions.  We have recently
obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering, revolving lines of
credit and cash generated from operations. 
We have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue
equipment.

As mentioned above, we
utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late 2000 through late
2001.  Since late 2001, we have been
acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and plan
to continue purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future.  We currently are committed to spend in the
range of $185 million, net of expected proceeds from sale or trade-in
allowances, on revenue equipment for 2004 and believe our current cash on hand,
cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide
sufficient funds.

We are authorized to
borrow up to $150 million under our current revolving lines of credit, which
expire November 14, 2005.  We had
no balances outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2003, and also
no outstanding balances at the end of 2002. 
Under the terms of our credit and note agreements, we are required to
maintain certain financial covenants, including leverage tests, minimum tangible
net worth tests, and other financial ratios. 
We were in compliance with all financial covenants at December 31,
2003.  Also, our revolving lines of
credit do not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or
amounts due under the agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

All of our leases related
to tractors have been accounted for as capital leases and are carried on our
balance sheet.  Our only off-balance
sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment, which
are described above.  As of
December 31, 2003, we had approximately 20,300 trailers and 6,660
containers/chassis that were operated subject to operating leases, and we had
approximately $207 million of obligations remaining under these leases.  Our standby letters of credit are also not
recorded on our books at December 31, 2003, since there were no balances
outstanding at that time under these arrangements.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to general economic and business
factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a
materially adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our business is dependent
upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the
results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include significant increases
or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry,
surpluses in the market for used equipment, interest rates, fuel taxes, license
and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, and difficulty
in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors.

We are also affected by
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles,
particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing,
where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions may adversely affect our
customers and their ability to pay for our services.  Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a
greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for
bad-debt losses.  In addition, our
results of operations may


be affected by seasonal
factors.  Customers tend to reduce
shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to
be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather, which causes
higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry.  Numerous factors could impair our ability to
maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers.

Some of these factors
include:

•

We
compete with many other truck-load carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser
extent, with less-than-truck-load carriers and railroads, some of which have
more equipment and greater capital resources than we do.

•

Many
of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business,
especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit
our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit
margins.

•

Many
customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called “core
carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances
we may not be selected.

•

Many
customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping
needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some
business to competitors.

•

The
trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large
carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages
relating to their size.

•

Advances
in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our
customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost
of these investments.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few
major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially
adverse effect on our business.

For the calendar year
ended December 31, 2003, our top ten customers, based on revenue,
accounted for approximately 38% of our revenue.  Our largest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted
for approximately 13% of our total revenue in 2003.  Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers,
and we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize
our services or that they will continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our
services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse
effect on our business and operating results.

We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.

Our Intermodal business
segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation
services.  These services are provided
pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads.  While we have agreements with various Class
I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railway and the Norfolk Southern Railroad.  The inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could
have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.  In addition, a portion of the freight we
deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject
to labor union contracts.

Difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our
profitability and ability to grow.

Periodically, the
trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and
retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors.  If we are unable to continue to attract
drivers or contract with


independent contractors,
we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks
sit idle, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

Ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly
reduce our earnings.

Our future insurance and
claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our
earnings. During 2003, we self-insured for a portion of our claims exposure
resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, workers’
compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first $1.5 million of each
claim.  In January 2004, we changed
our level of self-insurance to $2 million for auto accidents and $1 million for
workers’ compensation.  If the number or
severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating
results could be adversely affected. 
Also, we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self-insure
with licensed insurance companies. 
Insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking
companies.  As a result, our insurance
and claims expenses could increase when our current coverage expires on
July 31, 2004, or we could be required to raise our self-insured
retention.  If these expenses increase,
and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our
earnings could be materially and adversely affected.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow
the tax benefits associated with certain sale- and-leaseback transactions.

In 1999, we entered into
a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our
Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately
$175 million.  This transaction was
recently examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 income tax
returns, and on December 15, 2003, we received a revenue agent’s report summarizing
adjustments proposed by the IRS arising from this audit.  The IRS proposes to disallow the tax
benefits associated with this transaction based on their interpretation of
existing tax laws and court precedents. 
We believe this transaction conforms with the applicable tax law, and we
intend to vigorously defend against the IRS position using all administrative
and legal processes available.  We have
received the IRS Notice of Proposed Assessment and, as a result, we have filed
an appeal in the matter.  If a
resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process, the IRS will
forward a 90-day letter, also known as a Notice of Deficiency.  A resolution of the dispute could occur at
any point in this procedure or could extend through a trial and court
appeals.  After receiving the IRS Notice
of Proposed Assessment, applicable accounting literature dictated that we
reverse all of the 2003 expected non-cash tax benefits of approximately $7.7
million and cease any further recognition of the benefit.  There is no impact on the benefits taken in
prior years; however, if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction, we
could owe additional taxes and interest. 
We estimate our maximum earnings exposure to be $31 million, which
represents the tax benefits realized through December 31, 2002, plus
estimated accrued interest through December 31, 2003.  This exposure would result if the IRS
succeeded in disallowing 100% of the tax benefits from this transaction.

Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and
regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or
penalties.

We are subject to various
environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous
materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm
water.  We operate in industrial areas,
where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where
groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel
spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous wastes disposal, among
others.  We also maintain bulk fuel
storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If we are involved in a spill or other accident
involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable
laws or regulations, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business
and operating results.  If we should
fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject
to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.


We operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased
direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of,
existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our
business.

The U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our
business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in
motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial
reporting.  We are audited periodically
by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety,
hours-of-service and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict
or otherwise impact our operations.

Effective January 4,
2004, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), an
administration within the DOT, changed the regulations that govern driver hours
of service.  These new rules generally
allow a driver to drive for up to 11 consecutive hours, rather than 10, but
require 10 hours of off-duty time, rather than 8.  In addition, more off-duty “sleeper berth” time is required
before on-duty time is allowed.  These
new rules could increase our operating costs or reduce our equipment
utilization.

As part of a 1998 consent
decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a number of
heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions
from their engines produced subsequent to October 1, 2002.  In November 2002, we committed to
purchase approximately 2,100 new tractors, primarily for our JBI and DCS
segments, that were equipped with Mercedes engines.  These engines were not covered by the EPA’s October 1, 2002
rules.  In late 2003, we commenced
receiving tractors with the new engines. 
While the initial cost of these reduced-emission engines is somewhat
higher, we have not yet determined their impact on operating costs such as
maintenance and fuel economy.  The EPA
has issued additional engine operating limitations that are scheduled to apply
in 2007.

Fuel and fuel taxes
currently represent our third-largest general expense category.  During the past three years, fuel cost per
gallon has varied significantly, with prices frequently changing as much as
$.10 to $.15 per gallon between consecutive months.  We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the
majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the
majority of higher fuel costs.  Most of
these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differences
between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed
to our customers.  In addition, we incur
additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to
our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or out-of-route miles
that cannot be billed to customers. 
Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a
materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2003, we had no
derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations.

We have a $13.6 million note receivable from Transportacion
Maritima Mexicana (TMM) related to the sale of our share of a Mexican joint
venture.

During the first quarter
of 2002, we sold our joint-venture interest in Mexico to TMM.  In accordance with the original terms of the
sale, we recorded an $18.1 million note receivable, which was to be paid in
four annual payments of approximately $4.5 million, plus interest.  In June 2002, we agreed to extend the
principal payment to June 2006.  We
are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable
of $13.6 million as of December 31, 2003. 
The next principal and interest payment is due in June 2004.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 143,

Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations.

Statement 143 required us to record the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that
result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of
the assets.  We also were required to
record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the
asset.  Subsequent to the initial
measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation should be
adjusted at the


end of each period to
reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows
underlying the obligation.  We adopted
Statement 143 on January 1, 2003.  The
adoption of Statement 143 did not have a material effect on our financial
statements.

In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An
Interpretation of ARB No. 51

. 
This Interpretation addressed the consolidation by business enterprises
of variable-interest entities as defined in the Interpretation.  The Interpretation applied immediately to
variable interests in variable-interest entities created after January 31,
2003, and to variable interests in variable-interest entities obtained after
January 31, 2003.  On
October 9, 2003, the FASB staff issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial
Interpretation No. 46-6, which deferred the effective date for applying the
provisions until March 31, 2004. 
The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 is not expected to have a material
effect on our financial statements.

ITEM 7a.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings are
affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of
short-term debt. We from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate
the effects of interest rate changes; 
none were outstanding at December 31, 2003.  Risk can be estimated by measuring the
impact of a near-term adverse movement of 10% in short-term market interest
rates.  If short-term market interest
rates average 10% more during the next 12 months, there would be no materially
adverse impact on our results of operations based on variable-rate debt
outstanding at December 31, 2003. 
At December 31, 2003, the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term
obligations approximated carrying value.

Although we
conduct business in foreign countries, international operations are not
material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.  Additionally, foreign currency
transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2003. 
Accordingly, we are not currently subject to material foreign currency
exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign
currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would
receive from our foreign investment.  To
date, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts
or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The price and
availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the
level of global oil production, seasonality, weather and other market
factors.  Historically, we have been
able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the
form of fuel surcharges.  We cannot
predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future
or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such
increases.  As of December 31,
2003, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel
price fluctuations.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA


Independent
Auditors’ Report

The Board of Directors

J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J. B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2003.  These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America.  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of J. B. Hunt Transport Services,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated
Statement

December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001

(1)

Business

J. B. Hunt Transport
Services, Inc. (JBHT or we), together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, are
one of the largest truck-load transportation and logistics companies in North
America.  We directly transport or arrange
for the transportation of full truck-load, containerizable freight, while
operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation and
various state regulatory agencies.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

(A)

Basis of Consolidation

JBHT’s
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements and those of
our wholly owned subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(B)

Use of Estimates

The
consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.  The preparation of
these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that directly
affect the amounts reported in such statements and accompanying notes.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing
basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and using other
methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, our actual results may differ
significantly from our estimates.

We
believe that certain accounting policies and estimates are of more significance
in our financial statement preparation process that others.  We believe the most critical accounting
policies and estimates include the economic useful lives and salvage values of
our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of
exposures under our insurance and claims plans, and various other recorded or
disclosed amounts.  To the extent that
actual, final outcomes are different than our estimates, or additional facts
and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that
accounting period will be affected.

(C)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

(D)

Tires in Servic

e

We
capitalize tires placed in service on new revenue equipment as a part of the
equipment cost.  Replacement tires and
costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in
service.

(E)

Property and Equipment

Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of 3 to 15 years for revenue and service equipment, 10
to 40 years for structures and improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture and
office equipment.


We
reviewed our tractor estimated useful lives and salvage values during the fourth
quarter of 2003.  Based on guaranteed
trade-in values from a primary tractor supplier and certain other operating
data, we changed the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain
tractors effective October 1, 2003. 
These changes increased 2003 net earnings by $963,000.

Property
and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum
lease payments and amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the
shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.

(F)

Revenue Recognition

We
recognize revenue based on relative transit time in each reporting period with
expenses recognized as incurred.

(G)

Income Taxes

Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

(H)

Earnings Per Share

A
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted earnings
per share is shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):


Options
to purchase shares of common stock that were outstanding during each year, but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares, are shown in the table below.

On July 17, 2003, we
announced a two-for-one stock split on our common stock, payable
August 29, 2003, to stockholders of record on July 31, 2003.  All references in our financial statements
and report on Form 10-K with regard to number of shares and the per share
amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split.

(I)

Credit Risk

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk,
consist primarily of trade receivables. 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited due to our large number of customers and the diverse range of
industries they represent.  As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had no significant concentrations of credit
risk.

(J)

Foreign Currency Translation

Local
currencies are generally considered the functional currencies outside the
United States.  Assets and liabilities
are translated at year-end exchange rates for operations in local currency
environments.  Income and expense items are
translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Foreign
currency translation adjustments, which reflect foreign currency exchange rate
changes applicable to the net assets of the Mexican operations, have been
recorded as a separate item of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2001.  This investment was sold during 2002.

(K)

Stock-Based Compensation

We
have adopted the intrinsic value based method of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

and related interpretations in accounting for compensation costs for our stock
option plans.  Accordingly, compensation
expense is recognized on the date of grant only if the current market price of
the underlying common stock at date of grant exceeds the exercise price.


Had we determined
compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for our stock
options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

, our net earnings would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Pro forma net earnings
reflects only options granted since December 31, 1995.  Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation costs for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the
pro forma net earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is
reflected over the options’ vesting periods of 5 to 10 years and compensation
cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1996, is not considered.

The per share
weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001
was $12.90, $7.26 and $5.41, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black
Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:  2003 - expected dividend
yield 0.0%, volatility of 57.4%, risk-free interest rate of 1.53% and an
expected life of 6.3 years;  2002 -
expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 54.9%, risk-free interest rate of
3.2%, and an expected life of 6.7 years; 
2001 - expected dividend yield 0.0%, volatility of 59.9%, risk-free
interest rate of 4.7%, and an expected life of 6.2 years.

(L)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

We continually evaluate
the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in circumstances which
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. 
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell.


(M)

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income
consists of net earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments and is
presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

(N)

Claims Accruals

Claims payable represent
accruals for the self-insured portion of pending accident liability, workers’
compensation and physical damage.  These
accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of
individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based on our
past claims experience.  Our claims
accrual policy for all self-insurance is to recognize the expense when the
event occurs and the costs of such events are probable and reasonably
estimable.  We apply loss development
factors to our accident and workers’ compensation claims history as a part of
our process of recording the expense of losses which are incurred but not
reported.  We do not discount our
estimated losses.

Our insurance coverage
for the two years ended December 31, 2003, specified that the self-insured
limit on the majority of our claims was $1.5 million, which is prefunded with
our insurance carrier.  We changed our
self-insured retention to $2 million for auto accidents and to $1 million for
workers’ compensation effective January 1, 2004.  We are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our
owned and leased revenue equipment.

(O)

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 143,

Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations.

Statement 143 required us to record the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that
result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of
the assets.  We also were required to
record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the
asset.  Subsequent to the initial
measurement of the asset retirement obligation, the obligation should be
adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes
in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation.  We adopted Statement 143 on January 1,
2003.  The adoption of Statement 143 did
not have a material effect on our financial statements.

In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An
Interpretation of ARB No. 51

. 
This Interpretation addressed the consolidation by business enterprises
of variable-interest entities as defined in the Interpretation.  The Interpretation applied immediately to
variable interests in variable-interest entities created after January 31,
2003, and to variable interests in variable-interest entities obtained after
January 31, 2003.  On
October 9, 2003, the FASB staff issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Financial
Interpretation No. 46-6, which deferred the effective date for applying the
provisions until March 31, 2004. 
The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 is not expected to have a material
effect on our financial statements.


(3)

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists
of (in thousands):

We are authorized to
issue up to $150 million under our current revolving lines of credit.  These lines of credit are supported by
credit agreements with a group of banks, which expire November 14,
2005.  No balances were outstanding
under these lines of credit at December 31, 2003.  The 7.80% senior subordinated notes are
payable in five equal annual installments of $10 million, which commenced
October 30, 2000.

Under the terms of the
credit agreements and the note agreements, we are required to maintain certain
financial covenants, including leverage tests, minimum tangible net worth
levels and other financial ratios.  We
were in compliance with all of the financial covenants at December 31,
2003.

(4)

Capital Stock

In late May and
June 2002, we closed an offering of approximately 11.8 million shares
(adjusted for the  stock split in 2003)
of common stock.  Approximately 5.6
million shares were issued and sold by JBHT and 6.2 million shares were sold by
a shareholder.  The selling price of the
stock was $13 ($26 before the stock split in 2003) per share before underwriter
discounts and other expenses.

We maintain a Management
Incentive Plan (“Plan”) that provides various financial vehicles to compensate
our key employees with JBHT common stock or common stock equivalents.  Under the Plan, as amended, we are
authorized to award, in aggregate, not more than 17 million shares. At
December 31, 2003, there were approximately 2.4 million shares available
for grant under the Plan.  We have
utilized three such vehicles to award stock or grant options to purchase JBHT
common stock: restricted stock awards, restricted options and


nonstatutory stock
options.  As of December 31, 2003,
there are no restricted stock awards or restricted options issued or
outstanding.

The Plan provides that
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to key employees for the purchase of
JBHT common stock for 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the
grant date.  The options generally vest
over a 10-year period and are forfeited if the employee terminates for any
reason.    The Plan allows the employee
to surrender shares of common stock that the employee already owns in full or
partial payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or to
satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option.

A summary of the
restricted and nonstatutory options to purchase JBHT common stock follows:

During 1995, our Board of
Directors established a nonqualified stock option plan to provide performance-
based compensation to the Chairman of the Board (Chairman’s Plan).  The Chairman’s Plan allowed the Chairman the
option to purchase up to 5.0 million shares (adjusted for the 2003 stock split)
of JBHT common stock at a price of $8.81 per share (adjusted for the stock
split).  These options vested after five
years.  The Chairman’s Plan allowed the
Chairman to surrender shares of common stock which he already owned in full or
partial payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or to
satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option.  Under the original Chairman’s Plan, the
options were to be exercised within one year of vesting and all unexercised
options would have terminated.  During
2000, our stockholders amended the Chairman’s Plan whereby the exercise period
was extended two years from date of vesting. 
Two


million options were
exercised during the year ended December 31, 2002, and three million
options were exercised in 2001.  There
were no options outstanding for the Chairman’s Plan at December 31, 2003.

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31,
2003:

The
weighted average exercise price per share of options exercisable at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $8.20 and $8.57, respectively.

(5)

Income Taxes

Total income tax expense
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was allocated as
follows (in thousands):


Income taxes payable at
December 31, 2003 were $1,729,000 and refundable income taxes at
December 31, 2002, were $8,538,000. 
These amounts have been included in other current liabilities and assets
on the balance sheet, respectively.

Income tax expense
attributable to earnings before income taxes consists of (in thousands):

Income tax expense
attributable to earnings before income taxes differed from the amounts computed
using the statutory federal tax rate of 35% for the following reasons (in
thousands):


The tax effects of
temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002, are
presented below (in thousands):

We believe our history of
profitability and taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and
our utilization of tax planning sufficiently supports the carrying amount of
the deferred tax assets.  Accordingly,
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as all deferred tax benefits are
more likely than not to be realized.

At December 31,
2003, we had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards with no expiration of
approximately $11,392,000.


In 1999, we
entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a
portion of our Intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of
approximately $175 million.  This
transaction was recently examined by the IRS in an audit of our 1998 and 1999
income tax returns, and on December 15, 2003, we received a revenue
agent’s report summarizing adjustments proposed by the IRS arising from this
audit.  The IRS proposes to disallow the
tax benefits associated with this transaction based on their interpretation of
existing tax laws and court precedents. 
We believe this transaction conforms with the applicable tax law, and we
intend to vigorously defend against the IRS position using all administrative
and legal processes available.  We have
received the IRS Notice of Proposed Assessment and, as a result, we have filed
an appeal in the matter.  If a
resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process, the IRS will
forward a 90-day letter, also known as a Notice of Deficiency.  A resolution of the dispute could occur at
any point in this procedure or could extend through a trial and court
appeals.  After receiving the IRS Notice
of Proposed Assessment, applicable accounting literature dictated that we
reverse all of the 2003 expected non-cash tax benefits of approximately $7.7
million and cease any further recognition of the benefit.  There is no impact on the benefits taken in
prior years; however, if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction, we
could owe additional taxes and interest. 
We estimate our maximum earnings exposure to be $31 million, which
represents the tax benefits realized through December 31, 2002, plus
estimated accrued interest through December 31, 2003.  This exposure would result if the IRS
succeeded in disallowing 100% of the tax benefits from this transaction.

(6)

Employee Benefit Plans

We maintain a defined
contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a 401(k) option, under
which all employees are eligible to participate.  We match a specified percentage of employee contributions,
subject to certain limitations.  For the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, JBHT matching contributions
to the plan were $6.2 million, $6.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Fair Value of Significant
Financial Instruments

(A)

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts
Receivable, and Trade Accounts Payable

The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

(B)

Long-Term Debt

The
fair value of the fixed-rate debt is presented as the present value of future
cash flows discounted using our current borrowing rate for notes of comparable
maturity.  The calculation arrives at a
theoretical amount we would pay a creditworthy third party to assume our
fixed-rate obligations and not the termination value of these obligations.
Consistent with market practices, such termination values may include various
prepayment and termination fees that we would contractually be required to pay
if we retired the debt early.

The
estimated fair values of our financial instruments are summarized as follows
(in thousands):


(8)

Related Party Transactions

We advanced premiums on
life insurance policies on the lives of our Senior Chairman of the Board of
Directors and his wife.  In 2002, we
ceased advancing premiums on these policies. 
All premiums paid by JBHT, along with accrued interest thereon, are
reimbursable from a trust which is the owner and beneficiary of the
policy.  We have a guarantee from the
stockholders for the amount of premiums paid by JBHT together with interest at
the rate of 5% per annum through June 2000.  In July 2000, our Board of Directors approved an adjustment
to the interest rate to be our average borrowing rate when additional advances
were made.  The interest rate changed to
7.42% in August 2001 and to 7.39% in July 2002.  Beginning in July 2003, the monthly
interest rate varies and is based on our actual average cost of borrowed
funds.  The interest rate ranged from a
high of 7.76% to a low of 7.50% during the last six months of 2003.  The amounts reimbursable to JBHT amount to
approximately $10.7 million and $10.2 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, and are included in other assets in our accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  See also
note 10 for disclosure of transactions with an affiliated company.

Commitments and Contingencies

During 1999, we entered
into a sale-and-leaseback transaction for a portion of our container
fleet.  Containers having a net book
value of approximately $175 million were sold to third-party leasing companies
at approximate net book value.  A gain
on the transaction has been deferred and will be amortized to income in
relation to rent expense recognized under the leases.  The containers are being leased back under operating leases over
terms of four to ten years. 
Approximately $19.6 million of this intermodal trailing equipment was
repurchased in December 2003.  As
of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $207 million of obligations
remaining under operating lease arrangements related to trailing equipment.  We also lease terminal facilities, shuttle
yards and computer equipment under operating leases having various terms.  None of our operating leases contain any
guaranteed residual value clauses. 
Under the terms of certain lease agreements, we are required to maintain
certain covenants, including minimum credit ratings.  We were in compliance with these requirements at
December 31, 2003.

During 2000, we entered
into various capital lease agreements to lease tractors.  These capital leases are secured by revenue
equipment with a net book value at December 31, 2003, of approximately
$66.8 million and contain certain guarantees of residual value at the end of
the lease terms with fixed-price purchase options.


Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease
terms in excess of one year) and future minimum capital lease payments as of
December 31, 2003, are (in thousands):

At December 31, 2003
and 2002, gross property and equipment recorded under capital leases was
$110,846,000 and $193,953,000, respectively.

Total rent expense was
$109,133,000 in 2003, $115,084,000 in 2002, and $98,783,000 in 2001.

At December 31,
2003, we had committed to purchase approximately $185,000,000 of revenue and
service equipment, net of expected proceeds from sale or trade-in allowances.

During 2003, we issued
financial standby letters of credit as a guarantee of our performance under
certain operating lease commitments and self-insurance arrangements.  If we default on our commitments under the
lease agreements or other arrangements, we are required to perform under these
guarantees.  The undiscounted maximum
amount of our obligation to make future payments in the event of defaults is
approximately $66,844,000.  As of
December 31, 2003, no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses
under the obligations, as it is probable that the suppliers will be able to
make all scheduled payments.


The IRS has proposed to
disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of transactions affecting a
sale and leaseback of intermodal equipment. 
See note 5 for additional information.

We are involved in
certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of
business.  Based on the present
knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we
believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a
materially adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of
operations.

Investment in Affiliated Company

In March 2000, we,
along with five other motor carriers, announced the intent to contribute all of
our non-asset based logistics business into a recently formed joint venture,
Transplace, Inc. (TPI).  TPI is an
Internet-based global transportation logistics company.  TPI commenced operations effective
July 1, 2000.  We contributed all
of our logistics segment business and all related intangible assets, plus $5.0
million of cash, in exchange for an approximate 27% initial membership interest
in TPI.  On December 31, 2002, we
acquired an additional 10% interest in TPI from one of the initial
members.  We account for our approximate
37% interest in TPI utilizing the equity method of accounting.  No gain or loss was recognized upon
formation and contribution of logistics segment assets to TPI.  Equity in earnings of TPI was a loss of
$694,000 in 2003.

We provided various
services to TPI under a shared-service agreement, the terms of which expired on
December 31, 2003.  The services
included primarily computer system operations and maintenance.  The fees from these services approximated
$6.3 million in each year of 2003 and 2002, and were recorded in the
consolidated statement of earnings as reimbursements of general and
administrative expenses.   An agreement
for similar services was signed in early 2004.

We
earned revenues of $57,636,000 and $40,406,000 from TPI in providing
transportation services during 2003 and 2002, respectively.

At December 31, 2003
and 2002, trade accounts receivable included $5,883,000 and $2,383,000, respectively,
due from TPI for freight and fees related to the shared-service agreement.

For the years ending
December 31, 2003 and 2002, we incurred approximately $14,298,000 and
$34,994,000, respectively, in purchased transportation expense as a result of
TPI providing transportation services.

Segment Information

We have three reportable
business segments, Truck (JBT), Intermodal (JBI), and Dedicated Contract
Services (DCS).  JBT business includes
full truck-load, dry-van freight which is typically transported utilizing
company-owned or controlled revenue equipment. 
This freight is typically transported over roads and highways and does
not move by rail.  The JBI segment includes
freight that is transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement
and also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI equipment or
third-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to direct JBI
equipment back toward intermodal operations. 
DCS segment business typically includes company-owned revenue equipment
and employee drivers that are


assigned to a specific
customer, traffic lane or service.  DCS
operations usually include formal, written long-term agreements or contracts
which govern services performed and applicable rates.

Our customers are
geographically dispersed across the United States and include many of the
Fortune 500 companies.  One customer
accounted for approximately 13%, 18% and 16% of consolidated operating revenues
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  A
summary of certain segment information is presented below (in millions):
