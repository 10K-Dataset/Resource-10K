PART I

ITEM 1:

BUSINESS

ANSYS Inc. develops, markets and globally supports engineering simulation
software and technologies widely used by engineers and analysts across a broad spectrum of industries. ANSYS focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common
platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. The Company distributes its ANSYS®, DesignSpace®, AI*NASTRAN and ICEM CFD suite of products through a network of
channel partners in 37 countries, in addition to its own direct sales offices in 20 strategic locations throughout the world, as well as through distribution arrangements with developers of other design software products.

The Company’s major product lines are described as follows:

ANSYS® Simulation Suite

Incorporating design simulation and virtual prototyping into a product development process is critical to minimize costs and improve time-to-market. With the ANSYS Simulation Suite, you can determine
real-world structural, thermal, electromagnetic and fluid-flow behavior of 3-D product designs, including the effects of multiple physics when they are coupled together for added accuracy and reliability.

ANSYS® Physics Verticals

ANSYS Physics Verticals may be used independently or in conjunction with other ANSYS products, such as ANSYS
Mechanical™, to enable an even more comprehensive simulation of real-world phenomena. These products are focused towards specific industries to solve problems such as electromagnetic interference, antenna design, aerodynamic design, crash
dynamics, metal forming and product design reliability.

ANSYS® Workbench Environment

The ANSYS
Workbench Environment is a new-generation solution from ANSYS that provides powerful methods for interacting with the ANSYS solver functionality. This environment provides a unique integration with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems enabling
bi-directional interaction between the CAD model and the analytical solution


provided by the ANSYS Workbench Environment. This parametric association enhances the product design process, allowing shorter product development cycles.
This capability is now available for all ANSYS products.

ANSYS® ICEM CFD Suite

ICEM CFD software
products consist of geometry acquisition, mesh generation, post-processing, and mesh optimization tools. ICEM CFD products are the only universal pre-processor for analysis including Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD)
and other Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) applications. The major products in this suite include ICEM CFD, the leading software for 3-D grid generation for CFD and ICEPAK, an electronics cooling simulation system created in collaboration with
Fluent, Inc. The ICEM CFD products interface with all of the main CAD products and have translators to over 100 solvers.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 4, 2003, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire CFX, a leading supplier of computational fluid dynamics software and services, for a purchase price of approximately $21
million in cash. The acquisition was completed in February 2003.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The Company
makes significant investments in research and development and emphasizes accelerated new product releases. The Company’s product development strategy centers on ongoing development and innovation of new technologies to increase productivity and
provide solutions that customers can integrate into enterprise-wide engineering systems. The Company’s product development efforts focus on extensions of the full product line with new functional modules, further integration with CAD and
Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products, and the development of new products. The Company’s products run on the most widely used engineering computing platforms and operating systems, including Windows, Linux and most UNIX
workstations.

During 2002, the Company completed the following major product development activities and releases:

•

The release of ANSYS Workbench Environment 6.1, an enhanced
version of the Company’s new generation simulation product. The Workbench Environment evolved from the DesignSpace product, which allows product designers and engineers to quickly move their designs through the product development cycle. This
release adds a new module, Analysis Geometry Processor, for geometric modeling to prepare CAD models for simulation analysis and a new module, DesignXplorer, for the parametric optimization of simulations and immediate feedback on design
modifications.

•

The release of ANSYS 6.1, a new and enhanced version of the Company’s flagship multiphysics product, and all component products. This release incorporates a
new User Interface for improved ease of use, structural nonlinear capabilities for the simulation of gaskets, modeling of viscoelasticity, modeling of cyclic symmetric structures, which is critical to the rotating machinery and turbine industries,
and automatic fluid structure interactions for the analysis of coupled fluid and structural physics.

•

The introduction of ICEM CFD CART3D which commercializes the NASA developed code for inviscid analysis of external and
internal flow simulations. The CART3D product is integrated within the ICEM CFD product suite.

•

The release of ANSYS 7.0 simulation software for both the ANSYS Classic and Workbench Environments.

•

The flagship product is now
referred to as the ANSYS Classic Environment. The ANSYS Classic Environment is enhanced to provide new features including more nonlinear materials, additional contact functionality, rigid constraints, and reduced order modeling for
micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) simulations. Additionally, the customer may now choose whether to work in the ANSYS Classic or the ANSYS Workbench Environment.

•

This release brings a tighter integration of the two product lines. The ANSYS Workbench
Environment exposes more of the functionality of ANSYS Classic through the ‘applet’ command processors. This enables access to a variety of features such as modal and harmonic analysis, nonlinear material properties, and the powerful APDL
programming language. Additionally, the ANSYS Workbench Environment is now available on Sun and HP Unix workstations in addition to Windows workstations.


•

The introduction of a new module featuring Series Xpansion Variational Design Technology for the ANSYS Classic Environment. The FEMXplorer module allows users to
perform quick and accurate “what if” scenarios with one solution instead of multiple solutions as with traditional design of experiments methods. FEMXplorer’s proprietary Series Xpansion technology offers the capacity to study,
quantify, and graph the structural analysis response to alternative design parameters for linear elastic static analyses.

•

The introduction of DesignXplorer, which offers dynamic interaction with the design envelope. Utilizing advanced parametric
control, DesignXplorer provides instantaneous feedback on all proposed design modifications in the design process, significantly decreasing the number of iterations. This product also includes an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

•

The introduction
of AI*NASTRAN 1.0 developed through a strategic OEM partnership with Schaeffer Automated Simulation LLC. Built from the original NASA NASTRAN source code, AI*NASTRAN is the ideal tool for extremely large and complex problems. AI*NASTRAN contains
many enhancements of the NASA code such as increased problem size limits, upgraded element technology, increased solver speeds, streamlined program architecture, and expanded platform support.

The Company’s total research and development expenses were $19.6 million, $16.9 million and $14.5 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, or 21.5%, 19.9% and 19.5% of total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company’s product development staff consisted of 167 full time employees, most of whom hold advanced degrees and have industry experience in engineering, mathematics, computer science or related disciplines.

The Company uses multi-functional teams to develop its products and develops them simultaneously on multiple platforms to reduce subsequent porting costs. In addition to developing source code, these
teams create and perform highly automated software verification tests; develop on-line documentation and support for the products; implement development enhancement tools, software configuration management and product licensing processes; and
conduct regression tests of ANSYS products for all supported platforms.

PRODUCT QUALITY

In
accordance with the ISO 9001:2000 certification for its quality system, the Company’s employees perform all product development and support tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions for the ANSYS®
Simulation Suite, ANSYS® Physics Verticals and ANSYS® Workbench Environment product lines. These plans define for each project the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. To
ensure that the Company meets or surpasses the IS0 9001 standards, the Company establishes quality plans for all products and services, subjects product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification and selects development subcontractors in
accordance with processes established under the Company’s quality system.

SALES AND MARKETING

The Company distributes and supports its products through its global ANSYS Support Distributor (“ASD”) and reseller network, as well as through its own direct sales offices. This network provides the Company with a cost-effective,
highly specialized channel of distribution and technical support. Approximately 51% of the Company’s total revenue in 2002 was derived through the ASD and reseller network.

At December 31, 2002, the ASD network consisted of 30 independent distributors covering 37 countries, including 13 in North America, 6 in Europe and 11 throughout the Asia-Pacific region and the remainder of the world. The ASDs sell ANSYS and
DesignSpace products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services and provide the first line of ANSYS technical support. The Company’s ASD certification process helps to ensure
that each ASD has the ongoing capacity to adequately represent the Company’s expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support.

The Company also has a direct sales management infrastructure in place to develop an enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide major account strategy. The sales management organization also
functions as a focal point for requests to ANSYS from the ASD and reseller channel, and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices. As of December 31, 2002, a Vice President of Global Sales and
Services, with a supporting North American Vice President of Sales, a European Vice President of Sales, and an International Vice President of Sales, headed the Company’s sales management organization. These senior


members of sales management were supported by Regional Sales Directors, devoted to the overall management of stated sales territories, Strategic Account
Managers, devoted to specific major accounts within those territories, and Direct Territory Sales Representatives, devoted to sales in specific geographic regions.

During 2002,
the Company continued to invest in its existing domestic and international strategic sales offices and established a new sales office in France. In total, the Company’s direct sales offices employ 95 persons, who are responsible for the sales,
marketing initiatives and administrative activities in those geographic areas designed to support the Company’s overall revenue growth and market share expansion strategies.

During 2002, the Company also continued to expand the reseller channel for both its ANSYS and DesignSpace products. This channel complements the ASD network by establishing a broader user base for the Company’s products and services. As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had signed agreements with more than 200 resellers. The resellers are required to have appropriately trained marketing and technical personnel.

The Company’s products have an installed base of approximately 80,000 seats at commercial sites and approximately 129,000 seats at university sites worldwide. The Company’s products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from
small consulting firms to the world’s largest industrial companies. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2002.

Information with
respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Annual
Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2002 (“2002 Annual Report to Stockholders”), which financial statements are included in Exhibit 13.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS

The Company has established and continues to pursue strategic
alliances with advanced technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors, specialized application developers, CAD and PLM providers. The Company believes these relationships allow accelerated incorporation of advanced
technology into the ANSYS, DesignSpace, AI*NASTRAN and ICEM CFD products, provide access to important new markets, expand the Company’s sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD
systems.

The Company has technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, Parametric Technology Corporation, Dassault Systemes and Electronic
Data Systems to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and ANSYS products.

The Company has
established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware, including Hewlett-Packard, SGI, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Dell, Intel and various graphics card vendors. These relationships typically provide the Company with joint marketing
opportunities such as advertising, events and Internet links with the hardware partner’s home page. In addition, the Company receives reduced equipment costs and software porting support to ensure that the Company’s software products are
certified to run on various hardware platforms.

The Company’s Enhanced Solution Partner Program actively encourages specialized developers of niche software solutions to use
ANSYS as a development platform for their applications. In most cases, the sale of the Enhanced Solution Partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ANSYS product.

The Company has a software license agreement with Livermore Software Technology Corporation (“LSTC”) under which LSTC has provided LS-DYNA software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulation
in the automotive and other industries. Under this arrangement, LSTC assists in the integration of the LS/DYNA software with the Company’s pre- and post-processing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share
of revenue from sales of ANSYS/LS-DYNA.

The Company has a software license agreement with International Technology Group, Inc. (ITI) under which ITI provides CADfix software and
associated tools and utilities aimed at improving the success of transferring geometry from multiple CAD programs to ANSYS software products. Under this agreement, ITI assists in the integration of CADfix software with the Company’s products
and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of CADfix for ANSYS.


The Company has developed Icepak, a CFD application for thermal management of electronic enclosures, in cooperation with Fluent, Inc. Under this agreement,
the product is distributed by Fluent, Inc. and royalties are paid to the Company.

COMPETITION

The
CAD, CAE and computer-aided manufacturing (“CAM”) markets are intensely competitive. In the traditional CAE market, the Company’s primary competitors include MSC.Software Corporation and ABAQUS, Inc. (formerly Hibbitt, Karlsson and
Sorensen, Inc.). The Company also faces competition from smaller vendors of specialized analysis applications in fields such as computational fluid dynamics. In addition, certain integrated CAD and PLM suppliers such as Parametric Technology
Corporation, Electronic Data Systems Corporation and Dassault Systemes provide varying levels of design analysis, optimization and verification capabilities as part of their product offerings. The entrance of new competitors would likely intensify
competition in all or a portion of the overall CAD, CAE and CAM markets. Some of the Company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have
well-established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. It also is possible that alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or that competition will increase as a result of
software industry consolidation. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which would materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

The Company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its market include ease of use; breadth and depth of functionality; flexibility;
quality; ease of integration into CAD systems; file compatibility across computer platforms; range of supported computer platforms; performance; price and cost of ownership; customer service and support; company reputation and financial viability;
and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Although the Company believes that it currently competes effectively with respect to such factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its competitive position against
current and potential competitors. There also can be no assurance that CAD software companies will not develop their own analysis software, acquire analysis software from companies other than the Company or otherwise discontinue their relationships
with the Company. If any of these events occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES

The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license
agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses
for the use of the Company’s products, which are typically nontransferable. Although the Company distributes its products through the ASDs and the reseller channel, license agreements for the Company’s products are directly between the
Company and end users. Use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the customer obtains a site license for its use of the software. Software security measures are also employed to prevent
unauthorized use of the Company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software. Customers may either purchase a paid-up perpetual license of the technology with the
right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and updates, or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades.

For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on “click-wrapped” licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of certain jurisdictions is uncertain.

The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The Company has obtained federal trademark protection for ANSYS and
DesignSpace. The Company has also obtained trademark registrations of ANSYS and DesignSpace in a number of foreign countries and is in the process of seeking such registration in other foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded a
patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based reporting technology.

The employees of the Company have signed covenant agreements under which they have agreed
not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information, or to engage in or become connected with any business which is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world, while employed by the Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods
thereafter), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of


the Company. In addition, the Company requires all ASDs and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company’s trade secrets and other
proprietary information.

Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the Company’s technology will not occur. Further, there can be no
assurance that copyright and trade secret protection will be available for the Company’s products in certain countries, or that restrictions on competition will be enforceable.

The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product
enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available.

The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim in the future such
infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the
Company’s market segment grow and the functionality of products in different market segments overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require the
Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company.

BACKLOG

The Company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement. Accordingly, the Company
does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 450 full-time employees. At that date, there were also approximately 20 contract personnel and co-op students providing ongoing development services and technical
support. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
