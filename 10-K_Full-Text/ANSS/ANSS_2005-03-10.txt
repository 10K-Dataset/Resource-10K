, ICEM CFD

TM

, and CADOE

TM

products through a global
network of channel partners, in addition to its own direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. It is the Company’s intention to continue to maintain this mixed sales and distribution model.

The Company operates as one segment, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

.” Given the integrated approach to the problem-solving needs of the Company’s customers, a single sale of software may contain components
from multiple product areas. Additionally, the Company applies an integrated approach to development whereby best-in-class technology is utilized across all product lines, regardless of the product line from which such technology was originally
developed. There is no means by which the Company can provide accurate historical (or current) reporting among its ANSYS Simulation Suite, ANSYS Workbench, ANSYS ICEM CFD Suite, and ANSYS CFX Suite or any other product-line segmentation. Disclosure
of such information is impracticable.

The Company’s major product lines
are described as follows:

ANSYS
Simulation Suite

Incorporating design simulation and virtual prototyping
into a product development process is critical to minimize costs and improve time-to-market. With the ANSYS Simulation Suite, you can determine real-world structural, thermal, electromagnetic and fluid-flow behavior of 3-D product designs, including
the effects of multiple physics when they are coupled together for added accuracy and reliability.

ANSYS Workbench

The ANSYS Workbench is a new-generation solution from ANSYS that provides powerful methods for interacting with the ANSYS solver functionality. This environment provides
a unique integration with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems enabling bi-directional interaction between the CAD model and the analytical solution provided by the ANSYS Workbench environment. This parametric association enhances the product design
process, allowing shorter product development cycles.


ANSYS ICEM CFD Suite

ICEM CFD software products consist of geometry acquisition, mesh generation,
post-processing, and mesh optimization tools. ICEM CFD products provide best-in-class tools for universal pre-processing for analysis, including Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) and other Computer-Aided Engineering
(CAE) applications. The major products in this suite include ICEM CFD, the leading software for 3-D grid generation for CFD, and AI*Environment, a high powered meshing pre- and post-processor for FEA. The ICEM CFD products interface with all of the
main CAD products and have translators to over 100 solvers.

ANSYS CFX Suite

CFD has become an
integral part of the engineering design and analysis environment of many companies because of its ability to predict the performance of new designs or processes before they are ever manufactured or implemented. CFX uses world-leading technology such
as a coupled multigrid solver that solves the full system of hydrodynamic equations simultaneously. This robust methodology, in addition to providing industry-leading accuracy, is also the basis for unequalled parallel computing efficiency, allowing
companies to solve these computationally intensive problems in less time than ever before.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 26,
2003, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in certain entities and assets (hereinafter collectively referred to as “CFX”) for a purchase price of approximately $21.7 million in cash. CFX is a leading supplier of CFD software and
services. By acquiring CFX, ANSYS broadened the scope of engineering physics solutions it can offer to its customers and gained access to new customers and geographic territories.

On January 5, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Century Dynamics, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Century
Dynamics”), a leading provider of sophisticated simulation software for solving linear, nonlinear and explicit, as well as multi-body hydro-dynamics problems, for an initial purchase price of approximately $5.6 million in cash. In addition, the
agreement provides for future payments contingent upon the attainment of certain performance criteria. The acquisition of Century Dynamics expands the Company’s product offerings and allows it to deliver a more complete and comprehensive
solution to meet its customers needs.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The Company makes significant investments in research and development and emphasizes
accelerated new integrated product releases. The Company’s product development strategy centers on ongoing development and innovation of new technologies to increase productivity and provide solutions that customers can integrate into
enterprise-wide engineering systems. The Company’s product development efforts focus on extensions of the full product line with new functional modules, further integration with CAD and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products, and the
development of new products. The Company’s products run on the most widely used engineering computing platforms and operating systems, including Windows, Linux and most UNIX workstations.

During 2004, the Company completed the following major product development activities and
releases (in chronological order):

•

The release of ANSYS 8.1, featuring new high-end simulation capabilities, as well as design process enhancements. ANSYS 8.1 includes advances in parallel computing, solver

•

The release of ANSYS CFX 5.7, which continues the rapid advancement of CFD core technology development and leverages the ANSYS technology to increase integration into the
engineering design cycle. CFX-5.7 can include ANSYS DesignModeler for geometry creation or CAD import along with a special version of ANSYS ICEM CFD, which provides a proven meshing capability that is well known for its exceptional robustness when
applied to industrial CAD models. CFX-5.7 includes many extensions in physical models, permitting a much broader range of applications.

•

The release of ANSYS ICEM CFD 5.0, featuring the integration of the hex meshing and post-processing modules. The integration provides a more streamlined user experience, while
maintaining the large amount of control desired by users. This release includes significant functional improvements to geometry creation, model diagnosis and repair, the meshing modules, mesh editing and visualization.


•

The release of AI*Environment 5.0, an upgrade to the pre- and post-processing software dedicated to structural analysis, that can be run within the ANSYS Workbench as the Advanced
Meshing Tab. The upgrade provides users with direct access to their CAD system that allows the cleanest path of CAD geometry to a high-quality mesh.

•

The release of ANSYS CFX-TurboGrid 2.2, a specialized software tool used by rotating machinery designers and engineers. This version of CFX-Turbo Grid brings a new level of speed,
automation, flexibility and high mesh quality to the product for a wide range of axial and radial turbomachinery bladed row components.

•

The release of ANSYS 9.0, which integrates technical capabilities from each of the Company’s major product lines, is the latest version of the Company’s industry-leading
CAE simulation software platform. This software release features electromagnetic, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and mesh creation technologies integrated within the ANSYS Workbench product development environment. ANSYS 9.0 extends core
features and provides powerful robust design capabilities. In addition, ANSYS 9.0 is ported to the AMD Opteron processor which allows companies to preserve their investments in 32-bit applications, while providing a transition path to 64-bit
computing for those projects demanding high-performance capabilities.

The Company’s total research and development expenses were $26.3 million, $23.8 million and $19.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, or 19.5%, 21.0% and 21.5% of total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s
product development staff consisted of approximately 200 full time employees, most of whom hold advanced degrees and have industry experience in engineering, mathematics, computer science or related disciplines.

The Company uses multi-functional teams to develop its products and develops them
simultaneously on multiple platforms to reduce subsequent porting costs. In addition to developing source code, these teams create and perform highly automated software verification tests; develop on-line documentation and support for the products;
implement development enhancement tools, software configuration management and product licensing processes; and conduct regression tests of ANSYS products for all supported platforms.

PRODUCT QUALITY

The Company’s employees perform all product development and support tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions. These plans define
for each project the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. The ANSYS

®

Simulation Suite and ANSYS

®

Workbench are certified according to ISO 9001:2000 standards. To ensure that the Company meets or surpasses the IS0 9001 standards, the Company
establishes quality plans for all products and services, subjects product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification and selects development subcontractors in accordance with processes established under the Company’s quality
system.

SALES AND MARKETING

The Company distributes and supports its products through a global network of channel
partners, as well as through its own direct sales offices. This network provides the Company with a cost-effective, highly specialized channel of distribution and technical support. Approximately 43% of the Company’s total revenue in 2004 was
derived through the indirect sales channel.

The channel partners sell ANSYS
products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services and provide the first line of ANSYS technical support. The Company’s channel partner certification process helps to ensure
that each channel partner has the ongoing capacity to adequately represent the Company’s expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support.

The Company also has a direct sales management infrastructure in place to develop an
enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide major account strategy. The sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests to ANSYS from the independent channel partners, and provides additional
support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices. A Vice President of Sales and Support heads the Company’s sales management organization.

During 2004, the Company continued to invest in its existing domestic and international strategic sales offices. In total, the
Company’s direct sales offices employ approximately 120 persons, who are responsible for the sales, marketing initiatives and administrative activities in those geographic areas designed to support the Company’s overall revenue growth and
expansion strategies.


During 2004, the Company also continued to expand its independent channel partner network, including its reseller
network. The reseller network complements the larger ANSYS channel partners by establishing a broader user base for the Company’s products and services. The resellers are required to have appropriately trained marketing and technical personnel.

The Company’s products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from
small consulting firms to the world’s largest industrial companies. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2004.

Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section entitled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2004 (“2004 Annual Report to Stockholders”), which financial
statements are included in Exhibit 13.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS

The Company has established and continues to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors, specialized
application developers, and CAD and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) providers. The Company believes these relationships allow accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into the ANSYS, ICEM CFD and CFX products, provide access to important
new customers, expand the Company’s sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD and PLM systems.

The Company has technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, Dassault Systemes, Parametric Technology
Corporation, Solid Edge, Solid Works and UGS PLM Solutions, to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and ANSYS products.

The Company has established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware,
including Hewlett-Packard, SGI, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Dell, Intel, Fujitsu America and various graphics card vendors. These relationships typically provide the Company with joint marketing opportunities such as advertising, events and Internet
links with the hardware partner’s home page. In addition, the Company receives reduced equipment costs and software porting support to ensure that the Company’s software products are certified to run on various hardware platforms.

The Company’s Enhanced Solution Partner Program actively encourages
specialized developers of niche software solutions to use ANSYS technology as a development platform for their applications. In most cases, the sale of the Enhanced Solution Partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ANSYS product.

The Company has a software license agreement with Livermore Software
Technology Corporation (“LSTC”) under which LSTC has provided LS-DYNA software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulation in the automotive and other industries. Under this arrangement, LSTC assists
in the integration of the LS-DYNA software with the Company’s pre- and post-processing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA combined product.

The Company has an agreement with Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk”) under which Autodesk
licenses ANSYS part-level stress and resonant frequency simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of the Autodesk Inventor Professional 9.0 product and future releases.


COMPETITION

The Company believes that principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of
integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and
effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Although the Company believes that it currently performs effectively with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to perform effectively with respect
to all or any of these factors. There also can be no assurance that other software suppliers and customers will not develop their own software, or acquire software from suppliers other than the Company, or otherwise discontinue their relationships
with the Company. If any of these events occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

The Company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services. Some of the Company’s current
and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. These competitive pressures may
result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES

The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other
contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the Company’s
products, which are typically nontransferable. License agreements for the Company’s products are directly between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the
customer obtains a site license for its use of the software. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the Company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting
unauthorized reproduction of the software. Customers may either purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and updates, or may lease the product on an annual basis for a
fee which includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades.

For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on “click-wrapped” licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain.

The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as
unpublished copyrighted work. The Company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ANSYS and CFX in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its
Web-based reporting technology.

Employees of the Company have signed covenant
agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information, and where legally permitted, restricts engagement in or connection with any business which is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world,
while employed by the Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel
partners and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information.

Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the Company’s technology will not occur. Further, there can be no assurance that
copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret protection will be available for the Company’s products in certain countries, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the
Company will be enforceable.

The software development industry is
characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product
maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available.

The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance,
however, that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to
such claims as the number of products and competitors in the Company’s market segment grow and the functionality of products in different market segments overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company.


BACKLOG

The Company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement. Accordingly, the Company does not
believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2004, the
Company had approximately 550 full-time employees. At that date, there were also contract personnel and co-op students providing ongoing development services and technical support. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is
good.

The Company’s executive offices and those related to domestic product development, marketing, production and administration are located in a 107,000 square feet office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which
was leased for an annual rent of approximately $1,241,000 in 2004. The Company and its subsidiaries also lease office space in various locations throughout the world. The Company owns substantially all equipment used in its facilities. Management
believes that its facilities allow for sufficient space to support not only its present needs, but also allow for expansion and growth as the business may require in the foreseeable future.

In the opinion of management, the Company’s properties and its equipment are in good
operating condition and are adequate for the Company’s current needs. The Company does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings from time to
time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. These proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various taxing authorities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that these
matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. Management believes, after consulting with legal counsel, that the ultimate liabilities, if any, resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s financial
position, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS
TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of
security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004.

reference to pages 11 through 26 of the Company’s 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders, including the “Important Factors Regarding Future Results.”

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As the Company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment
obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had a British Pound-denominated intercompany loan
related to the CFX acquisition with one of its subsidiaries. This note was recorded as a receivable on a U.S. company and was subject to foreign currency translation risk between the British Pound and the U.S. Dollar. Monthly translations to the
current spot-rate are recorded in the statement of income. As of December 31, 2004, a U.K. subsidiary had a U.S. dollar cash balance, which provided a natural hedge against the intercompany loan thereby substantially eliminating foreign currency
exchange risk on this loan.

Based on the nature of the Company’s
business, it has no direct exposure to commodity price risk.


ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to pages 27 through 45 of the Company’s 2004 Annual Report to
Stockholders, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 13.1.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN

None.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating
to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the certifying officers by others within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries during the period covered by this report.

The Company has a Disclosure Review Committee to assist in the quarterly evaluation of the
Company’s internal disclosure controls and procedures and in the review of the Company’s periodic filings under the Exchange Act. The membership of the Disclosure Review Committee consists of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, Controller, General Counsel, Treasurer, Vice President of Sales and Support, Vice President of Human Resources and Business Unit General Managers. This committee is advised by external counsel, particularly on SEC-related
matters. Additionally, other members of the Company’s global management team advise the committee with respect to disclosure via a sub-certification process.

The Company believes based on its knowledge that the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. The Company cannot provide assurance that new problems will not be found in the
future, nor does it expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or its internal controls, will prevent all errors and all fraud because no system can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within ANSYS have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some person or by collusion of two or more people. The Company is committed to
both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance.

From time to time, the Company reviews the disclosure controls and procedures, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business. As of the
end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ANSYS’ disclosure controls and procedures by the Company. Based on that evaluation, the Company has concluded that its
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
based upon the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2004.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm. Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on the Company’s controls over financial reporting. The report is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no significant changes in the Company’s
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2004.
