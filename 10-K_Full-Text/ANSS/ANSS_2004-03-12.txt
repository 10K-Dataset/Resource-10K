PART
I

ITEM 1: BUSINESS

ANSYS, Inc. develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and technologies
widely used by engineers and designers across a broad spectrum of industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, electronics and biomedical. Headquartered at Southpointe in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, the Company employs approximately 600
people and focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to
final-stage testing and validation. The Company distributes its ANSYS

®

,
DesignSpace

®

, ICEM CFD Engineering and CADOE

®

products through a global network of channel partners, in addition to its own direct sales offices in strategic, global locations.
The Company’s CFX® products are currently distributed primarily through direct sales offices located in seven countries throughout the world.

The Company’s major product lines are described as follows:

ANSYS® Simulation Suite

Incorporating design simulation and virtual prototyping into a product development process is critical to minimize costs and improve time-to-market. With the ANSYS
Simulation Suite, you can determine real-world structural, thermal, electromagnetic and fluid-flow behavior of 3-D product designs, including the effects of multiple physics when they are coupled together for added accuracy and reliability.

ANSYS® Physics Verticals

ANSYS Physics Verticals may be used independently or in conjunction with other ANSYS
products, such as ANSYS Mechanical

™

, to enable an
even more comprehensive simulation of real-world phenomena. These products are focused towards specific industries to solve problems such as electromagnetic interference, antenna design, aerodynamic design, crash dynamics, metal forming and product
design reliability.


ANSYS® Workbench Environment

The ANSYS Workbench Environment is a new-generation solution from ANSYS that provides powerful methods for interacting with the ANSYS solver
functionality. This environment provides a unique integration with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems enabling bi-directional interaction between the CAD model and the analytical solution provided by the ANSYS Workbench Environment. This parametric
association enhances the product design process, allowing shorter product development cycles. This capability is now available for all ANSYS products.

ANSYS® ICEM CFD Suite

ICEM CFD software products consist of geometry acquisition, mesh generation, post-processing, and mesh optimization tools. ICEM CFD products are the only universal
pre-processor for analysis including Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) and other Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) applications. The major products in this suite include ICEM CFD, the leading software for 3-D grid
generation for CFD and ICEPAK, an electronics cooling simulation system created in collaboration with Fluent, Inc. The ICEM CFD products interface with all of the main CAD products and have translators to over 100 solvers.

ANSYS CFX Suite

CFD has become an integral part of the engineering design and analysis environment of many companies because of its ability to predict the
performance of new designs or processes before they are ever manufactured or implemented. CFX uses world-leading technology such as a coupled multigrid solver that solves the full system of hydrodynamic equations simultaneously. This methodology, in
addition to robustly providing accurate results, is also the basis for industry-leading parallel efficiency, allowing companies to solve these computationally intensive problems in less time than ever before.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 26, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in certain entities and assets (hereinafter collectively referred to as
“CFX”) for a purchase price of approximately $21.7 million in cash. CFX is a leading supplier of CFD software and services. By acquiring CFX, ANSYS broadened the scope of engineering physics solutions it can offer to its customers and
gained access to new customers and geographic territories.

CFX represents the
Company’s second CFD acquisition. The Company had previously acquired ICEM CFD Engineering in August 2000. CFX’s mathematical representations for simulating the physics involved in CFD applications complement the pre- and post-processing
capabilities of ICEM CFD Engineering.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The Company makes significant investments in research and development and emphasizes
accelerated new product releases. The Company’s product development strategy centers on ongoing development and innovation of new technologies to increase productivity and provide solutions that customers can integrate into enterprise-wide
engineering systems. The Company’s product development efforts focus on extensions of the full product line with new functional modules, further integration with CAD and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products, and the development of new
products. The Company’s products run on the most widely used engineering computing platforms and operating systems, including Windows, Linux and most UNIX workstations.

During 2003, the Company completed the following major product development activities and releases:

•

The release of CFX-Turbogrid

TM

TM

provides users with a better way to approach the early stages of design for large, CAD-intensive
structural products.

•

The release of AI*Environment

TM

, a robust pre-
and post-processing tool to support complex and advanced simulation problems faced by engineering analysts. By applying the Company’s ICEM CFD Engineering technology to the structural modeling problem, AI*Environment is designed to provide a
direct path from CAD to analysis and reduce time and efforts required in preparing data for large simulations.

•

The release of ANSYS 8.0, the latest version of the Company’s industry-leading CAE simulation software platform, featuring the most comprehensive enterprise solution for
multiphysics analysis, as well as a new distributed solver, contact formulation, automated simulation, integration, parametric mesh capabilities and other technology advancements. This release also enables companies to better manage and reuse legacy
data.

The Company’s total research and development expenses
were $23.8 million, $19.6 million and $16.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, or 21.0%, 21.5% and 19.9% of total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s product development staff consisted of approximately 210 full time
employees, most of whom hold advanced degrees and have industry experience in engineering, mathematics, computer science or related disciplines.

The Company uses multi-functional teams to develop its products and develops them simultaneously on multiple platforms to reduce subsequent porting costs. In addition to
developing source code, these teams create and perform highly automated software verification tests; develop on-line documentation and support for the products; implement development enhancement tools, software configuration management and product
licensing processes; and conduct regression tests of ANSYS products for all supported platforms.

PRODUCT QUALITY

In accordance with the
ISO 9001:2000 certification for its quality system, the Company’s employees perform all product development and support tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions for the ANSYS

®

Simulation Suite, ANSYS

®

Physics Verticals, ANSYS

®

Workbench Environment and the ANSYS CFX product lines. These plans define for each
project the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. To ensure that the Company meets or surpasses the IS0 9001 standards, the Company establishes quality plans for all products and
services, subjects product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification and selects development subcontractors in accordance with processes established under the Company’s quality system.

SALES AND MARKETING

The Company distributes and supports its products through a global network of channel partners, as well as through its own direct sales
offices. This network provides the Company with a cost-effective, highly specialized channel of distribution and technical support. Approximately 45% of the Company’s total revenue in 2003 was derived through the indirect sales channel.

The channel partners sell ANSYS products to new customers, expand
installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services and provide the first line of ANSYS technical support. The Company’s channel partner certification process helps to ensure that each channel partner has the
ongoing capacity to adequately represent the Company’s expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support.

The Company also has a direct sales management infrastructure in place to develop an enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to
implement a worldwide major account strategy. The sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests to ANSYS from the independent channel partners, and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence
of direct sales offices. As of December 31, 2003, a Vice President of Sales and Marketing and a Vice President of Sales and Services headed the Company’s sales management organization. They were supported by a North American Channel Manager, a
North American Direct Sales Manager, a European Vice President of Sales, an International Vice President of Sales and Regional Business Center Managers.

During 2003, the Company continued to invest in its existing domestic and international strategic sales offices. In total, the Company’s direct sales offices employ
approximately 120 persons, who are responsible for the sales, marketing initiatives and administrative activities in those geographic areas designed to support the Company’s overall revenue growth and expansion strategies.


During 2003, the Company also continued to expand its independent channel partner network, including its reseller
network. The reseller network complements the larger ANSYS channel partners by establishing a broader user base for the Company’s products and services. The resellers are required to have appropriately trained marketing and technical personnel.

The Company’s products have an installed base of approximately 88,000
seats at commercial sites and approximately 132,000 seats at university sites worldwide. The Company’s products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small consulting firms to the world’s largest industrial companies. No
single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2003.

Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2003 (“2003 Annual Report to Stockholders”), which financial statements are included in Exhibit 13.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated
herein by reference.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS

The Company has established and continues to pursue strategic alliances
with advanced technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors, specialized application developers, CAD and PLM providers. The Company believes these relationships allow accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into the
ANSYS, DesignSpace, ICEM CFD and CFX products, provide access to important new customers, expand the Company’s sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD systems.

The Company has technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as
Autodesk, Parametric Technology Corporation, Dassault Systemes and UGS PLM Solutions to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and ANSYS products.

The Company has established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware,
including Hewlett-Packard, SGI, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Dell, Intel and various graphics card vendors. These relationships typically provide the Company with joint marketing opportunities such as advertising, events and Internet links with the
hardware partner’s home page. In addition, the Company receives reduced equipment costs and software porting support to ensure that the Company’s software products are certified to run on various hardware platforms.

The Company’s Enhanced Solution Partner Program actively encourages specialized
developers of niche software solutions to use ANSYS technology as a development platform for their applications. In most cases, the sale of the Enhanced Solution Partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ANSYS product.

The Company has a software license agreement with Livermore Software Technology Corporation
(“LSTC”) under which LSTC has provided LS-DYNA software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulation in the automotive and other industries. Under this arrangement, LSTC assists in the integration of
the LS-DYNA software with the Company’s pre- and post-processing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA combined product.

The Company has a software license agreement with International Technology Group, Inc. (ITI)
under which ITI provides CADfix software and associated tools and utilities aimed at improving the success of transferring geometry from multiple CAD programs to ANSYS software products. Under this agreement, ITI assists in the integration of CADfix
software with the Company’s products and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of CADfix for ANSYS.

The Company has developed Icepak, a CFD application for thermal management of electronic enclosures, in cooperation with Fluent, Inc. Under this agreement, the product is
distributed by Fluent, Inc. and royalties are paid to the Company.

COMPETITION

The Company continues to experience intense
competition across all markets for its products and services. Some of the Company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established
relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.


The Company believes that principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of
functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and cost of ownership, customer service and support,
company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Although the Company believes that it currently performs effectively with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to continue to perform effectively with respect to all or any of these factors. There also can be no assurance that other software suppliers and customers will not develop their own software, or acquire software from suppliers other than the
Company, or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the Company. If any of these events occur, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES

The Company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret,
copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company distributes its software under software license agreements that
grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the Company’s products, which are typically nontransferable. License agreements for the Company’s products are directly between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software is
restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the customer obtains a site license for its use of the software. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the Company’s software and the licensed
software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software. Customers may either purchase a paid-up perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support
and updates, or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades.

For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on “click-wrapped” licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of
certain jurisdictions is uncertain.

The Company also seeks to protect the
source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The Company has obtained federal trademark protection for ANSYS and DesignSpace. The Company has also obtained trademark registrations of ANSYS and DesignSpace in a
number of foreign countries and is in the process of seeking such registration in other foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based reporting technology.

Employees of the Company have signed covenant agreements under which they have agreed not to
disclose trade secrets or confidential information, or to engage in or become connected with any business which is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world, while employed by the Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods
thereafter), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel partners and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the
Company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information.

Despite these
precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the Company’s technology will not occur. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright and trade secret protection will be available for the Company’s products in certain
countries, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the Company will be enforceable.

The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative
skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal
protections of its technology which may be available.

The Company does not
believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect
to current or future products. The Company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the Company’s market segment grow and the functionality of products in
different market segments overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or
licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company.


BACKLOG

The Company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement. Accordingly, the Company does not
believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had approximately 600 full-time employees. At that date, there were also approximately 20 contract personnel and co-op students providing ongoing development services and technical support. The Company believes that its relationship with its
employees is good.

ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

The Company’s executive offices and those related to product development, marketing,
production and administration are located in a 107,000 square feet office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which was leased for an annual rent of approximately $1,354,000 in 2003. The Company also leases office space in various locations
throughout the world. The Company’s subsidiaries lease office space for their operations as well. The Company owns substantially all equipment used in its facilities. Management believes that its facilities allow for sufficient space to support
not only its present needs, but also allow for expansion and growth as the business may require in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. These
proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various taxing authorities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. Management believes,
after consulting with legal counsel, that the ultimate liabilities, if any, resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2003.

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As the Company continues to
expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in currency exchange
rates from time to time may affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As of December 31, 2003 the Company had a British Pound-denominated intercompany loan related to the CFX acquisition with one of its subsidiaries. This note was recorded
as a receivable on a U.S. company and was subject to foreign currency translation risk between the British Pound and the U.S. Dollar. Monthly translations to the current spot-rate are recorded in the statement of income. As of December 31, 2003, a
U.K. subsidiary had a U.S. dollar cash balance, which provided a natural hedge against the intercompany loan thereby substantially eliminating foreign currency exchange risk on this loan.

Based on the nature of the Company’s business, it has no direct exposure to commodity price risk.

ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to pages 26 through 45 of
the Company’s 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN
AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the Company’s 2004 Proxy Statement and is set forth under “Independent Accountants” therein.


ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the certifying officers by
others within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries during the period covered by this report.

In 2002, the Company created a Disclosure Review Committee to assist in the quarterly evaluation of the Company’s internal disclosure controls and procedures and in the review of the Company’s periodic
filings under the Exchange Act. The membership of the Disclosure Review Committee consists of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, General Counsel, Treasurer, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Vice
President of Sales and Support, Vice President of Human Resources, Vice President of Marketing and Business Unit General Managers.

From time to time, the Company reviews the disclosure controls and procedures, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure
that the Company’s systems evolve with its business. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2003 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
