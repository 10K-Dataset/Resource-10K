and AUTODYN

®

products through a global network of channel partners, in addition to its own direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. It is the Company’s
intention to continue to maintain this mixed sales and distribution model.

The Company operates as one segment, as defined by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

.” Given the integrated approach to the problem-solving needs of the Company’s customers, a single sale of software may
contain components from multiple product areas and include combined technologies. There is no means by which the Company can provide accurate historical (or current) reporting among its various product-line segmentations. Disclosure of such
information is impracticable.

The Company’s product lines are used to produce solutions in the following primary
areas:

ANSYS Multiphysics™ Solutions

ANSYS Multiphysics solutions provides the analysis industry’s most advanced coupled physics technology, combining structural, thermal, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), acoustic and electromagnetic simulation
capabilities in a single software product. With the ANSYS Multiphysics solutions, users receive the core physics of the entire ANSYS simulation suite in one convenient package. Applications involve everything from rotating machines (motors and
alternators), sensors and actuators, power generators and transformer systems, and micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS).

ANSYS Mechanical™ Solutions

ANSYS Mechanical solutions offer best-in-class simulation tools for product design and optimization which
increase productivity, minimize physical prototyping and help deliver better and innovative products in less time. They offer solutions to tackle real world analysis problems by making product development less costly and more reliable. The ANSYS
family of core products offers a full depth of analysis tools from concept simulation to advanced analysis, and breadth of simulation capabilities from linear to nonlinear coupled physics analysis. They provide simulation tools for users from
designers to advanced analysts, providing a full complement of nonlinear analysis and linear dynamics solutions and the most comprehensive set of solvers available to tackle real world problems.


ANSYS Fluid Dynamics Solutions

Computational fluid dynamics has become an integral part of the engineering design and analysis environment of many companies who desire the ability to predict the
performance of new designs or processes before they are ever manufactured or implemented. CFD solutions from ANSYS, Inc. are based on the proven technology of ANSYS CFX software. Fluid dynamics is used in industries including aerospace, automotive,
chemical processing, power generation, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, biomedical, oil and gas, marine and many others. From ventilation comfort in large buildings to the tiniest scale in micro-pumps and nanotechnology, a wide range of
problems can be addressed due to the diverse nature of fluid dynamics. Expertise in assisting companies increase performance through simulation-driven design for pumps, fans, turbines, compressors and other rotating machinery has been incorporated
in all elements of ANSYS CFX software making it a leader in this field. Variations for combustion, reacting flows and radiation, among others, help provide the insight into equipment and processes required to increase production, improve longevity
and decrease waste.

ANSYS Electromagnetics Solutions

Electromagnetic simulations are critical to electrical and electronic product designs across many industries. ANSYS Electromagnetics solutions address the analysis needs of two broad, but distinct, electromagnetic
market segments: high frequency and low frequency. ANSYS Electromagnetics solutions are included in the ANSYS Multiphysics and ANSYS Emag products.

ANSYS Multiphysics “contains” ANSYS Emag and provides the most complete
electromagnetics solution available on the market today. It addresses the analysis needs of both low and high frequency electromagnetic markets.

ANSYS Design for Six Sigma Solutions

Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is an analysis technique used in determining the
extent to which uncertainties in the model affect the results of an analysis. Based on a probabilistic characterization, DFSS enables users to quantify the quality of their product, addressing issues such as minimizing warranty costs and quantifying
the reliability of the product.

ANSYS Fluid Structure Interaction Solutions

The ANSYS Fluid Structure Interaction solution provides the analysis industry’s most flexible and advanced coupled structural-fluid physics analysis tool.
Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is required for many industry applications such as biomedical (e.g. elastic artery modeling for stent design), aerofoil flutter and civil engineering (e.g. wind loading of structures). The ANSYS Fluid Structure
Interaction solution consists of two levels of fluid-structure coupling: basic FSI and advanced FSI. Basic FSI consists of entry level coupling between structural, electromagnetic and fluids suitable for steady state analysis. The coupling is file
based, uni-directional and involves using the result of one simulation as a load or boundary condition for a second simulation. Advanced FSI uses the ANSYS Multi-field™ solver to provide a true bi-directional FSI capability for time transient
or steady state analysis with moving / deforming geometry.

ANSYS Meshing Solutions

Meshing is an integral part of the computer-aided engineering analysis process. The mesh influences the accuracy, convergence and speed of the solution. More importantly,
the time it takes to create a mesh model is often a significant portion of the time it takes to get results from a computer-aided engineering solution. From automatic to highly crafted meshing, ANSYS, Inc. provides powerful pre- and post-processing
tools for mesh generation from any geometry source.

ANSYS Explicit Dynamics Solutions

Explicit Dynamics Solutions are addressed by ANSYS AUTODYN and ANSYS LS-DYNA. Simulations within this solution involve extremely short time durations, high deformations,
large strains, and fracture or complete material failure. Applications of explicit dynamics using ANSYS AUTODYN include defense, homeland security, space (hypervelocity impact) and other fast transient fluid-structure interactions. Applications for
ANSYS LS-DYNA include metal forming, drop testing and other consumer product testing.


BUSINESS ACQUISITION

On February 26, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the shares in certain entities and assets (hereinafter collectively referred to as “CFX”) for a purchase price of approximately $21.7 million in cash. CFX is a leading
supplier of CFD software and services. By acquiring CFX, ANSYS broadened the scope of engineering physics solutions it could offer to its customers and gained access to new customers and geographic territories.

On January 5, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Century Dynamics, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “CDI”), a leading provider of
sophisticated simulation software for solving linear, nonlinear and explicit, as well as multi-body hydro-dynamics problems, for an initial purchase price of approximately $5.1 million in cash. In addition, the agreement provided for a future cash
payment contingent upon the attainment of certain performance criteria, which is to be paid no later than March 22, 2006. This payment is estimated to be approximately $4.5 million and was accounted for as an addition to both goodwill and other
accrued expenses and liabilities in 2005. The acquisition of CDI expands the Company’s product offerings and allows it to deliver a more complete and comprehensive solution to its customers.

In October 2005, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Harvard Thermal, Inc. (hereafter “HTI”), a leader in thermal analysis software tools,
for an up-front purchase price of approximately $1.3 million in cash and stock. In addition, the acquisition agreement provides for future payments of up to $400,000, contingent upon the attainment of certain performance criteria. The acquisition of
HTI expands the Company’s product offerings and allows it to deliver a more complete and comprehensive simulation solution to its customers.

On
February 16, 2006, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fluent, Inc. (“Fluent”), a global provider of CFD-based computer-aided engineering software and services. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company
will issue 6,000,000 shares of its common stock and pay approximately $300 million in net cash to acquire Fluent, subject to certain adjustments at closing. The Company will use a combination of existing cash and approximately $200 million from
committed bank financing to fund the transaction. The acquisition of Fluent is expected to enhance the breadth, functionality, usability and interoperability of the ANSYS portfolio of simulation solutions. This will increase operational efficiency
and lower design and engineering costs for customers, and accelerate development and delivery of new and innovative products to the marketplace. Subject to customary closing conditions and the expiration or termination of the waiting periods under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2006.


PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The Company makes significant investments in research and development and emphasizes accelerated new integrated product releases. The Company’s product development strategy centers on ongoing development and innovation of new
technologies to increase productivity and provide engineering simulation solutions that customers can integrate into enterprise-wide product lifecycle management systems. The Company’s product development efforts focus on extensions of the full
product line with new functional modules, further integration with computer-aided design (CAD) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products, and the development of new products. The Company’s products run on the most widely used engineering
computing platforms and operating systems, including Windows, Linux and most UNIX workstations.

During 2005, the Company completed the following major
product development activities and releases (in chronological order):

•

The release of AUTODYN 6.0, which offers major gains in performance, ease-of-use, interoperability and fluid structure interaction (FSI) technology. AUTODYN 6.0 has increased levels
of flexibility through a new generation of finite element solvers, allowing shorter runtimes, larger models, and better accessibility to third-party finite element and CAD software. In addition, within this version, the multi-material CFD solvers
have been significantly enhanced, providing robustness and accuracy for an even wider range of complex applications.

•

The release of ANSYS 10.0, featuring integrated flexibility and design process enhancements, including performance upgrades and improved coupled physics technology in fluid
structure interaction. In addition to offering superior capabilities for complex FSI problems, ANSYS 10.0 features ANSYS BladeModeler, an efficient 3-D rotating machinery design tool for bladed components and ANSYS TurboGrid, a high quality
hexahedral meshing tool for blade design. Other developments within this version include thermal transients related to mechanical application, a new modal port definition related to high frequency electromagnetic, and the addition of gyroscopic
effects that enhance the performance for application of rotating structures.

•

The release of ANSYS CFX 10.0, which continues to build on integration within the ANSYS product family to provide superior analysis capabilities within an integrated engineering
environment. This release provides simultaneous, bi-directional transient coupling between the ANSYS and CFX solvers to allow the simulation of advanced fluid structure interaction. Development and release of core CFD technology also continued on a
range of new physical models, including the first-ever availability of a predictive transitional turbulence model in commercial CFD analysis software.

The release of ANSYS ICEM CFD / AI*Environment 10.0, featuring improved integration of meshing tools of ANSYS ICEM CFD / AI*Environment 5.0 and 5.1. This release brings advantages
to the ANSYS family of users by providing common meshing tools within the Workbench integration framework. Recent enhancements in the 10.0 version provide time-saving techniques to quickly simplify underhood models through shrinkwrapping, which
allows a user to generate a mesh on these complicated models in days rather than weeks. Additionally, the midsurfacing and welding tools have been greatly extended to help users quickly mesh large assemblies of sheet metal components.

•

The release of ASAS 14, which is structural finite element software for the offshore industry. ASAS introduces many new features, including a simple method for defining internal
tank loading for vessels. Additionally, the unique, nonlinear coupled wave-structure interaction facility has been enhanced with the addition of effective tension for curved tubular elements.


•

The release of AQWA 5.6, a hydrodynamic assessment software product. AQWA 5.6 introduces a number of ground breaking new features, including the ability to handle up to 50
interconnected structures, user defined multi-directional wave spectra and improved handling of irregular frequencies, as well as standing waves.

The Company’s total research and development expenses were $30.7 million, $26.3 million and $23.8 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, or 19.4%, 19.5% and 21.0% of total revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company’s product development staff consisted of approximately 230 full time employees, most of whom hold advanced degrees and have industry experience in engineering, mathematics, computer science or related disciplines.

The Company uses multi-functional teams to develop its products and develops them simultaneously on multiple platforms to reduce subsequent porting costs. In addition to
developing source code, these teams create and perform highly automated software verification tests; develop on-line documentation and support for the products; implement development enhancement tools, software configuration management and product
licensing processes; and conduct regression tests of ANSYS products for all supported platforms.

PRODUCT QUALITY

The Company’s employees perform all product development and support tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions. These plans define
for each project the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. The majority of software products are developed under a quality system which is certified to the ISO 9001:2000 standard. The
Company establishes quality plans for all products and services, subjects product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification, and selects development subcontractors in accordance with processes established under the Company’s
quality system.

SALES AND MARKETING

The Company
distributes and supports its products through a global network of channel partners, as well as through its own direct sales offices. This network provides the Company with a cost-effective, highly specialized channel of distribution and technical
support. Approximately 42% of the Company’s total revenue in 2005 was derived through the indirect sales channel.

The channel partners sell ANSYS
products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services and provide the first line of ANSYS technical support. The Company’s channel partner certification process helps to ensure
that each channel partner has the ongoing capacity to adequately represent the Company’s expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support.

The Company also has a direct sales management infrastructure in place to develop an enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide major account
strategy. The sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests to ANSYS from the independent channel partners and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices. A Vice
President of Sales and Support heads the Company’s sales management organization.

During 2005, the Company continued to invest in its existing
domestic and international strategic sales offices. In total, the Company’s direct sales offices employ approximately 130 persons, who are responsible for the sales, marketing initiatives and administrative activities in those geographic areas
designed to support the Company’s overall revenue growth and expansion strategies.

During 2005, the Company also continued to expand its independent
channel partner network, including its reseller network. The reseller network complements the larger ANSYS channel partners by establishing a broader user base for the Company’s products and services. The resellers are required to have
appropriately trained marketing, sales and technical personnel.

The Company’s products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small
consulting firms to the world’s largest industrial companies. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue in 2005.


Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2005 (“2005 Annual Report to
Stockholders”), which financial statements are included in Exhibit 13.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS

The Company has established and continues to pursue strategic alliances with advanced
technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors, specialized application developers and CAD and PLM providers. The Company believes these relationships allow accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into the
Company’s products, provide access to important new customers, expand the Company’s sales channels, develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading CAD, product data management (PDM) and PLM systems.

The Company has technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, Dassault Systemes, Parametric Technology Corporation,
Solid Edge, Solid Works and UGS Corporation, to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and ANSYS products.

The Company has established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware, including Hewlett-Packard, SGI, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Dell, Intel, Fujitsu
America and various graphics card vendors. These relationships typically provide the Company with joint marketing opportunities such as advertising, events and internet links with the hardware partner’s home page. In addition, the Company
receives reduced equipment costs and software porting support to ensure that the Company’s software products are certified to run on various hardware platforms.

The Company’s Enhanced Solution Partner Program actively encourages specialized developers of niche software solutions to use ANSYS technology as a development platform for their applications. In most cases, the
sale of the Enhanced Solution Partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ANSYS product. Mathsoft and RoboBAT have worked with ANSYS in the past year to seamlessly integrate their products with ANSYS Workbench. In both partnerships, the
solutions enable a myriad of new possibilities, such as streamlined calculation and simulation with Mathsoft, and expanded access to structural engineering applications with RoboBAT. The end result is increased productivity for customers.

The Company has a software license agreement with Livermore Software Technology Corporation (“LSTC”) under which LSTC has provided LS-DYNA
software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulation in the automotive and other industries. Under this arrangement, LSTC assists in the integration of the LS-DYNA software with the Company’s pre- and
post-processing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA combined product.

The Company has an agreement with Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk”) under which Autodesk licenses ANSYS part-level stress and resonant frequency simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of the Autodesk Inventor
Professional product.

The Company has an agreement with Le Centre Technique des Industries Mecaniques (“CETIM”) of Senlis, France, under which
CETIM licenses ANSYS Workbench and simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of their current DesignSpace PE products and future releases.


COMPETITION

The
Company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms,
range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Although the Company believes that it
currently performs effectively with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to perform effectively with respect to all or any of these factors. There also can be no assurance that other software
suppliers and customers will not develop their own software, or acquire software from suppliers other than the Company, or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the Company. If any of these events occur, the Company’s business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

The Company continues to experience intense competition
across all markets for its products and services. Some of the Company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established relationships with
current and potential customers of the Company. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES

The Company regards its software as
proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company
distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the Company’s products, which are typically nontransferable. License agreements for the Company’s products are directly
between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software. Software security measures are also employed to
prevent unauthorized use of the Company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software. Customers may either purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the
right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and updates, or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades.

For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on “click-wrapped” licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some
jurisdictions is uncertain.

The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The
Company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ANSYS, CFX, DesignSpace, and AUTODYN in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based
reporting technology and has a patent pending for its simulation wizard technology.

Employees of the Company have signed covenant agreements under which
they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information, and where legally permitted, which restrict engagement in or connection with any business which is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world, while employed by the
Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel partners and resellers
to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information.

Despite these precautions, there can be no
assurance that misappropriation of the Company’s technology will not occur. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for the Company’s products in certain countries,
or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the Company will be enforceable.

The
software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name
recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available.


The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be
no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software product developers will increasingly
be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors continue to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause
product shipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company.

SEASONAL VARIATIONS

The Company’s business has experienced
significant seasonality, including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown in Europe during the summer months, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the Company’s customers.

BACKLOG

The Company generally ships its products within 30 days
after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2005, the Company and its
subsidiaries had approximately 600 full-time employees. At that date, there were also contract personnel and co-op students providing ongoing development services and technical support. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees
is good.

. The Company makes available on its website Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, reports filed pursuant to Section 16 and amendments to those reports as soon
as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Company has posted the charters for its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, as well as the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Standard Business Practices. Information posted on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS

The Company cautions investors that its performance (and, therefore, any forward-looking statement) is subject to risks and uncertainties. Various important factors including, but not limited to, the following may cause the Company’s
future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.

Potential Fluctuations in Operating Results.

The
Company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results. Fluctuations may be caused by many factors, including the timing of new product releases or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors; the size and
timing of individual orders, including a fluctuation in the demand for and the ability to complete large contracts; software errors or other product quality problems; competition and pricing changes; customer order deferrals in anticipation of new
products or product enhancements; changes in demand for the Company’s products; changes in operating expenses; changes in the mix of software license and maintenance and service revenue; personnel changes; and general economic conditions. A
substantial portion of the Company’s operating expenses is related to personnel, facilities and marketing programs. The level of personnel and related expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based, in significant part, on the Company’s
expectation for future revenue. The Company does not typically experience significant order backlog. Further, the Company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter, with this revenue frequently
concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter. During certain quarterly periods, the Company has been dependent upon receiving large orders of perpetual licenses involving the payment of a single up-front fee and, more recently, has shifted
the business emphasis of its products to provide a collaborative solution to the Company’s customers. This emphasis has increased the Company’s average order size and increased the related sales cycle time for the larger orders. This shift
may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the Company’s revenue and profit from period to period. As a result, product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon sales completed in the latter part of that quarter, and
revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy.

Seasonal Variations.

The Company’s business
has experienced significant seasonality, including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown in Europe during the summer months, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the Company’s customers.

Economic Slowdown in Certain Sectors.

The Company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial
sectors. Many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines. These economic declines may be exacerbated by other economic factors, such as the recent increase in global energy prices. These economic factors may adversely affect the
Company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue.

The Company has customers who supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in
virtually all of the world’s major economic regions. The Company’s performance is materially impacted by general economic conditions and the performance of its customers. The Company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends
and developments and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. When forecasting future economic trends and technological developments, management
does not have a comparative advantage. To the extent that the Company’s forecasts are in error by being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or sector, the Company’s performance may be hindered
because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions.

Terrorist attacks, other increased global hostilities and natural
disasters have, at times, contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets. This uncertainty and speculation may result in further economic contraction, resulting in the suspension or delay of purchasing by the
Company’s customers.

Stock Market and Stock Price Volatility.

Market prices for securities of software companies have generally been
volatile. In particular, the market price of the Company’s common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the Company, the software industry or the securities markets in
general. Such factors include, but are not limited to, declines in trading price that may be triggered by the Company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The Company cannot provide assurance that in such
circumstances the trading price of the Company’s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline. Moreover, the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in
the Company’s operating results, material announcements made by the Company or its competitors, conditions in the software industry generally or other events and factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.


Rapidly Changing Technology; New Products; Risk of Product Defects.

The Company operates in an industry
generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. A major factor in the Company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate
technological changes and to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, enhancements to its existing products and new products to meet those changes. If the Company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes, its
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

The introduction and marketing of new or
enhanced products require the Company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in developing and marketing, on a
timely basis, new products or product enhancements, that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products. Software products as complex as those
offered by the Company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the Company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its
product releases. There can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of
development resources, damage to the Company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Sales of New Products.

The Company continues to develop and introduce new software products. Certain of these products require a higher
level of sales and support expertise. The ability of the Company’s sales channel, particularly the indirect channel, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an impact on the Company’s sales in
future periods. Additionally, royalties and engineering service engagements associated with the new software products may result in the Company’s cost of sales increasing as a percentage of revenue in future periods.

Dependence on Channel Partners.

The Company continues to distribute a substantial portion of its products through its global network of independent,
regional channel partners. The channel partners sell the Company’s software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical
support. Consequently, the Company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as delays in collecting accounts receivable, failure to meet performance criteria or
to promote the Company’s products as aggressively as the Company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the Company’s performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner for
any reason, including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the Company’s products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, the Company’s future success will depend substantially on
the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the Company’s products and to support a larger installed base of the Company’s products. If the channel partners are unable or
unwilling to do so, the Company may be unable to sustain revenue growth.

Currently the Company is partially protected from exchange rate fluctuations
among the U.S. Dollar and other currencies as a result of its indirect sales channel, which generally pays the Company in U.S. Dollars. The revenues and expenses associated with the Company’s international direct sales channel are subject
to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and, as a result, the Company’s future financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Additionally, any future changes to the Company’s sales channel involving proportionally
higher direct sales from international locations could result in additional exposure to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This exposure could adversely impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations in future
periods.

Competition.

The Company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services. Some of the
Company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. These
competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.


Dependence on Senior Management and Key Technical Personnel.

The Company is highly dependent upon the
ability and experience of its senior executives and its key technical and other management employees. Although the Company has employment agreements with certain employees, the loss of these employees, or any of the Company’s other key
employees, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct its operations.

Risks Associated with International Activities.

A
majority of the Company’s business comes from outside the United States of America. Risks inherent in the Company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls, export license requirements, restrictions on
the export of critical technology, products and services, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and taxes, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable payment cycles
and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations. Effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the Company sells its products and services. The
Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.

As the
Company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in
currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, countries
in certain international regions have continued to experience weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the Company’s products and ultimately the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

As the Company has grown, it has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse
changes in domestic and global economic conditions. As a result of the current economic slowdown, many companies are delaying or reducing technology purchases, which has had an impact on the Company’s visibility into the closing of new
business, as opposed to its recurring business. This slowdown has also contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, reductions in sales, longer sales cycles and increased price pressure. Each of these items could adversely affect the
Company’s sales in future periods.

The Company has historically received significant tax benefits related to its export activities. In October 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for existing export benefits. This bill retains certain export benefits for transactions in the ordinary course of business under binding contracts with
unrelated persons in effect on September 17, 2003. The phase-out of the existing export benefits associated with the legislation is summarized as follows:

Export Benefit Phase-out

In addition to repealing the export tax benefits, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provides significant tax
relief for domestic manufacturers. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, qualifying entities may deduct a certain percentage (as defined below) of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their
taxable income for a taxable year. The deduction, however, is limited to 50% of an employer’s W-2 wages for the tax year. Beginning in 2010, when the 9% deduction is fully phased in, corporations facing a marginal tax rate of 35% would be
subject to an effective tax rate of 31.85% on qualifying income.

Manufacturing Income Deduction Phase-in


In 2005, export benefits reduced the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 2.9%. The impact of the above
legislation on the Company’s effective tax rate in 2005 was not significant. The Company expects the above legislation to adversely impact the effective tax rate by 1.0% in 2006. Any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated
with the Company’s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the Company’s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods.

Dependence on Proprietary Technology.

The Company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology. Although the Company was awarded a
patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based reporting technology, the Company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology. Although the Company maintains a trade secrets
program, enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and distributors, and limits access to and distribution of its software, documentation and other proprietary information, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the
Company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties, or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Although the Company is not aware that
any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the Company or that, if asserted, such claims will not prevail.

Increased Reliance on Perpetual Licenses.

Although the Company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease
licenses, software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties, it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single up-front fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry. While revenue
generated from software lease licenses, software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the Company’s software license revenue, to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a
significant percentage of total software license revenue, the Company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period.

Risks Associated with Acquisitions.

The Company has consummated and may continue to consummate certain strategic acquisitions in order to provide increased capabilities to its existing products, supply new products and
services or enhance its distribution channels. In the future, the Company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or, if suitable candidates are identified, the Company may not be able to complete the business combination on
commercially acceptable terms. Business acquisitions may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources. The ability of the Company to integrate the acquired businesses, including delivering sales and support, ensuring
continued customer commitment, obtaining further commitments and challenges associated with expanding sales in particular markets and retaining key personnel, will impact the success of these acquisitions. If the Company is unable to properly and
timely integrate the acquired businesses, there could be a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Disruption of Operations or Infrastructure Failures.

A significant portion of the Company’s software development personnel, source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in
the United States, Canada and Europe. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the Company’s operations, services and product development activities.
Additionally, if the Company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure, such as a computer virus, telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party, these interruptions
could have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines. Further, because the Company’s sales are not generally linear
during any quarterly period, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the Company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter.

Periodic Reorganization of Sales Force.

The Company relies heavily on its direct sales force. From time to time, the Company reorganizes and makes
adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes, performance issues, market opportunities and other considerations. These changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in
future quarters. There can be no assurance that the Company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur.

Third Party Royalty Agreements.

The Company has agreements with third parties whereby it receives royalty revenues in return for the right of the third
party to utilize the Company’s technology or embed the Company’s technology in the third party’s products. To the extent that the Company is unable to maintain these third party relationships, or that the third party is unsuccessful
in selling the embedded products, there could be a material, adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


Sales Forecasts.

The Company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term
sales forecasts. The Company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals, including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale, in order to forecast quarterly sales. These forecasts are subject to significant
estimation and are impacted by many external factors. For example, a slowdown in information technology spending or economic factors could cause purchasing decisions to be delayed. A variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could
cause the Company to plan or to budget incorrectly and, therefore, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Income Tax Estimates.

The Company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision. These estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the
Company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax matters could be different
than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made.

Regulatory Compliance.

Like all other public companies, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), including those that require the Company to report on and receive a certification from its independent accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal controls. Compliance with these requirements causes the Company to incur
additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the day-to-day operations of the Company. While the Company anticipates being able to fully comply with these internal control requirements, if it is not able to comply with the
Sarbanes-Oxley reporting or certification requirements relating to internal controls, the Company may be subject to sanction by the SEC or NASDAQ.

The
Company’s stock is listed on The NASDAQ National Market; thus, the Company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ. While the Company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements, if
it is not able to comply, the Company’s name may be published on NASDAQ’s daily Non-Compliant Companies list until NASDAQ determines that it has regained compliance or the Company no longer trades on NASDAQ.

The Company’s sales to the Government of the United States must comply with the regulations set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Failure to comply with
these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the Company or an order preventing the Company from making future sales to the United States Government. Further, the Company’s international activities must comply with the
export control laws of the United States, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the United States of America and other countries in which the Company operates. Failure to comply with any of these laws and
regulations could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, results of operation and cash flows.

Contingencies.

The
Company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. These proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various taxing authorities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Changes in Existing Financial Accounting Standards or Taxation Rules.

Changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current
accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or the manner in which the Company conducts its business. Further, such changes could potentially affect the
Company’s reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. For example, the Company is not currently required to record stock-based compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock option grants to its employees.
However, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R) which will require the Company to record stock-based compensation charges to earnings commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Such charges will negatively impact the Company’s earnings.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is exposed to certain market risks, primarily foreign currency
exchange rates, that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business. The Company seeks to minimize these risks primarily through its normal operating and financing activities.

ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


ITEM 2: PROPERTIES

The Company’s executive offices and those related to domestic product development, marketing, production and administration are located in a 107,000 square foot office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, leased in January 1996. In
May 2004, the Company entered into the first amendment to this lease agreement, effective January 1, 2004. The lease was extended from an original period of ten years, with an option for five additional years, to a period of 18 years from the
inception date, with an option for five additional years. The Company and its subsidiaries also lease office space in various locations throughout the world. The Company owns substantially all equipment used in its facilities. Management believes
that its facilities allow for sufficient space to support not only its present needs, but also allow for expansion and growth as the business may require in the foreseeable future.

In the opinion of management, the Company’s properties and its equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for the Company’s current needs. The Company does not anticipate difficulty in
renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities.

ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings currently include customary audit
activities by various taxing authorities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. Management believes, after consulting with legal counsel, that the
ultimate liabilities, if any, resulting from such legal proceedings will not materially affect the Company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to pages 13 through 31 of the Company’s 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders,
including the “Important Factors Regarding Future Results.”

ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk.

Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the Company’s
investments. For the year ended December 31, 2005, total interest income was $4.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as time deposits held at major banks, money market mutual funds and other
securities with remaining maturities of three months or less. The Company considers investments backed by government agencies or U.S. financial institutions to be highly liquid and, accordingly, classifies such investments as short-term investments.

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.

As the Company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its
revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the Company’s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. On average, for the year ended December 31, 2005, the U.S. Dollar was 0.5% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
U.S. Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, the Japanese Yen and the Euro while it weakened against the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar. As a result of these fluctuations, the net adverse impact on revenue and operating income
during 2005, as compared with 2004, was $300,000 and $600,000, respectively.

Based on the nature of the Company’s
business, it has no direct exposure to commodity price risk.

ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to pages 32 through 54 of the Company’s 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is attached
hereto as Exhibit 13.1.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the certifying officers by others within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries during the period covered by this report.

The Company has a Disclosure Review Committee to assist in the quarterly evaluation of the Company’s internal disclosure controls and procedures and in the review of the Company’s periodic filings under the
Exchange Act. The membership of the Disclosure Review Committee consists of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, General Counsel, Treasurer, Vice President of Sales and Suppport, Vice President of Human
Resources and Business Unit General Managers. This committee is advised by external counsel, particularly on SEC-related matters. Additionally, other members of the Company’s global management team advise the committee with respect to
disclosure via a sub-certification process.


The Company believes, based on its knowledge, that the financial statements and other financial information included in
this report fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. The Company cannot provide assurance that new problems will not be
found in the future, nor does it expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or its internal controls, will prevent all errors and all fraud because no system can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within ANSYS have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some person or by collusion of two or more people. The Company is
committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance.

From time to time, the Company reviews the disclosure controls
and procedures, and may make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business.

As of
the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ANSYS’ disclosure controls and procedures by the Company. Based on that evaluation, the Company has concluded that its
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

The Company’s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective at December 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Deloitte & Touche LLP has issued an attestation report on the Company’s controls
over financial reporting. The report is included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no
changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2005.
