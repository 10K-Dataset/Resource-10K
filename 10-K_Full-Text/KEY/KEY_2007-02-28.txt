ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
    is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It has elected to be a bank
    holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank
    Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). At
    December 31, 2006, KeyCorp was one of the nation’s
    largest bank-based financial services companies with
    consolidated total assets of $92.3 billion. Its
    subsidiaries provide a wide range of retail and commercial
    banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer
    finance and investment banking products and services to
    individual, corporate and institutional clients through two
    major business groups: Community Banking and National Banking.
    As of December 31, 2006, these services were provided
    across much of the country through subsidiaries operating 950
    full-service retail banking branches (“KeyCenters”), a
    telephone banking call center services group and 2,050 ATMs, in
    sixteen states. Additional information pertaining to the two
    business groups is included in the “Line of Business
    Results” section beginning on page 25 and in
    Note 4 (“Line of Business Results”) beginning on
    page 76 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2006 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto) and
    is incorporated herein by reference. KeyCorp and its
    subsidiaries had an average of 20,006 full-time equivalent
    employees during 2006.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
    deposits and making loans, KeyCorp’s bank and trust company
    subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
    personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
    management services, investment banking and capital markets
    products, and international banking services. Through its
    subsidiary bank, trust company and registered investment adviser
    subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides investment management services to
    clients that include large corporate and public retirement
    plans, foundations and endowments, high net worth individuals
    and Taft-Hartley plans (i.e., multiemployer trust funds
    established for providing pension, vacation or other benefits to
    employees).

KeyCorp provides other financial services both inside and
    outside of its primary banking markets through its nonbank
    subsidiaries. These services include accident, health, and
    credit-life insurance on loans made by its subsidiary bank,
    principal investing, community development financing, securities
    underwriting and brokerage, merchant services, and other
    financial services. KeyCorp is an equity participant in a joint
    venture by Key Merchant Services, LLC, which provides merchant
    services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank
    and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
    security holders and its creditors to participate in any
    distribution of the assets or earnings of KeyCorp’s bank
    and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the
    respective creditors of such bank and other subsidiaries, except
    to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as
    creditor of such bank and other subsidiaries may be recognized.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 3 (“Acquisitions and
    Divestitures”) on page 75 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto) is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
    competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
    compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
    holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
    credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
    mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms,
    investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local,
    regional and national institutions which offer financial
    services.  Key competes by offering quality products and
    innovative services at competitive prices.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
    concentration in the banking industry and placed added
    competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and
    services. In addition, competition has intensified as a
    consequence of the financial modernization laws that were
    enacted in November 1999 to permit qualifying financial
    institutions to expand into other activities. For example,
    commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that
    underwrite and deal in securities, underwrite insurance and make
    merchant banking investments under certain conditions.  See
    “Financial Modernization Legislation” on page 8
    of this report.

Supervision
    and Regulation

The following discussion addresses certain material elements of
    the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies
    and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information
    regarding Key.  The regulatory framework is intended primarily
    to protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund
    (“DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    (“FDIC”) and the banking system as a whole, and
    generally is not intended to protect security holders.

Set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws,
    regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to Key.
    This discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is
    qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
    statutes, regulations and regulatory agency policies to which
    the discussion refers.  Changes in applicable laws,



regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be
    predicted by management, yet such changes may have a material
    effect on Key’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”)
    under the BHCA.  Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
    in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
    all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies
    are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or
    industrial activities.  KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries are
    also subject to extensive regulation, supervision and
    examination by applicable federal banking agencies. KeyCorp
    operates one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank
    subsidiary, KeyBank National Association (“KBNA”), and
    one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to
    those of a fiduciary. Both of KeyCorp’s national bank
    subsidiaries, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of
    the Currency (the “OCC”). Because the domestic
    deposits in KBNA are insured (up to applicable limits) by the
    FDIC, the FDIC also has certain regulatory and supervisory
    authority over KBNA.

KeyCorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are
    subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve Board, as well as other applicable state and
    federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
    For example, KeyCorp’s brokerage and asset management
    subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the
    National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the New York
    Stock Exchange

and/or

state
    securities regulators, and KeyCorp’s insurance subsidiaries
    are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
    authorities of the various states. Other nonbank subsidiaries of
    KeyCorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they are authorized
    to do business.

Dividend
    Restrictions

The principal source of cash flow to KeyCorp, including cash
    flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its
    indebtedness, is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various
    statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of
    dividends that may be paid by KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries
    without regulatory approval.  The approval of the OCC is
    required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if
    the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of
    such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of:
    (i) the bank’s net income for the current year plus
    (ii) the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by
    regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
    transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any
    preferred stock.  In addition, a national bank can pay dividends
    only to the extent of its undivided profits. KeyCorp’s
    national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
    institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
    engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
    financial condition of the institution, could include the
    payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
    institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
    FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
    depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
    level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), an
    insured depository institution may not pay any dividend
    (i) if payment would cause it to become less than
    “adequately capitalized,” or (ii) while it is in
    default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. See
    “Regulatory Capital Standards and Related
    Matters — Prompt Corrective Action” on
    page 6 of this report. Also, the federal banking agencies
    have issued policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured
    depository institutions and their holding companies should
    generally pay dividends only out of their current operating
    earnings.

Holding
    Company Structure

Bank Transactions With Affiliates.

Federal
    banking law and regulation impose qualitative standards and
    quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank
    with its affiliates. Transactions covered by these provisions,
    which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to
    affiliates, bank purchases of assets from affiliates, and



bank sales of assets to affiliates, must be on arm’s length
    terms, cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with
    reference to the bank’s regulatory capital, and if a loan
    or other extension of credit, must be secured by collateral in
    an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute. For these
    purposes, a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other
    companies it is deemed to control, while an affiliate includes
    the bank’s parent bank holding company, certain of its
    nonbank subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to
    control, and certain other companies. As a result, these
    provisions materially restrict the ability of KBNA, as a bank,
    to fund its affiliates including KeyCorp, McDonald Investments
    Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds, and KeyCorp’s
    nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking
    investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under Federal
    Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to
    serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each
    of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to
    commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This
    support may be required at a time when KeyCorp may not have the
    resources to provide it or would choose not to provide it.
    Certain loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are
    subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain
    other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal
    law provides that in the event of its bankruptcy, any commitment
    by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to
    maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
    bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The FDIA provides that,
    in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution”
    of an insured depository institution, the claims of its
    depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured
    depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of
    the FDIC as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other
    general unsecured claims against such an institution, including
    federal funds and letters of credit. If an insured depository
    institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with
    the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit
    creditors, including a parent holding company, in order of
    priority of payment.

Liability of Commonly Controlled
    Institutions.

Under the FDIA, an insured
    depository institution which is under common control with
    another insured depository institution is generally liable for
    any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by
    the FDIC in connection with the default of the commonly
    controlled institution, or any assistance provided by the FDIC
    to the commonly controlled institution which is in danger of
    default. The term “default” is defined generally to
    mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term
    “in danger of default” is defined generally as the
    existence of certain conditions indicating that a
    “default” is likely to occur in the absence of
    regulatory assistance.

Commercial Real Estate Lending
    Concentrations.

In December 2006, the banking
    agencies jointly issued final guidance on sound risk management
    practices for institutions having concentrations in commercial
    real estate (“CRE”) loans. Institutions actively
    involved in CRE lending should perform ongoing risk assessments
    to identify CRE concentrations. Institutions having such
    concentrations should have risk management practices that are
    commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration
    risk.  Key elements in establishing a risk management framework
    that effectively identifies, monitors, and controls CRE
    concentration risk include board and management oversight,
    portfolio management, management information systems, market
    analysis, credit underwriting standards, portfolio stress
    testing and sensitivity analysis, and credit risk review.
    Institutions having such concentrations also should have
    regulatory capital that is commensurate with the level and
    nature of their concentration risk. In assessing capital
    adequacy, the agencies will consider the level and nature of
    inherent risk in the CRE portfolio as well as management
    expertise, historical performance, underwriting standards, risk
    management practices, market conditions, and any loan loss
    reserves allocated for CRE concentration risk. Institutions
    potentially exposed to significant CRE concentration risk may be
    identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and
    nature of CRE concentration risk.  Such institutions include
    those that have experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, have
    notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, or are approaching
    or have exceeded specific quantitative supervisory criteria.

Elevated Risk Complex Structured Finance
    Transactions.

In January 2007, the banking
    agencies and the SEC published an interagency statement on sound
    practices concerning elevated risk complex structured finance
    transactions (“CSFTs”) to describe the types of risk
    management principles they believe may help a financial
    institution identify CSFTs that may pose heightened levels of
    legal or reputational risk to the institution as well as
    evaluate, manage and address such risks within the
    institution’s internal control framework. The statement
    focuses



on the maintenance of policies and procedures designed to allow
    the institution to identify, evaluate, assess, document, and
    control the full range of market, credit, operational, legal,
    and reputational risks associated with elevated risk CSFTs. The
    statement also provides illustrative examples of both structured
    finance transactions that are not considered to be elevated risk
    CSFTs as well structured finance transactions that may be
    elevated risk CSFTs.

Regulatory
    Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory
    Capital.

Federal law and regulation define and
    prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding
    companies and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy of regulatory
    capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies
    in the examination and supervision process, and in the
    evaluation of applications in connection with specific
    transactions and activities, including acquisitions, expansion
    of existing activities, and commencement of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These
    guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to
    risk-weighted assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are
    calculated by assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories
    of assets and off-balance-sheet exposures, based primarily on
    counterparty credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1
    capital by risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The
    required minimum total risk-based capital ratio is currently
    8.00%. It is calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount
    of Tier 1 capital), after deducting for investments in
    certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal
    holdings of capital instruments, by risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
    preferred equity, and minority interests in the equity accounts
    of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets
    (including goodwill) and certain other assets. Tier 2
    capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments,
    perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, perpetual
    preferred equity not includable in Tier 1 capital, and
    limited amounts of term subordinated debt, medium-term preferred
    equity, certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity
    securities, and the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Bank holding companies, such as KeyCorp, whose securities and
    commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are
    required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk
    includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign
    exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad
    market movements (such as changes in the general level of
    interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or
    commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as
    idiosyncratic variation, event risk, and default risk). The
    banking agencies have developed and published for comment a
    proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital
    requirements. The proposed rule would enhance modeling
    requirements consistent with advances in risk management,
    enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the
    current methodologies of the existing requirements, and modify
    the definition of covered position to better capture positions
    for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate.
    It would also impose an explicit capital requirement for
    incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time
    horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity,
    concentrations, hedging, and optionality. In general, the
    proposed rule would become effective in January 2008. At
    December 31, 2006, Key’s Tier 1 and total capital
    to risk-weighted assets ratios were 8.24% and 12.43%,
    respectively, which include required adjustments for market risk.

In addition to the risk-based standard, bank holding companies
    are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s leverage ratio
    guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage ratio,
    calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average total
    consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding companies that
    either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented
    the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for
    market risk. All other bank holding companies must maintain a
    minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. Neither KeyCorp nor
    any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary
    federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio
    applicable to it. At December 31, 2006, Key’s
    Tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 8.98%.



KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC,
    which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal
    Reserve Board on bank holding companies. At December 31,
    2006, each of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries had
    regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based and
    leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
    to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
    that are not taken into account in the computation of the
    capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
    evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
    adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
    regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
    organization. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has
    advised KeyCorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any
    specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratio applicable
    to KeyCorp or such national bank subsidiary. Additional
    information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in
    the “Capital” section beginning on page 43 of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Recourse Obligations, Direct Credit Substitutes, and Residual
    Interests.

Specialized regulatory capital
    treatment is prescribed for on-balance sheet assets and
    off-balance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations,
    direct credit substitutes, and residual interests that expose
    banking organizations primarily to credit risk. This treatment
    includes a concentration limit Tier 1 capital charge and a

dollar-for-dollar

capital charge for certain types of residual interests and the
    use of credit rating and certain alternative approaches to match
    regulatory capital requirements more closely to a banking
    organization’s relative risk of loss for certain positions
    in asset securitizations.

Equity Investments in Nonfinancial
    Companies.

Specialized regulatory capital
    treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by
    banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial
    activities. This treatment imposes marginal capital charges
    (applied by making deductions from Tier 1 capital) that
    increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying
    amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to
    its Tier 1 capital. Such capital charges range from 8% to
    25% as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15% to 25%
    of the banking organization’s Tier 1 capital.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The “prompt
    corrective action” provisions of the FDIA create a
    statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary
    and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level
    of FDIC-insured depository institutions. These provisions impose
    progressively more restrictive constraints on operations,
    management, and capital distributions of an institution as its
    regulatory capital decreases, or in some cases, based on
    supervisory information other than the institution’s
    capital level. This framework and the authority it confers on
    the federal banking agencies supplements other existing
    authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory
    actions to address capital deficiencies. Moreover, other
    provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level
    designations the same as or similar to those established by the
    prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain
    restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic
    and other benefits upon institutions. These include restrictions
    on brokered deposits, FDIC deposit insurance limits on
    pass-through deposits, limits on exposure to interbank
    liabilities, risk-based FDIC deposit insurance premium
    assessments, and expedited action upon regulatory applications.

FDIC-insured depository institutions are grouped into one of
    five prompt corrective action capital categories —
    well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
    significantly undercapitalized and critically
    undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based,
    total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the
    relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well
    capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
    least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
    6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
    and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
    directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution must have
    a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.00% and a
    Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.00% (3.00% if
    it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent
    examination). At December 31, 2006, KBNA, KeyCorp’s
    only FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiary, met the
    requirements for the “well capitalized” capital
    category. An institution’s prompt corrective action capital
    category, however, may not constitute an accurate representation
    of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or
    its bank subsidiaries, and should be considered in conjunction
    with other available information regarding Key’s financial
    condition and results of operations.



Basel Accords.

The current minimum risk-based
    capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking
    agencies are based on a 1988 international accord (“Basel
    I”) that was developed by the international Basel Committee
    on Banking Supervision.  In 2004, the Basel Committee published
    its new capital framework document (“Basel II”)
    governing the capital adequacy of large, internationally active
    banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
    management and measurement systems.  Basel II is designed
    to create incentives for these organizations to improve their
    risk measurement and management processes and to better align
    minimum capital requirements with the risks underlying
    activities conducted by these organizations.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
    capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
    supervisory review, and market discipline. The minimum capital
    requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit,
    operational, and market risk exposures of a banking
    organization. The supervisory review pillar addresses the need
    for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy
    position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with
    respect to its minimum capital requirement, as well as the need
    for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and
    respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy
    assessment. The market discipline pillar imposes public
    disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are
    intended to allow market participants to assess key information
    about the organization’s risk profile and its associated
    level of capital.

The agencies have developed and published for comment a proposed
    rule for implementing Basel II in the U.S.  The
    proposed rule would apply to certain organizations on a
    mandatory basis, as well as to those that elect voluntarily to
    do so.  Organizations that are required or have elected to apply
    the proposed rule are subject to a transitional implementation
    timeline of at least 4 years.  During the transition
    period, limits are imposed upon the amount by which minimum
    required capital may decrease.  January 2008 is the earliest
    start date for the transition period.  The proposed rule would
    apply to determine the risk-based capital requirement for
    wholesale, retail, equity, and securitization exposures, and
    imposes an explicit capital charge for operational risk.  The
    Basel II proposed rule does not effect any change in the
    existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital
    requirements, and explicitly reserves the agencies’
    authority to require organizations to hold additional capital
    where appropriate.

The agencies also have developed and published for comment a
    proposed rule to update their existing Basel I risk-based
    capital standards (“Basel IA”) in order to enhance the
    risk-sensitivity of the capital charges, to reflect changes in
    accounting standards and financial markets, and to address
    competitive equity questions that may be raised by
    U.S. implementation of Basel II. The Basel IA proposed rule
    would be available to organizations not covered by the
    Basel II proposed rule. It would be optional in that such
    an organization could elect to adopt the Basel IA proposed rule
    in its entirety or remain under the existing Basel I risk-based
    capital rules. The Basel IA proposed rule would increase the
    number of risk-weight categories, allow greater use of external
    credit ratings, expand the range of recognized collateral and
    eligible guarantors, use

loan-to-value

ratios to risk-weight residential mortgages, increase the credit
    conversion factor for certain short-term commitments, assess a
    capital charge for early amortizations in securitizations of
    revolving retail exposures, and remove the 50% limit on the
    risk-weight for certain derivative transactions. The Basel IA
    proposed rule does not effect any change in the existing prompt
    corrective action and leverage capital requirements, and
    explicitly reserves the agencies’ authority to require
    organizations to compute the risk-based capital requirement
    under the existing Basel I risk-based capital rules.

FDIC Deposit Insurance

Because substantially all of KBNA’s domestic deposits are
    insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, KBNA is subject to
    deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. Comprehensive
    deposit insurance reform legislation was enacted in 2006.
    Pursuant to this legislation, the former Bank Insurance Fund and
    Savings Association Insurance Fund were merged into the DIF,
    deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts has increased
    from $100,000 to $250,000, and deposit insurance limits for
    accounts are subject to an indexing mechanism for future
    increases in coverage limits. The legislation also requires the
    FDIC to maintain the DIF reserve ratio within a range of
    1.15%-1.50% of estimated insured deposits, with a DIF
    restoration plan being required upon the FDIC’s
    determination that the DIF reserve ratio has fallen or will
    within six months fall below 1.15% of estimated insured
    deposits. Other changes made by this legislation have permitted
    the FDIC to change its previous risk-related deposit insurance
    assessment framework. Under the new assessment framework,
    premiums ranging tentatively from $.05 to $.43 in 2007 (compared
    with zero to $.27 throughout 2006) for each $100 of
    domestic deposits will be assessed based upon an
    institution’s capitalization, financial ratios (or, for
    certain large



institutions, long-term debt issuer ratings), and federal
    supervisory evaluation. This new legislation and the FDIC’s
    new assessment framework implementing it also authorizes certain
    premium assessment credits (including a one-time assessment
    credit for KBNA of approximately $59.4 million) and, under
    certain circumstances, requires certain dividends from the DIF.

Financial
    Modernization Legislation

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”)
    authorized new activities for qualifying financial
    institutions.  The GLBA repealed significant provisions of the

Glass-Steagall

Act to permit commercial banks to, among other things, have
    affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make
    merchant banking investments.  The GLBA modified the BHCA to
    permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified
    standards (known as “financial holding companies”) to
    engage in a broader range of financial activities than
    previously permitted under the BHCA, and allowed subsidiaries of
    commercial banks that meet certain specified standards (known as
    “financial subsidiaries”) to engage in a wide range of
    financial activities that are prohibited to such banks
    themselves.  In 2000, KeyCorp elected to become a financial
    holding company. Under the authority conferred by the GLBA, Key
    has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity
    investments in nonfinancial companies, operate its McDonald
    Investments Inc. subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions,
    and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate
    leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic
    restriction.

The GLBA also established new privacy protections for customers
    of financial institutions.  Under federal law, a financial
    institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy
    policies and practices, describe the conditions under which the
    financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal
    information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties, and
    provide an “opt-out” method for consumers to prevent
    the financial institution from disclosing that information to
    non-affiliated third parties.

The GLBA repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings
    associations from the definitions of “broker” and
    “dealer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    (the “Exchange Act”), and replaced this full exception
    with functional exceptions. Under the statute, institutions that
    engage in securities activities either must conduct those
    activities through a registered broker-dealer or conform their
    securities activities to those which qualify for functional
    exceptions. While the requirements relating to dealer
    registration have become effective, the effective date of the
    requirements relating to broker registration has been delayed
    until July 2007.

USA
    PATRIOT Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) and the federal regulations
    issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing
    anti-money laundering law and regulation, increase compliance,
    due diligence and reporting obligations for financial
    institutions, create new crimes and penalties, and require the
    federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other
    acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the
    parties in combating money laundering activities.

In October 2005, KBNA consented to the issuance of a consent
    order (“Order”) from the OCC pursuant to which KBNA is
    required to improve its compliance and operations infrastructure
    designed, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), to
    detect and prevent money laundering.  As part of the Order, KBNA
    has agreed to strengthen its BSA internal controls, including
    the development and implementation of enhanced policies and
    procedures for BSA compliance; to enhance its programs and
    controls for Suspicious Activity Reporting; to enhance its BSA
    audit functions and its independent audit program; and to
    improve employee training relating to the detection and
    prevention of money laundering. At the same time, KeyCorp
    entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
    with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (“FRB”)
    covering compliance with the BSA and other related matters.
    Neither the OCC nor the FRB imposed a fine or civil money
    penalty in connection with these actions.

KeyCorp and KBNA have taken significant steps to strengthen the
    organizations’ compliance policies and procedures, and
    operations infrastructure in areas related to those specified in
    the Order and the MOU, as well as in other respects.  Management
    is committed to ensuring that all of the requirements of these
    regulatory actions are met.



Fair and
    Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003
    (“FACT Act”) imposes new requirements on financial
    institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit
    bureaus. The FACT Act also allows customers to choose to opt out
    of having certain information shared across a financial
    institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes.
    Compliance with the FACT Act requires Key to modify numerous
    computer systems and to make operational changes in several
    business areas. Key believes that the changes that it has
    already made or will implement in 2007 will satisfy the material
    requirements of the FACT Act and the current regulations
    implementing it. Although additional FACT Act implementing
    regulations are still pending that may mandate additional
    disclosures or impose system or process changes, Key believes
    that it will be able to implement any new regulatory
    requirements within the time frames provided.

Entry
    Into Certain Covenants

In 2006, KeyCorp entered into two transactions involving the
    issuance of trust preferred securities
    (“Trust Preferred Securities”) by Delaware
    statutory trusts formed by KeyCorp (the “Trusts”), as
    further described below. Simultaneously with the closing of each
    of those transactions, KeyCorp entered into a replacement
    capital covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital
    Covenant” and collectively, the “Replacement Capital
    Covenants”) for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or
    sell a specified series of long-term indebtedness of KeyCorp or
    its then largest depository institution, currently KBNA (the
    “Covered Debt”). Each of the Replacement Capital
    Covenants provide that neither KeyCorp nor any of its
    subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts) will redeem or
    purchase all or any part of the Trust Preferred Securities
    or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by KeyCorp and
    held by the Trust (the “Junior Subordinated
    Debentures”), as applicable, on or before the date
    specified in the applicable Replacement Capital Covenant, with
    certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that, during
    the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or
    purchase, KeyCorp has received proceeds from the sale of
    qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the Trust Preferred
    Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, as applicable,
    at the time of redemption or purchase, and (ii) KeyCorp has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if
    such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.
    KeyCorp will provide a copy of the Replacement Capital Covenants
    to respective holders of Covered Debt upon request made in
    writing to KeyCorp, Investor Relations, at 127 Public
    Square (Mail Code OH-01-27-1113), Cleveland, OH 44114-1306.

The following table identifies the (i) closing date for
    each transaction, (ii) issuer, (iii) series of
    Trust Preferred Securities issued, (iv) Junior
    Subordinated Debentures, and (v) applicable Covered Debt as

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

An investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent
    to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that
    management believes affect us are described below. Before making
    an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks
    and uncertainties described below together with all of the other
    information included or



incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and
    uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
    Although we have significant risk management policies,
    procedures and verification processes in place, additional risks
    and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on
    or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair
    our business operations. This report is qualified in its
    entirety by these risk factors.

If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our
    common shares could decline, perhaps significantly, and you
    could lose all or part of your investment.

Risks
    Related To Our Business

We Are
    Subject To Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
    interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
    interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
    and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
    are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
    control, including general economic conditions, the competitive
    environment within our markets, consumer preferences for
    specific loan and deposit products and policies of various
    governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the
    Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including
    changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount
    of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
    interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
    could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
    deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
    liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
    borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
    receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
    and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
    could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
    loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest
    we pay on deposits and other borrowings.

Although management believes it has implemented effective asset
    and liability management strategies, including the use of
    derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential
    effects of changes in interest rates on our results of
    operations, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations. Additional information regarding interest rate risk
    is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Market risk
    management — Interest rate risk management”
    beginning on page 47 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Other Market Risk In Addition To Interest Rate
    Risk

The values of some financial instruments vary not only with
    changes in market interest rates, but also with changes in
    foreign exchange rates, factors influencing valuations in the
    equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or
    prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline
    if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the
    U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other
    currencies. When the value of an instrument is tied to such
    external factors, the holder faces “market risk.”

Although management believes it has implemented effective
    strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit
    spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolio, any
    substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in those factors could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
    Additional information regarding market risk is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Market risk
    management — Trading portfolio risk management”
    beginning on page 49 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Credit Risk

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
    activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
    of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
    conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
    interest rates

and/or

weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability
    of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the
    collateral securing these loans. We also are subject to various
    laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Failure
    to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us
    to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the
    assessment against us of civil money or other penalties.



As of December 31, 2006, approximately 73.4% of our loan
    portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
    loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
    mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
    types of loans (and leases) are generally viewed as potentially
    having more risk of default than residential real estate loans
    or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically
    larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans.
    Although we closely monitor and manage risk concentrations and
    utilize various portfolio management practices to limit
    excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so, our loan
    portfolio still does contain a number of commercial loans with
    relatively large balances. The deterioration of one or a few of
    these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing
    loans, and an increase in non-performing loans could result in a
    net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the
    provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan
    charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition and results of operations. Additional
    information regarding credit risk is included in the section
    captioned “Risk Management — Credit risk
    management” beginning on page 49 of the Financial
    Review section of KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Various
    Factors May Cause Our Allowance For Possible Loan Losses To
    Increase

We maintain an allowance for possible loan losses, which is a
    reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses
    charged to expense, that represents management’s estimate
    of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The
    allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to
    reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan
    portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s
    continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific
    credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio
    quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions;
    and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.
    The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for
    possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of
    subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of
    current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo
    material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting
    borrowers, new information regarding existing loans,
    identification of additional problem loans and other factors,
    both within and outside of our control, may require an increase
    in the allowance for possible loan losses. In addition, bank
    regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically
    review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase
    in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of
    further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ
    somewhat from those of our own management. In addition, if
    charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible
    loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the
    allowance for possible loan losses. Additional provisions to
    increase the allowance for possible loan losses, should they
    become necessary, would result in a decrease in net income and
    capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations. Additional information
    regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Credit risk
    management — Allowance for loan losses” beginning
    on page 50 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Liquidity Risk

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
    level or cost of liquidity, affecting our ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences.  Although management has
    implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse
    sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as
    unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both
    normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.  Additional information regarding liquidity risk
    is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Liquidity risk management” beginning
    on page 54 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Operational Risk

We, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, which
    represents the risk of loss resulting from human error,
    inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
    external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
    (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or
    noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices or ethical standards. Although we seek to mitigate
    operational risk through a system of internal controls,
    resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of
    explicit charges, increased operational costs,



harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities, any and all of
    which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.  Additional information
    regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned
    “Risk Management — Operational risk
    management” beginning on page 57 of the Financial
    Review section of KeyCorp’s 2006 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Our
    Profitability Depends Significantly On Economic Conditions In
    The Geographic Regions In Which We Operate

Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions
    of the markets in which we operate. Although we are somewhat
    geographically diversified, assisted in part in this respect by
    our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and
    equipment leasing lines of business, we still do have
    concentrations of loans and other business activities in
    geographic areas where our KeyCenters are principally
    located — the Midwest, the Northeast and the Pacific
    Northwest.  The regional economic conditions in these areas have
    an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as
    the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the
    collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit
    funding sources.  A significant decline in general economic
    conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism,
    outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic
    occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or
    other factors could also impact these regional economies and, in
    turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

We
    Operate In A Highly Competitive Industry And Market
    Areas

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
    from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
    larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors
    primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
    smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
    operate. However, we also face competition from many other types
    of financial institutions, including, without limitation,
    savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies,
    finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
    management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
    other local, regional and national financial services firms. The
    financial services industry could become even more competitive
    as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes
    and continued consolidation.  Also, technology has lowered
    barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer
    products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
    factors, including, among other things:

•

Our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and
    initiatives.

•

Our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term
    customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical
    standards and safe, sound assets.

•

Our ability to expand our market position.

•

The scope, relevance and pricing of products and services
    offered to meet customer needs and demands.

•

The rate at which we introduce new products and services
    relative to our competitors.

•

Industry and general economic trends.

Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
    weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
    our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We Are
    Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And
    Supervision

We, primarily through KBNA and certain of its non-bank
    subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state
    regulation and supervision.  Banking regulations are primarily
    intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit
    insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not
    shareholders.  These regulations affect our lending practices,
    capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and
    growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory
    agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and
    policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations
    or regulatory policies; changes in the interpretation or
    implementation of statutes, regulations or policies;

and/or

continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
    requirements or



expectations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable
    ways.  Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit
    the types of financial services and products that we may offer

and/or

increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial
    services and products, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with laws, regulations or policies
    (including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent
    such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
    agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.
    Additional information regarding supervision and regulation is
    included in the section captioned “Supervision and
    Regulation” in Item 1. Business, beginning on
    page 2 of this report.

Our
    Controls And Procedures May Fail Or Be
    Circumvented

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls,
    disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance
    policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions
    and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that
    the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or
    circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to
    comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

We
    Rely On Dividends From Our Subsidiaries For Most Of Our
    Revenue

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from
    dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the
    principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares
    and interest and principal on our debt. Various laws and
    regulations limit the amount of dividends that KBNA and certain
    non-bank subsidiaries may pay to KeyCorp. Also, KeyCorp’s
    right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a
    subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to
    the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the
    event KBNA is unable to pay dividends to KeyCorp, we may not be
    able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our
    common shares. The inability to receive dividends from KBNA
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. Additional information
    regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section
    captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1.
    Business, beginning on page 2 of this report.

Potential
    Acquisitions May Disrupt Our Business And Dilute Shareholder
    Value

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
    risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
    other things:

•

Potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the
    target company.

•

Exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company.

•

Difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and
    personnel of the target company.

•

Potential disruption to our business.

•

Potential diversion of our management’s time and attention.

•

The possible loss of key employees and customers of the target
    company.

•

Difficulty in estimating the value (including goodwill) of the
    target company.

•

Difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets,
    liabilities and derivatives of the target company.

•

Potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may
    affect the target company.

We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
    conduct due diligence activities related to possible
    transactions with other financial institutions and financial
    services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
    discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
    future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
    securities may occur at any time.  Acquisitions typically
    involve the payment of a premium over book and market values,
    and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
    income per common share may



occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore,
    failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings,
    increases in geographic or product presence,

and/or

other
    projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

We May
    Not Be Able To Attract And Retain Skilled People

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
    and retain key people.  Competition for the best people in most
    activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not
    be able to hire or retain the people we want

and/or

need.
    Although we maintain employment agreements with certain key
    employees, and have incentive compensation plans aimed, in part,
    at long-term employee retention, the unexpected loss of services
    of one or more of our key personnel could still occur, and such
    events may have a material adverse impact on our business
    because of the loss of the employee’s skills, knowledge of
    our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of
    promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.

Our
    Information Systems May Experience An Interruption Or Breach In
    Security

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
    conduct our business.  Any failure, interruption or breach in
    security of these systems could result in failures or
    disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
    ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.  While we have policies
    and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
    possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
    information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
    failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or,
    if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The
    occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches
    of our information systems could damage our reputation, result
    in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional
    regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and
    possible financial liability, any of which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

We
    Continually Encounter Technological Change

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
    technological change with frequent introductions of new
    technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
    technology increases efficiency and enables financial
    institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs.  Our
    future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
    needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
    and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
    create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
    competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
    technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
    implement new technology-driven products and services or be
    successful in marketing these products and services to our
    customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological
    change affecting the financial services industry could have a
    material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We Are
    Subject To Claims And Litigation

From time to time, customers

and/or

vendors may make claims and take legal action against us.
    Whether these claims and legal action are founded or unfounded,
    if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor
    they may result in significant financial liability

and/or

adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products
    and services as well as impact customer demand for those
    products and services. Any financial liability or reputation
    damage could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    Earnings May Be Affected By Changes In Accounting Principles And
    In Tax Laws

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    could have a significant adverse effect on Key’s reported
    financial results. Although these changes may not have an
    economic impact on our business, they could affect our ability
    to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures.

We, like all businesses, are subject to tax laws, rules and
    regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
    including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
    laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue



Service or other governmental bodies, could affect us in
    substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject
    us to additional costs, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with tax laws, rules and regulations could
    result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money
    penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Severe
    Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or Terrorism And Other
    External Events Could

Significantly Impact Our Business

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
    other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
    our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
    stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
    to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
    securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
    loss of revenue

and/or

cause
    us to incur additional expenses. Although management has
    established disaster recovery plans and procedures, the
    occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Risks
    Associated With Our Common Shares

Our
    Share Price Can Be Volatile

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
    resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find
    attractive.  Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
    response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

•

Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
    operations.

•

Recommendations by securities analysts.

•

Operating and stock price performance of other companies that
    investors deem comparable to our business.

•

News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
    the financial services industry.

•

Perceptions of us

and/or

our
    competitors in the marketplace.

•

New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.

•

Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic
    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments entered into
    by us or our competitors.

•

Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated
    benefits from acquisitions.

•

Changes in government regulations.

•

Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or
    military conflicts.

General market fluctuations, industry factors and general
    economic and political conditions and events, such as economic
    slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss
    trends, could also cause our share price to decrease regardless
    of operating results.

An
    Investment In Our Common Shares Is Not An Insured
    Deposit

Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not
    insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
    fund or by any other public or private entity.  Investment in
    our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described
    in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
    report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
    price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you
    acquire our common shares, you may lose some or all of your
    investment.

Our
    Articles Of Incorporation, Regulations And Shareholders
    Rights Plan As Well As Certain Banking Laws May Have An
    Anti-Takeover Effect

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations,
    federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
    requirements, and our stock purchase rights plan could make it
    more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
    would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders.  The
    combination of these provisions may inhibit a



non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in
    turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common
    shares.

Risks
    Associated With Our Industry

The
    Earnings Of Financial Services Companies Are Significantly
    Affected By General Business And

Economic Conditions

Our operations and profitability are impacted by general
    business and economic conditions in the United States and
    abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term
    interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues,
    legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt
    and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and
    finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local
    economies in which we operate, all of which are beyond our
    control. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in
    an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets,
    decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for
    our products and services, among other things, any of which
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Financial
    Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy And Completeness Of
    Information About

Customers And Counterparties

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
    transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
    behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
    statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
    may also rely on representations of those customers,
    counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
    auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
    information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
    statements, credit reports or other financial information could
    have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Consumers
    May Decide Not To Use Banks To Complete Their Financial
    Transactions

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
    through alternative methods financial transactions that
    historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
    maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would
    have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also
    complete transactions such as paying bills

and/or

transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The
    process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
    “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
    income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
    income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
    streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the

    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s
