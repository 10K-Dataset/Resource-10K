Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
    is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a bank holding
    company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
    (“BHCA”), and are one of the nation’s largest
    bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total
    assets of $91.8 billion at December 31, 2010. KeyCorp
    is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association
    (“KeyBank”), its principal subsidiary, through which
    most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and
    certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail
    and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment
    management, consumer finance and investment banking products and
    services to individual, corporate and institutional clients
    through two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key
    Corporate Bank.

As of December 31, 2010, these services were provided
    across the country through KeyBank’s 1,033 full-service
    retail banking branches in fourteen states, additional offices,
    a telephone banking call center services group and a network of
    1,531 automated teller machines (“ATMs”) in fifteen
    states. Additional information pertaining to our two business
    segments is included in this report in Item 7.
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”), in the
    “Line of Business Results” section, and in
    Note 21 (“Line of Business Results”) of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data are
    incorporated herein by reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries
    had an average of 15,610 full-time equivalent employees for
    2010.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
    deposits and making loans, our bank and trust company
    subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
    personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
    management services, investment banking and capital markets
    products, and international banking services. Through our bank,
    trust company and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we
    provide investment management services to clients that include
    large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and
    endowments,

high-net-worth

individuals and multi-employer trust funds established for
    providing pension or other benefits to employees.

We provide other financial services — both within and
    outside of our primary banking markets — through
    various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include principal
    investing, community development financing, securities
    underwriting and brokerage, and merchant services. We also are
    an equity participant in a joint venture that provides merchant
    services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks
    and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
    security holders and its creditors to participate in any
    distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other
    subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of
    such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that
    KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be
    recognized.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 13 (“Acquisition,
    Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”) is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
    competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
    compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
    holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
    credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
    mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms,
    investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local,
    regional and national institutions that offer financial
    services. Many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory
    constraints and some may have lower cost structures. The
    financial services industry is likely to become more competitive
    as further technology advances enable more companies to provide
    financial services. Technological advances may diminish the
    importance of depository institutions and other financial
    institutions. We compete by offering quality products and
    innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining
    our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer
    preferences and industry standards.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
    concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive
    pressure on Key’s core banking products and services.
    Consolidation continued during 2010 and led to redistribution of
    deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial
    institutions. Financial institutions with liquidity challenges
    sought mergers and the



deposits and certain banking assets of the 157 banks that failed
    during 2010, representing $96.7 billion in total assets,
    were redistributed through the FDIC’s least-cost resolution
    process. These factors have intensified the concentration of the
    industry over the last few years and placed increased
    competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and
    services.

Supervision
    and Regulation

The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory
    framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial
    holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain
    specific information regarding material elements of the
    regulatory framework applicable to us. This regulatory framework
    is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors, the
    Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC and the
    banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of
    security holders and creditors. We cannot necessarily predict
    changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory
    agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on
    our business, financial condition or results of operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) under
    the BHCA. Pursuant to the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
    in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
    all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve. In addition, bank holding companies are
    generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial
    activities.

Our bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive regulation,
    supervision and examination by applicable federal banking
    agencies. We operate one full-service, FDIC-insured national
    bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national bank subsidiary whose
    activities are limited to those of a fiduciary. Both of our
    national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to
    regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). Because
    domestic deposits in KeyBank are insured (up to applicable
    limits) and certain debt obligations of KeyBank and KeyCorp are
    temporarily guaranteed by the FDIC, the FDIC also has certain
    regulatory and supervisory authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp
    under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”).

We also have other financial services subsidiaries that are
    subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve, as well as other applicable state and federal
    regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. For
    example, our brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are
    subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, the Financial
    Industry Regulatory Authority and state securities regulators,
    and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the
    insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they
    operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and
    regulations of both the federal government and the various
    states in which they are authorized to do business.

Capital
    Actions, Dividend Restrictions and the Supervisory Capital
    Assessment Program

On November 14, 2008, KeyCorp sold $2.5 billion of
    Fixed-Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B
    (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and a warrant to
    purchase 35,244,361 common shares, par value $1.00 (the
    “Warrant”), to the U.S. Treasury in conjunction
    with its CPP. The terms of the transaction with the
    U.S. Treasury include limitations on our ability to pay
    dividends and repurchase Common Shares. For three years after
    the issuance or until the U.S. Treasury no longer holds any
    Series B Preferred Stock, we will not be able to increase
    our dividends above the level paid in the third quarter of 2008,
    nor will we be permitted to repurchase any of its Common Shares
    or preferred stock without the approval of the
    U.S. Treasury, subject to the availability of certain
    limited exceptions (e.g., for purchases in connection with
    benefit plans).

The Federal Reserve advised in its Supervisory Letter SR

09-4

(revised March 27, 2009) that recipients of CPP funds
    should communicate reasonably in advance with Federal Reserve
    staff concerning how any proposed dividends, capital redemptions
    and capital repurchases are consistent with the requirements of
    CPP, and related Federal Reserve supervisory policy.
    Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s Revised Temporary
    Addendum to SR

09-4

issued
    in November 2010 (the “Revised Addendum”), outlined
    its Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (“SCAP”)
    expectations, and clarified that SCAP bank holding companies
    (“BHCs”) planned capital actions, including plans to
    repay any outstanding U.S. government investment in common
    or preferred shares, requests to increase common stock
    dividends, reinstate or increase common stock repurchase
    programs, or make other capital distributions, would be
    evaluated as part of the supervisory assessment. As with all of
    the nineteen SCAP BHCs, should we seek to raise our Common
    Shares dividend following any repayment of the
    U.S. Treasury, we must consult with the Federal Reserve and
    demonstrate that such actions are consistent with existing
    supervisory guidance.

Federal banking law and regulations also limit the amount of
    dividends that may be paid to us by our bank subsidiaries
    without regulatory approval. Historically, dividends paid to us
    by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for
    KeyCorp to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest
    on its debt. The approval of the OCC is required for the payment
    of any dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends
    declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar
    year would exceed the total of: (i) the bank’s net
    income for the current year plus (ii) the retained net
    income (as defined and



interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any
    required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any
    preferred stock. In addition, a national bank can pay dividends
    only to the extent of its undivided profits. Our national bank
    subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions. During 2010,
    KeyBank did not pay any dividends to us; nonbank subsidiaries
    paid us a total of $25 million in dividends. During 2010,
    KeyBank could not pay dividends to us without prior regulatory
    approval because KeyBank’s net losses of
    $1.151 billion for 2009 and $1.161 billion for 2008
    exceeded KeyBank’s net income during 2010. We made capital
    infusions of $100 million and $1.2 billion for 2010
    and 2009, respectively, into KeyBank in the form of cash. At
    December 31, 2010, we held $3.3 billion in short-term
    investments, which can be used to pay dividends, service debt,
    and finance corporate operations.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
    institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
    engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
    financial condition of the institution, could include the
    payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
    institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
    FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
    depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
    level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
    the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay any
    dividend: (i) if payment would cause it to become less than
    “adequately capitalized” or (ii) while it is in
    default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. For
    additional information on capital categories see the
    “Regulatory Capital Standards and Related
    Matters —Prompt Corrective Action” section below.
    Also, the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements
    that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their
    holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of
    their current operating earnings.

SCAP

The Federal Reserve’s Revised Addendum related to the
    conduct of SCAP for 2011 requested that each SCAP BHC submit its
    Comprehensive Capital Plan by January 7, 2011. The
    Comprehensive Capital Plan requirements include, among other
    things:

♦

the incorporation of stress testing with a minimum planning
    horizon of 24 months;

♦

a review of planned capital actions and pro forma estimates;

♦

management’s plans for addressing proposed revisions to the
    regulatory capital framework agreed to by the Basel Committee;

♦

a transition plan with pro forma estimates of regulatory capital
    ratios under the Basel III framework over the phase-in
    period; and

♦

detail supporting the actions and assumptions to be taken over
    the entire period necessary for the BHC to meet the fully
    phased-in 7% Tier 1 common equity target.

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is required
    beginning in 2012 to perform an annual supervisory assessment of
    certain covered BHCs and non-banks, and these same financial
    companies will be required to conduct semi-annual stress tests.
    Currently, we conduct stress testing on a quarterly basis. The
    Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to issue
    regulations concerning its supervisory assessment and stress
    testing by January 2012, which must: (1) prescribe that
    three scenarios be used in the stress test—baseline,
    adverse, and severely adverse; (2) establish the
    methodologies for the conduct of the test; (3) establish
    the form and content of the report required to be submitted to
    the Federal Reserve and the financial institution’s primary
    regulator; and (4) require companies to publish a summary
    of the required stress test. These regulations have yet to be
    issued.

Holding
    Company Structure

Bank Transactions with Affiliates.

Federal banking
    law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose
    qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain
    transactions by a bank with its affiliates. Transactions covered
    by these provisions must be on arm’s length terms, and
    cannot exceed certain amounts, determined with reference to the
    bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if a loan or other
    extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an
    amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute. These
    provisions materially restrict the ability of KeyBank, as a
    bank, to fund its affiliates including KeyCorp, KeyBanc Capital
    Markets Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds, and
    KeyCorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making
    merchant banking investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under the Dodd-Frank
    Act and long-standing Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding
    company is expected to serve as a source of financial and
    managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under
    appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each
    such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at a time
    when we may not have the resources to, or would choose not to,
    provide it. Certain loans by a bank holding company to a
    subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits
    in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In
    addition, federal law provides that in the event of a
    bankruptcy, any commitment by a bank holding company to a
    federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a
    subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and
    entitled to a priority of payment.



Regulatory
    Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory Capital.

Federal
    law defines and prescribes minimum levels of regulatory capital
    for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy
    of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal
    banking agencies in the examination and supervision process, and
    in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific
    transactions and activities, including acquisitions, expansion
    of existing activities and commencement of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve. These guidelines
    establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to risk-weighted
    assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are calculated by
    assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories of assets and
    off-balance sheet exposures, based primarily on counterparty
    credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital
    ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by
    risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The required minimum
    total risk-based capital ratio is currently 8.00%. It is
    calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount of
    Tier 1 capital), after certain deductions, by risk-weighted
    assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
    preferred equity (including the Series A Preferred Stock
    and the Series B Preferred Stock), and minority interests
    in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain
    intangible assets (including goodwill) and certain other assets.
    Tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital
    instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt
    securities, perpetual preferred equity not includable in
    Tier 1 capital, limited amounts of term subordinated debt,
    and medium-term preferred equity, certain unrealized holding
    gains on certain equity securities, and the allowance for loan
    and lease losses, limited as a percentage of net risk-weighted
    assets.

Bank holding companies, whose securities and commodities trading
    activities exceed specified levels also are required to maintain
    capital for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the
    market value of trading account, foreign exchange, and commodity
    positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such
    as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity
    prices, foreign exchange rates, or commodity prices) or from
    position specific factors (such as idiosyncratic variation,
    event risk, and default risk).

On January 11, 2011, the federal banking agencies published
    a proposal to revise their market risk capital rules. The
    proposal would modify the scope of such rules to better capture
    positions for which the market risk capital rules are
    appropriate, reduce pro-cyclicality in market risk capital
    requirements, enhance the rules’ sensitivity to risks that
    are not adequately captured under the current regulatory
    measurement methodologies, and increase transparency through
    enhanced disclosures. The proposal does not include the
    methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
    Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) for calculating
    the specific risk capital requirements for debt and
    securitization positions because those methodologies relay on
    credit ratings, which is impermissible under the Dodd-Frank Act.
    Consequently, the proposal retains the current specific risk
    treatment for these positions until the agencies develop
    alternative standards of creditworthiness as required by the
    Dodd-Frank Act. At December 31, 2010, we had regulatory
    capital in excess of all minimum risk-based requirements,
    including all required adjustments for market risk.

In addition to the risk-based standards, bank holding companies
    are subject to the Federal Reserve’s leverage ratio
    guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 risk-based capital to total assets. The minimum
    leverage ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by
    average total consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding
    companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or
    have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital
    measure for market risk. All other bank holding companies must
    maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. At
    December 31, 2010, Key had regulatory capital in excess of
    all minimum leverage capital requirements, and satisfied the
    SCAP requirements set forth in supervisory guidance.

Our national bank subsidiaries are also subject to risk-based
    and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC, which are
    substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal Reserve on
    bank holding companies. At December 31, 2010, each of our
    national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of
    all minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
    to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
    that are not taken into account in the computation of the
    capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
    evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
    adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
    regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
    organization. Neither the Federal Reserve nor the OCC has
    advised us or any of our national bank subsidiaries of any
    specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratios
    applicable to us or such national bank subsidiary.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The federal banking
    agencies are required to take prompt corrective action in
    respect of depository institutions, that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements under federal law. Such prompt corrective
    action includes imposing progressively more restrictions on
    operations, management, and capital distributions as an
    institution’s capital decreases. FDIC-insured depository
    institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective
    action capital categories — well capitalized,
    adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
    undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized —
    using the Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and
    Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital
    measures. An institution is considered well



capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
    least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
    6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
    and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
    directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure. At December 31, 2010, KeyBank was well
    capitalized under the prompt corrective action standards.
    Federal law also requires that the bank regulatory agencies
    implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for
    institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements
    within the five capital categories, with progressively more
    restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions.

Bank holding companies are not grouped into any of the five
    capital categories applicable to insured depository
    institutions. If such categories applied to bank holding
    companies, we believe that KeyCorp would satisfy the well
    capitalized criteria at December 31, 2010. An
    institution’s prompt corrective action capital category,
    however, may not constitute an accurate representation of the
    overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or
    parent bank holding company, and should be considered in
    conjunction with other available information regarding the
    financial condition and results of operations of the institution
    and its parent bank holding company.

Basel
    Accords

Overview

The current minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by
    the U.S. federal banking agencies are based on a 1988
    international accord (“Basel I”) that was developed by
    the Basel Committee. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a
    new capital framework document (“Basel II”) governing
    the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking
    organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
    management and measurement systems. Basel II is designed to
    create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk
    measurement and management processes and to better align minimum
    capital requirements with the risks underlying their activities.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
    capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
    supervisory review, and market discipline. In December 2007,
    U.S. federal banking regulators issued a final rule for
    Basel II implementation, requiring banks with over
    $250 billion in consolidated total assets or on-balance
    sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion (core banks) to adopt
    the advanced approach of Basel II while allowing other
    institutions to elect to opt-in. Currently, neither KeyCorp nor
    KeyBank is required to apply this final rule.

Basel III
    Capital Framework

In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final
    framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity
    regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III is a
    comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the
    regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking
    sector. These measures aim to improve the banking sector’s
    ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic
    stress, whatever the source, improve risk management and
    governance, and strengthen banks’ transparency and
    disclosures. Basel III requires higher and better-quality
    capital, better risk coverage, the introduction of an
    international leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk-based
    requirement, measures to promote the build up of capital that
    can be drawn down in periods of stress, and the introduction of
    two global liquidity standards.

The Basel III final capital framework, among other things:

•

introduces as a new capital measure, “common equity
    Tier 1,” and specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of
    common equity Tier 1 and “additional Tier 1
    capital” instruments meeting specified requirements;

•

when fully phased in on January 1, 2019, will require banks
    to maintain: (a) a minimum ratio of common equity
    Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a
    2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which effectively
    results in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to
    risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (b) a Tier 1
    capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6%, plus the
    capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0%
    Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in,
    effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of
    8.5% upon full implementation); (c) a minimum ratio of
    total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to
    risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital
    conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total
    capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (d) a
    minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of
    Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain
    off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of
    the month-end ratios for the quarter);

•

provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer”,
    generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that
    excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup
    of systemic risk, that would be a common equity Tier 1
    add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to
    2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total
    buffers of between 2.5% and 5%); and



•

the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses
    during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a
    ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above
    the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the
    combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital
    buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on
    dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the
    amount of the short fall.

The implementation of the Basel III final capital framework
    will commence January 1, 2013. On that date, banks with
    regulators adopting these standards in full would be required to
    meet the following minimum capital ratios – 3.5%
    common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, 4.5%
    Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% total
    capital to risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the
    capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016
    at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing
    by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it
    reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).

The Basel III final framework provides for a number of new
    deductions from and adjustments to common equity Tier 1.
    These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage
    servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future
    taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated
    financial entities be deducted from common equity Tier 1 to
    the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of common
    equity Tier 1 or all such categories in the aggregate
    exceed 15% of common equity Tier 1. Implementation of the
    deductions and other adjustments to common equity Tier 1
    will begin on January 1, 2014 and will be phased-in over a
    five-year period (20% per year).

Basel III
    Liquidity Framework

The Basel III final liquidity framework requires banks to
    comply with two measures of liquidity risk exposure:

•

the “liquidity coverage ratio”, based on a

30-day

time
    horizon and calculated as the ratio of the “stock of
    high-quality liquid assets” divided by “total net cash
    outflows over the next 30 calendar days”, which must be at
    least 100%; and

•

the “net stable funding ratio”, calculated as the
    ratio of the “available amount of stable funding”
    divided by the “required amount of stable funding”,
    which must be at least 100%.

Each of the components of these ratios is defined, and the ratio
    calculated, in accordance with detailed requirements in the
    Basel III liquidity framework. Although the Basel Committee
    has not asked for additional comment on these ratios, both are
    subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements.
    The Basel III liquidity framework provides specifically
    that revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio will be made by
    mid-2013, with such ratios being introduced as a requirement on
    January 1, 2015, revisions to the net stable funding ratio
    will be made by mid-2016, and the net stable funding ratio will
    be introduced as a requirement on January 1, 2018.

On January 13, 2011, the Basel Committee issued its final
    “minimum requirements to ensure loss absorbency at the
    point non-viability” document. It requires that all
    non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments (e.g.,
    non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and subordinated debt)
    issued by an internationally active bank must have a provision
    that such instruments, at the option of the relevant regulator,
    are to either be written-off or converted into common equity
    upon the occurrence of certain trigger events. The final loss
    absorbency requirements specify that instruments issued on or
    after January 1, 2013, must meet the new criteria to be
    included in regulatory capital. Instruments issued prior to
    January 1, 2013, that do not meet the criteria, but that
    meet all of the entry criteria for additional Tier 1 or
    Tier 2 capital, will be considered as instruments that no
    longer qualify as additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital
    and will be phased out from January 1, 2013 in accordance
    with the Basel III framework. These provisions are similar
    to the concept set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act of phasing out of
    trust preferred securities, cumulative preferred securities and
    certain other securities as Tier 1 capital over a
    three-year period beginning January 1, 2013, as well as the
    application of similar capital standards to BHCs as are
    currently applied to depository institutions.

The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a
    formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final
    adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. However, they
    have indicated informally that a notice of proposed rulemaking
    likely will be released in mid-2011, with final amendments to
    regulations becoming effective in mid-2012. Given our strong
    capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the
    Basel III capital framework should U.S. capital
    regulations corresponding to it be finalized. While we also have
    a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity
    framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate
    additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding
    additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our
    product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits.
    U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make
    certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework.
    Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess the impact
    of the Basel III liquidity framework.



Federal
    Deposit Insurance Act

Deposit
    Insurance Coverage Limits.

Throughout 2010, the FDIC standard maximum depositor insurance
    coverage limit was $250,000. This limit, which was made
    permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act, applies per depositor, per
    insured depository institution, for each account ownership
    category. Also under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by H.R.
    6398, the FDIC is required to provide temporary unlimited
    coverage for qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction
    accounts, including Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts.
    This temporary unlimited coverage is effective from
    December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012.

Deposit
    Insurance Assessments

Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are
    insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The FDIC assesses
    an insured depository institution an amount for deposit
    insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment
    base times a risk-based assessment rate. Under the risk-based
    assessment system in effect during 2010, annualized deposit
    insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775 for each
    $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the
    institution’s risk category. This system will remain in
    effect for the first quarter of 2011. In 2009, the FDIC amended
    its assessment regulations to require insured depository
    institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their
    estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009,
    and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. KeyBank’s assessment
    prepayment was $539 million. For 2010, our FDIC insurance
    assessment was $124 million. As of December 31, 2010,
    we had $388 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessment
    recorded on our balance sheet.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to change the assessment
    base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets
    minus average tangible equity, and requires the DIF reserve
    ratio to increase to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, rather
    than 1.15% by December 31, 2016, as previously required. To
    implement these and other changes to the current deposit
    insurance assessment regime, the FDIC issued several proposed
    rules in 2010. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted their
    final rule on assessments. Under the final rule, which is
    effective on April 1, 2011, KeyBank’s annualized
    deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to
    $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its
    new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBank’s
    regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding
    related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to
    the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate
    that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be
    $60 to $90 million.

FICO
    Assessments

All FDIC-insured depository institutions have been required
    through assessments collected by the FDIC to service the annual
    interest on certain

30-year

noncallable bonds issued by the Financing Corporation
    (“FICO”) to fund losses incurred in the 1980s by the
    former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. For 2010,
    the annualized FICO assessment rate ranged from $.0104 to $.0106
    for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits.

Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program

In 2008, the FDIC implemented its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program (the “TLGP”). The TLGP has two components: a
    “Debt Guarantee Program” temporarily guaranteeing the
    unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of
    qualifying newly-issued senior unsecured debt of participating
    eligible entities, and a “Transaction Account
    Guarantee” providing a temporary guarantee of depositor
    funds in qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts
    maintained at participating FDIC-insured depository
    institutions. For FDIC-guaranteed debt issued before
    April 1, 2009, the Debt Guarantee expires on the earlier of
    the maturity of the debt or June 30, 2012. For
    FDIC-guaranteed debt issued on or after April 1, 2009, the
    Debt Guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the
    debt or December 31, 2012. The Transaction Account
    Guarantee expired on December 31, 2010. As of
    December 31, 2010, KeyCorp had $687.5 million of
    guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP and KeyBank had
    $1.0 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP.
    KeyBank participated in the Transaction Account Guarantee
    component of the TLGP during the first half of 2010.

Liability
    of Commonly Controlled Institutions

Under the FDIA, an insured depository institution generally is
    liable to the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably
    anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the
    default of any commonly controlled insured institution, or for
    any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled
    institution that is in danger of default. The term
    “default” is defined generally to mean the appointment
    of a conservator or receiver and the term “in danger of
    default” is defined generally as the existence of certain
    conditions indicating that a “default” is likely to
    occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.



Conservatorship
    and Receivership of Institutions

If any insured depository institution becomes insolvent and the
    FDIC is appointed its conservator or receiver, the FDIC may,
    under federal law, disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which
    such institution is a party if the FDIC determines that
    performance of the contract would be burdensome, and that
    disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the
    orderly administration of the institution’s affairs. Such
    disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by the
    other party to the contract against the receivership or
    conservatorship. The amount paid upon such claim would depend
    upon, among other factors, the amount of receivership assets
    available for the payment of such claim and the priority of the
    claim relative to the priority of others. In addition, the FDIC
    as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered
    into by the institution notwithstanding any provision regarding
    termination, default, acceleration, or exercise of rights upon
    or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution,
    appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or
    exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for
    the institution. The FDIC as conservator or receiver also may
    transfer any asset or liability of the institution without
    obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s
    shareholders or creditors.

Depositor
    Preference

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other
    resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of
    its depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of
    insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative
    expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority
    over other general unsecured claims against such an institution.
    If an insured depository institution fails, insured and
    uninsured depositors along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of
    unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including a parent holding
    company and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of
    payment.

Regulatory
    Reform Developments

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act
    into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to address perceived
    deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial
    services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures
    and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against
    or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic
    risk through increased supervision of systemically important
    financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The
    Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes
    across the financial landscape affecting financial companies,
    including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a
    review of the various reform measures being taken as a result of
    the Dodd-Frank Act, we refer you to the risk factor on the
    Dodd-Frank Act on page 12 in Item 1A: Risk Factors.

The Dodd-Frank Act defers many of the details of its mandated
    reforms to future rulemakings by a variety of federal regulatory
    agencies. For further detail on the Dodd-Frank Act, see Pub. L.

111-203,

H.R. 4173 (for the full text of the Act).

Entry
    Into Certain Covenants

We entered into two transactions during 2006 and one transaction
    (with an overallotment option) in 2008, each of which involved
    the issuance of trust preferred securities
    (“Trust Preferred Securities”) by Delaware
    statutory trusts formed by us (the “Trusts”), as
    further described below. Simultaneously with the closing of each
    of those transactions, we entered into a so-called replacement
    capital covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital
    Covenant” and collectively, the “Replacement Capital
    Covenants”) for the benefit of persons that buy or hold
    specified series of long-term indebtedness of KeyCorp or its
    then largest depository institution, KeyBank (the “Covered
    Debt”). Each of the Replacement Capital Covenants provide
    that neither KeyCorp nor any of its subsidiaries (including any
    of the Trusts) will redeem or purchase all or any part of the
    Trust Preferred Securities or certain junior subordinated
    debentures issued by KeyCorp and held by the Trust (the
    “Junior Subordinated Debentures”), as applicable, on
    or before the date specified in the applicable Replacement
    Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions, except to the
    extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date of that
    redemption or purchase, we have received proceeds from the sale
    of qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the Trust Preferred
    Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, as applicable,
    at the time of redemption or purchase, and (ii) we have
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, if such
    approval is then required by the Federal Reserve. We will
    provide a copy of the Replacement Capital Covenants to holders

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

An investment in our Common Shares or other securities is
    subject to risks inherent to our business, ownership of our
    securities and our industry. Described below are certain risks
    and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could have a material
    and adverse effect on us. Before making an investment decision,
    you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
    described below together with all of the other information
    included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks
    and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
    Although we have significant risk management policies,
    procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks,
    uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations.
    This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO
    LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
    AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS
    WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON
    SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B PREFERRED
    STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND DEBT
    SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND
    YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

Risks
    Related To Our Business

Our
    credit ratings affect our liquidity position.

On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced a ratings
    downgrade for ten large U.S. regional banks, including
    KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from systemic
    support. Ratings for KeyBank’s short-term borrowings,
    senior long-term debt and subordinated debt were downgraded one
    notch—from

P-1

to

P-2,

A2 to
    A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. In conjunction with the
    ratings changes, Moody’s updated their ratings outlook on
    these ratings from “Negative” to “Stable.”
    The new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by
    Moody’s in connection with the securitizations that we
    service, and impact the ability of KeyBank to hold certain
    escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage
    securitizations serviced by us and rated by Moody’s. These
    escrow deposit balances range from $1.50 to $1.85 billion.
    Since the downgrade, KeyBank has been in discussions with
    Moody’s regarding an alternative investment vehicle for
    these funds that would be acceptable to Moody’s and
    maintain the funds at KeyBank. Subsequent to Moody’s
    announcement that was issued on January 19, 2011,
    Moody’s indicated to KeyBank that these escrow deposit
    balances associated with our mortgage servicing operations will
    need to be moved to another financial institution which meets
    the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of 2011.
    As a result of this decision by Moody’s, KeyBank has
    determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in
    an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets.
    KeyBank expects to have ample liquidity reserves to offset the
    loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong
    liquidity position. Nevertheless, the ratings downgrade could
    decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to
    lend to us.



Our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of KeyCorp
    and KeyBank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other
    securities are based on a number of factors, including our
    financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other
    factors, some of which are not entirely within our control, such
    as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the
    economy. In light of the difficulties in the financial services
    industry, the financial markets and the economy, there can be no
    assurance that we will maintain our current ratings.

If the securities of KeyCorp

and/or

KeyBank suffer additional ratings downgrades, such downgrades
    could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could
    significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional
    collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of
    investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, thereby
    reducing our ability to generate income. Further downgrades of
    the credit ratings of securities, particularly if they are below
    investment-grade, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    Federal Reserve has acknowledged the possibility of further
    recession and deflation. Should this occur, the financial
    services industry and our business could be adversely
    affected.

Despite the conclusion of the recession, the recovery of the
    U.S. economy continues to progress slowly; consumer
    confidence remains low, unemployment remains high at 9.4% for
    December 2010, and the housing market remains an important
    downside risk, with prices expected to fall through much of this
    year. Given the concerns about the U.S. economy,
    U.S. employers continue to approach hiring with caution,
    and as a result unemployment may rise. Furthermore, the Federal
    Open Market Committee communicated in its December
    2010 statement that measures of underlying inflation have
    continued to trend downward. Monetary and fiscal policy
    measures, including the recent legislation formalizing the tax
    compromise between U.S. Congress and Senate members (the
    “Tax Compromise”), aimed at lowering the risk of a
    double-dip recession may be insufficient to strengthen the
    recovery, return unemployment to lower levels, and restore
    stability to the financial markets. Furthermore, Federal Reserve
    Chairman Bernanke and various governments in Europe have
    acknowledged the need to commence a shift from fiscal stimulus
    efforts to fiscal constraint to reduce government deficits. The
    recent Tax Compromise indicates that the shift in
    U.S. fiscal policy will be postponed, but only temporarily.
    A coordinated shift from fiscal stimulus to fiscal reductions
    could hinder the return of a robust global economy and cause
    instability in the financial markets. Various governments in
    Europe have announced budget reductions

and/or

austerity measures as a means to limit fiscal budget deficits as
    a result of the economic crisis. Additionally, many state and
    local governments in the U.S. have also implemented budget
    reductions. These factors could weaken the U.S. economic
    recovery. A weak U.S. economic recovery could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us. Should economic indicators not
    improve, the U.S. could face a further recession and
    deflation. Such economic conditions could affect us in a variety
    of substantial and unpredictable ways as well as affect our
    borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations.
    These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    failure of the European Union to stabilize its weaker member
    economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland,
    and Italy, could have international implications affecting the
    stability of global financial markets and hindering the U.S.
    economic recovery.

On the eve of May 10, 2010, Greece was facing imminent
    default on its obligations. On May 10, 2010, finance
    ministers from the European Union announced a deal to provide
    $560 billion in new loans and $76 billion under an
    existing lending program to countries facing instability. The
    International Monetary Fund joined forces and announced that it
    was prepared to give $321 billion separately. The European
    Central Bank also announced that it would buy government and
    corporate debt, and the world’s leading central banks,
    including the Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada, Bank of England,
    Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank, announced a joint
    intervention to make more dollars available for interbank
    lending. These and other monetary and fiscal policy efforts
    appear to have stabilized the European Union’s weaker
    member economies. Nevertheless, should these monetary and fiscal
    policy measures be insufficient to restore stability to the
    financial markets, the recovery of the U.S. economy could
    be hindered or reversed, which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

The
    Dodd-Frank Act subjects us to a variety of new and more
    stringent legal and regulatory requirements. Because the
    Dodd-Frank Act imposes more stringent regulatory requirements on
    the largest financial institutions, Key could be competitively
    disadvantaged.

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act
    into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to address perceived
    deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial
    services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures
    and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against
    or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic
    risk through increased supervision of systemically important
    financial companies (including nonbank financial companies).
    Although many provisions remain subject to further rulemaking,
    the Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes
    across the



financial landscape affecting financial companies, including
    bank and bank-holding companies such as Key, by, among other
    things:

•

Requiring regulation and oversight of large, systemically
    important financial institutions by establishing an interagency
    council, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
    (“FSOC”), to identify and manage systemic risk in the
    financial system, and requiring the implementation of heightened
    prudential standards and regulation by the Federal Reserve for
    systemically important financial institutions (including nonbank
    financial companies);

•

Applying prudential standards to large interconnected financial
    companies, including BHCs like us that have at least
    $50 billion in total consolidated assets and certain
    nonbanks regulated by the Federal Reserve. Such heightened
    prudential standards must include risk-based capital
    requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, overall
    risk management requirements, resolution plan and credit
    exposure reporting, and concentration limits. They also may
    include a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public
    disclosures, short-term debt limits, and such other standards as
    the Federal Reserve, on its own or pursuant to FSOC
    recommendation, determines are appropriate;

•

Requiring that large interconnected financial companies with at
    least $50 billion in total assets prepare and maintain a
    rapid and orderly resolution plan, which must be approved by the
    Federal Reserve and the FDIC;

•

Creating a new federal receivership process pursuant to which
    the FDIC will serve as receiver for large, interconnected
    financial companies, including bank holding companies, whose
    failure poses a significant risk to the financial stability of
    the United States. All costs of an orderly liquidation are borne
    first by shareholders and unsecured creditors, and, if
    necessary, by risk-based assessments on large financial
    companies;

•

Applying the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements
    that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank
    holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and
    systemically important nonbank financial companies, which, among
    other things, will gradually exclude all trust preferred and
    cumulative preferred securities from Tier 1 capital, and may
    impose new capital and liquidity requirements consistent with
    the Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks;

•

Limiting the Federal Reserve’s emergency authority to lend
    to nondepository institutions to facilities with broad-based
    eligibility, and authorizing the FDIC to establish an emergency
    financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions
    and their holding companies, subject to the approval of
    Congress, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Federal
    Reserve;

•

Centralizing responsibility for consumer financial protection by
    creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
    (the “CFPB”), with responsibility for implementing,
    examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer
    financial laws, a number of which will be strengthened by
    provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated
    thereunder;

•

Imposing new regulatory requirements and restrictions on
    federally insured depository institutions, their holding
    companies and other affiliates, as well as other systemically
    important nonbank financial companies, including the so-called
    “Volcker Rule” ban on proprietary trading and
    sponsorship of, and investment in hedge funds and private equity
    funds;

•

Creating regimes for regulation of

over-the-counter

derivatives and non-admitted property and casualty insurers and
    reinsurers. The regulation of

over-the-counter

derivatives shall include the so-called “Lincoln push-out
    provision” that effectively prohibits insured depository
    institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in
    the institution;

•

Requiring any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit
    transaction to be “reasonable” and proportional to the
    cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction, directing the
    Federal Reserve to prescribe new regulations establishing such
    fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between
    issuers and networks for debit card transactions, and imposing
    limits for restrictions on merchant discounting for the use of
    certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds
    as a condition for acceptance of credit cards;

•

Implementing regulation of hedge fund and private equity
    advisers by requiring that advisers that manage
    $150 million or more in assets to register with the SEC;



•

Requiring issuers of asset-backed securities to retain some of
    the risk associated with the offered securities;

•

Providing for the implementation of corporate governance
    provisions for all public companies concerning proxy access and
    executive compensation;

•

Increasing the FDIC’s deposit insurance limits permanently
    to $250,000 for non-transaction accounts, providing for
    unlimited federal deposit insurance on non-interest bearing
    demand transaction accounts at all insured depository
    institutions effective December 31, 2010 through
    December 31, 2012, and changing the assessment base from
    insured deposits to average consolidated assets less average
    tangible equity, eliminating the ceiling on the size of the DIF,
    increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF, and imposing
    assessments upon bank holding companies to support the cost of
    resolution and regulation of such entities required by the
    Dodd-Frank Act;

•

Reforming regulation of credit rating agencies, and requiring
    federal agencies to remove references to credit ratings as a
    measure of creditworthiness for, among other things, purposes of
    capital, analysis of credits, and liquidity; and

•

Repealing the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on
    demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to
    pay interest on business transaction accounts.

The Dodd-Frank Act defers many of the details of its mandated
    reforms to future rulemakings by a variety of federal regulatory
    agencies. While we cannot predict the effect of these various
    rulemakings which have yet to be issued, we do anticipate a
    variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory
    requirements. Regulatory reform will likely place additional
    costs on larger financial institutions, may impede growth
    opportunities, and may place larger financial institutions at a
    competitive disadvantage in the market place. Additionally,
    reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that we deal
    with in the course of our business, such as rating agencies,
    insurance companies, and investors. Heightened regulatory
    practices, requirements or expectations resulting from the
    Dodd-Frank Act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect
    us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    Dodd-Frank Act provides for the phase-out beginning
    January 1, 2013, of trust preferred securities and
    cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1
    risk-based capital for purposes of the regulatory capital
    guidelines for bank holding companies.

Currently, our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred
    securities represent 15% of our Tier 1 risk-based capital
    or $1.8 billion of our $11.8 billion of Tier 1
    risk-based capital. By comparison, the U.S. Treasury’s
    CPP investment, non-cumulative perpetual preferred securities,
    and our common equity represent 21%, 2% and 62%, respectively,
    of our Tier 1 risk-based capital, as of December 31,
    2010. The anticipated phase-out (as eligible Tier 1
    risk-based capital) of our trust preferred securities and
    enhanced trust preferred securities will eventually result in us
    having less of a capital buffer above the current
    well-capitalized regulatory standard of 6% of Tier 1
    risk-based capital. Accordingly, we may eventually determine it
    is advisable or our regulators could require us, based upon new
    capital or liquidity regulations or otherwise, to raise
    additional Tier 1 risk-based capital through the issuance
    of additional preferred stock or common equity. Should such
    issuances occur, they would likely result in dilution to our
    shareholders. Currently, we expect to have sufficient access to
    the capital markets to be able to raise any necessary
    replacement capital. Nevertheless, should market conditions
    deteriorate, our ability to raise capital may be diminished
    significantly, which could, in turn, have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us. Approximately $140 billion of trust preferred
    securities issued by U.S. financial institutions will be
    affected by the Dodd-Frank Act phase-out of trust preferred
    securities as Tier 1 eligible. Many other institutions are
    faced with this same issue. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act and
    related or other rulemaking may result in new regulatory capital
    standards for institutions to be recognized as well-capitalized.
    These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

An
    offering of a significant amount of additional Common Shares or
    equity convertible into our Common Shares could cause us to
    issue a significant amount of Common Shares to a private
    investor or group of private investors and thus have a
    significant investor with voting rights.

Any issuance or issuances totaling a significant amount of our
    Common Shares or equity convertible into our Common Shares could
    cause us to issue a significant amount of Common Shares to a
    private investor or group of investors and thus have a
    significant investor with voting rights. Having a significant
    shareholder may make some future transactions more difficult or
    perhaps impossible to complete without the support of such
    shareholder. The interests of the significant shareholder may
    not coincide with our interests or the interests of other
    shareholders. There can be no assurance that any significant
    shareholder will exercise its influence in our best interests as
    opposed to its best interests as a significant shareholder.
    Accordingly, a significant shareholder may make it difficult to
    approve certain transactions even if they are supported by the
    other shareholders. These factors could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.



We are
    subject to market risks, including in the commercial real estate
    sector. Should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate
    market further deteriorate, our financial condition and results
    of operations could be adversely affected.

The fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector remain
    weak, under continuing pressure by reduced asset values, high
    vacancies and reduced rents. Commercial real estate values
    peaked in the fall of 2007, after gaining approximately 30%
    since 2005 and 90% since 2001. According to Moody’s Real
    Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Index (December 2010),
    commercial real estate values were down 42% from their peak.
    Many of our commercial real estate loans were originated between
    2005 and 2007. A portion of our commercial real estate loans are
    construction loans. These properties are typically not fully
    leased at the origination of the loan, but the borrower may be
    reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to
    provide cash flow to support debt service payments. Weak
    economic conditions typically slow the execution of new leases;
    such conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As we
    experienced during 2010, vacancy rates for retail, office and
    industrial space are expected to remain elevated and could
    increase in 2011. Increased vacancies could result in rents
    falling further over the next several quarters. The combination
    of these factors could result in further weakening in the
    fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market.
    Should these fundamentals continue to deteriorate as a result of
    further decline in asset values and the instability of rental
    income, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Declining
    asset prices could adversely affect us.

During the recent recession in December 2007 to June 2009, the
    volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets
    have experienced reached extreme levels. The severe market
    dislocations in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial
    financial institutions, causing widespread liquidation of assets
    and further constraining credit markets. These asset sales,
    along with asset sales by other leveraged investors, including
    some hedge funds, rapidly drove down prices and valuations
    across a wide variety of traded asset classes. Asset price
    deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of
    the asset categories represented on our balance sheet, and
    reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable.
    For example, a further recession would likely reverse recent
    positive trends in asset prices. These factors could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to credit risk, in the form of changes in interest rates
    and/or changes in the economic conditions in the markets where
    we operate, which changes could adversely affect us.

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
    activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
    of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
    conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
    interest rates

and/or

further weakening of economic conditions caused by a double-dip
    recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of
    borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the
    collateral securing these loans.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 69% of our loan
    portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
    loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
    mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
    types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate
    loans and consumer loans. We closely monitor and manage risk
    concentrations and utilize various portfolio management
    practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible
    to do so; however, our loan portfolio still contains a number of
    commercial loans with relatively large balances.

We also do business with environmentally sensitive industries
    and in connection with the development of Brownfield sites that
    provide appropriate business opportunities. We monitor and
    evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmental-related
    covenants, which include covenants requiring compliance with
    applicable law. We take steps to mitigate risks; however, should
    political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our
    customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants, our
    credit quality could be adversely affected. The deterioration of
    one or more of any of our loans could cause a significant
    increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in net loss
    of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for
    loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, any
    of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect
    our lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws
    and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement
    action that could result in the assessment against us of civil
    money or other penalties, which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

There can
    be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives
    undertaken by the United States government to restore liquidity
    and stability to the U.S. financial system and reform financial
    regulation in the U.S. will help stabilize the U.S. financial
    system.

Since 2008, the federal government has intervened in an
    unprecedented manner in response to the recent financial crisis
    that affected the banking system and financial markets. The EESA
    was enacted and signed into law by President Bush in October
    2008 in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the
    banking system and financial markets and going concern threats
    to investment banks and other financial institutions. Under the
    authority provided by EESA, the U.S. Treasury established
    the CPP, and the core provisions of the Financial Stability Plan
    aimed at stabilizing and providing liquidity to the financial
    markets. There



can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the EESA,
    the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
    (“Recovery Bill”), the Dodd-Frank Act, the Tax
    Compromise, or other programs and initiatives undertaken by the
    U.S. government will have on the financial markets. In
    addition, the Federal Reserve has implemented a variety of
    monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy. Nevertheless,
    the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability
    experienced in late 2008 and through the third quarter of
    2009 may return or persist. During the liquidity crisis
    from late 2007 to 2009, regional financial institutions faced
    difficulties issuing debt in the fixed income debt markets;
    these conditions could return and pose continued difficulties
    for the issuance of both medium term note and long-term
    subordinated note issuances. The failure of the
    U.S. government programs to sufficiently contribute to
    financial market stability and put the U.S. economy on a
    stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening
    of current financial market conditions, which could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us. In the event that any of the
    various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets
    return or become exacerbated, there may be a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us from (1) continued or accelerated disruption
    and volatility in financial markets, (2) continued capital
    and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions
    generally and our transaction counterparties specifically,
    (3) limitations resulting from further governmental action
    to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial
    system, or (4) recessionary conditions that return, are
    deeper, or last longer than currently anticipated.

Issuing a
    significant amount of common equity to a private investor may
    result in a change in control of KeyCorp under regulatory
    standards and contractual terms.

Should we obtain a significant amount of additional capital from
    any individual private investor, a change of control could occur
    under applicable regulatory standards and contractual terms.
    Such change of control may trigger notice, approval

and/or

other
    regulatory requirements in many states and jurisdictions in
    which we operate. We are a party to various contracts and other
    agreements that may require us to obtain consents from our
    respective contract counterparties in the event of a change in
    control. The failure to obtain any required regulatory consents
    or approvals or contractual consents due to a change in control
    may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Should we
    decide to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s Series B
    Preferred Stock, future issuance(s) of Common Shares may be
    necessary, which, if necessary, may result in significant
    dilution to holders of KeyCorp Common Shares.

In conjunction with any repurchase of the Series B
    Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, we may elect
    or be required by our regulators to increase the amount of our
    Tier 1 common equity through the sale of additional Common
    Shares. In addition, in connection with the
    U.S. Treasury’s purchase of the Series B
    Preferred Stock, pursuant to a Letter Agreement dated
    November 14, 2008, and the Securities Purchase
    Agreement — Standard Terms, the U.S. Treasury
    received a Warrant to purchase 35,244,361 of our Common Shares
    at an initial per share exercise price of $10.64, subject to
    adjustment, which expires ten years from the issuance date, and
    we have agreed to provide the U.S. Treasury with
    registration rights covering the Warrant and the underlying
    Common Shares. The terms of the Warrant provide for a procedure,
    upon repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock, to
    determine the value of the Warrant, and purchase the Warrant,
    within approximately 40 days of the repurchase of the
    Series B Preferred Stock. However, even if we were to
    redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, there is no assurance
    that this Warrant will be fully retired and, therefore, that it
    will not be exercised, prior to its expiration date. The
    issuance of additional Common Shares as a result of the exercise
    of the Warrant the U.S. Treasury holds would likely dilute
    the ownership interest of KeyCorp’s existing common
    shareholders.

The terms of the Warrant provide that, if we issue Common Shares
    or securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable
    for Common Shares at a price that is less than 90% of the market
    price of such shares on the last trading day preceding the date
    of the agreement to sell such shares, the number and the per
    share price of Common Shares to be purchased pursuant to the
    Warrant will be adjusted pursuant to its terms. We may also
    choose to issue securities convertible into or exercisable for
    our Common Shares and such securities may themselves contain
    anti-dilution provisions. Such anti-dilution adjustment
    provisions may have a further dilutive effect on other holders
    of our Common Shares.

There can be no assurance that we will not in the future
    determine that it is advisable, or that we will not encounter
    circumstances where we determine that it is necessary, to issue
    additional Common Shares, securities convertible into or
    exchangeable for Common Shares or common-equivalent securities
    to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to
    build additional capital. Nevertheless, there can be no
    assurance that our regulators, including the U.S. Treasury
    and the Federal Reserve, will not conduct additional
    “stress test” capital assessments outside of typical
    examination cycles, such as the SCAP,

and/or

require us to generate additional capital, including Tier 1
    common equity, in the future in the event of further negative
    economic circumstances, in order for us to redeem our
    Series B Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury
    under the CPP or otherwise. The market price of our Common
    Shares could decline as a result of such exchange offerings, as
    well as other sales of a large block of our Common Shares or
    similar securities in the market thereafter, or the perception
    that such sales could occur. These factors could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.



We may
    not be permitted to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s CPP
    investment if and when we request approval to do so.

While it is our plan to repurchase the Series B Preferred
    Stock as soon as practicable, in order to repurchase such
    securities, in whole or in part, we must establish to our
    regulators’ satisfaction that we have met all of the
    conditions to repurchase and must obtain the approval of the
    Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to repurchase the
    U.S. Treasury’s CPP investment in our Series B
    Preferred Stock subject to conditions that we find acceptable,
    or at all. In addition to limiting our ability to return capital
    to our shareholders, the U.S. Treasury’s investment
    could limit our ability to retain key executives and other key
    employees, and limit our ability to develop business
    opportunities. These factors could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our
    earnings on loans and other interest-earning assets.

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
    interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
    interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
    and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
    are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
    control, including general economic conditions, the competitive
    environment within our markets, consumer preferences for
    specific loan and deposit products and policies of various
    governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the
    Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes
    in interest rates, could influence not only the amount of
    interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
    interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
    could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
    deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
    liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
    borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
    receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
    and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
    could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
    loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest
    we pay on deposits and other borrowings. We use simulation
    analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based
    on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet changes,
    customer behavior, new products, new business volume, product
    pricing, competitor behavior, the behavior of market interest
    rates and anticipated hedging activities. Simulation analysis
    involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of
    future risks and trends. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those derived in
    simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency
    of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed,
    changes in balance sheet composition, and the possible effects
    of unanticipated or unknown events.

Although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and
    liability management strategies, including simulation analysis
    and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments,
    to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on
    our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in market interest rates could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to changes in the financial markets which could
    adversely affect us.

Traditionally, market factors such as changes in foreign
    exchange rates, changes in the equity markets and changes in the
    financial soundness of bond insurers, sureties and other
    unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect
    current market values of financial instruments. During 2008,
    market events demonstrated this to an extreme. Between July 2007
    and October 2009, conditions in the fixed income markets,
    specifically the wider credit spreads over benchmark
    U.S. Treasury securities for many fixed income securities,
    caused significant volatility in the market values of loans,
    securities, and certain other financial instruments that are
    held in our trading or

held-for-sale

portfolios. Opportunities to minimize the adverse affects of
    market changes are not always available. Substantial changes in
    the financial markets could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect
    us.

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be
    adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of
    other financial institutions. Financial services to institutions
    are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty
    or other relationships. We have exposure to many different
    industries and counterparties, and routinely execute
    transactions with counterparties in the financial industry,
    including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment
    banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients.
    During 2008, Key incurred $54 million of derivative-related
    charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure
    of Lehman Brothers. Another example of losses related to this
    type of risk are the losses associated with the Bernie Madoff
    ponzi scheme (“Madoff ponzi scheme”). As a result of
    the Madoff ponzi scheme, our investment subsidiary, Austin,
    determined that its funds had suffered investment losses up to
    $186 million. Following Lehman Brothers’ failure, we
    took several steps to better measure, monitor, and mitigate our
    counterparty risks and to reduce these exposures and implemented
    our Enterprise Risk Management Program to better monitor and
    evaluate risk presented enterprise-wide. These measures include
    daily position measurement and reporting, the use of scenario
    analysis and stress testing, replacement cost estimation, risk
    mitigation strategies, and market feedback validation.



Many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the
    event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our
    credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot
    be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to
    recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due
    us. It is not possible to anticipate all of these risks and it
    is not feasible to mitigate these risks completely. Accordingly,
    there is no assurance that our Enterprise Risk Management
    program will effectively mitigate these risks. Accordingly,
    these factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our
    funding levels.

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
    level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences. Although we have implemented
    strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding
    to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in
    assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions,
    any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us. Certain credit markets that we
    participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were
    significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of
    2007 through the third quarter of 2009. Credit markets have
    improved since then, and we have significantly reduced our
    reliance on wholesale funding sources. Part of our strategy to
    reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit
    growth, exiting certain noncore lending businesses, diversifying
    our funding base, maintaining a liquid asset portfolio, and
    strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a
    source of liquidity. Many of these disrupted markets are showing
    signs of recovery. Nonetheless, if further market disruption or
    other factors reduce the cost effectiveness

and/or

the
    availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged
    period of time, should our funding needs necessitate it, we may
    need to expand the utilization of unsecured wholesale funding
    instruments, or use other potential means of accessing funding
    and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits,
    securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of
    wholesale borrowings, purchasing deposits from other banks,
    borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities, and
    utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in
    a variety of markets — domestic, European and
    Canadian — as well as increased management of loan
    growth and investment opportunities and other management tools.
    There can be no assurance that these alternative means of
    funding will be available; under certain stressed conditions
    experienced in the liquidity crisis during

2007-2009,

some of these alternative means of funding were not available.
    Should these forms of funding become unavailable, it is unclear
    what impact, given current economic conditions, unavailability
    of such funding would have on us. A deep and prolonged
    disruption in the markets could have the effect of significantly
    restricting the accessibility of cost effective capital and
    funding, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Various
    factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to
    increase.

We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a
    reserve established through a provision for loan and lease
    losses charged to expense, that represents our estimate of
    losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance is
    necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and
    risks incurred in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance
    reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations,
    specific credit risks, loan and lease loss experience, current
    loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and
    regulatory conditions, and incurred losses inherent in the
    current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate
    level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently
    involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make
    significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends,
    all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic
    conditions affecting borrowers, the stagnation of certain
    economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as
    unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding
    existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and
    other factors, both within and outside of our control, may
    require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.
    In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our
    allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase
    in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of
    further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ
    somewhat from those of our own management. In addition, if
    charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and
    lease losses (i.e., if the loan and lease allowance is
    inadequate), we will need additional loan and lease loss
    provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses.
    Additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and
    lease losses, should they become necessary, would result in a
    decrease in net income and capital and may have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to operational risk.

We are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of
    loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal
    processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk
    also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of
    loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules,
    regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. We are
    also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing
    arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or
    capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability
    to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our
    business, such as certain loan processing functions.
    Additionally, some of our outsourcing arrangements are located
    overseas and therefore are subject to political risks unique to
    the regions in which they operate. Although we seek to mitigate
    operational risk through a



system of internal controls, resulting losses from operational
    risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased
    operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone
    opportunities, any and all of which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Our
    profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in
    the geographic regions in which we operate.

Our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the
    markets in which we operate. We have concentrations of loans and
    other business activities in geographic areas where our branches
    are located — the Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the
    Great Lakes and the Northeast — as well as potential
    exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint.
    For example, the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our
    commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets
    outside of our footprint. Real estate values and cash flows have
    been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak
    economic conditions. Certain markets, such as Florida, southern
    California, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada, have
    experienced more significant deterioration. The delinquencies,
    nonperforming loans and charge-offs that we have experienced
    since 2007 have been more heavily weighted to these specific
    markets. The regional economic conditions in areas in which we
    conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our
    products and services as well as the ability of our customers to
    repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the
    stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant decline
    in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession,
    an act of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other
    international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in
    securities markets or other factors, such as severe declines in
    the value of homes and other real estate, could also impact
    these regional economies and, in turn, have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry and market
    areas.

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
    from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
    larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
    primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
    smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
    operate. We also face competition from many other types of
    financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings
    associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance
    companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
    management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
    other local, regional and national financial services firms. In
    recent years, while the breadth of the institutions that we
    compete with has increased, competition has intensified as a
    result of consolidation efforts. During 2009, competition
    continued to intensify as the challenges of the liquidity crisis
    and market disruption led to further redistribution of deposits
    and certain banking assets to strong and large financial
    institutions. We expect this trend to continue. The competitive
    landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional
    investment banks to bank holding companies during the liquidity
    crisis due to the access it provides to government-sponsored
    sources of liquidity. The financial services industry’s
    competitive landscape could become even more intensified as a
    result of legislative, regulatory, structural and technological
    changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology has
    lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to
    offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
    factors, including, among other things:

•

our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and
    initiatives;

•

our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term
    customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical
    standards and safe, sound assets;

•

our ability to expand our market position;

•

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services
    offered to meet customer needs and demands;

•

the rate at which we introduce new products and services
    relative to our competitors;

•

our ability to attract and retain talented executives and
    relationship managers; and

•

industry and general economic trends.

Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
    weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
    our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to extensive government regulation and
    supervision.

We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and
    supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to
    protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds
    and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These
    regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure,
    investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other
    things. KeyCorp, as well as other financial institutions more
    generally, have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny
    from regulatory authorities stemming from broader systemic
    regulatory concerns, including with respect to stress testing,
    capital levels, asset quality, provisioning and other prudential
    matters, arising as a result of the recent financial crisis and
    efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to
    improve their risk management and prevent future crises.

Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review
    banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The
    passage of the Dodd-Frank Act has made it clear that a variety
    of significant changes to the banking and financial
    institutions’



regulatory regime will be implemented over the next few years.
    It is not possible to predict the scope of such changes or their
    potential impact on our financial position or results of
    operations.

These regulations or others designed to implement parts of
    comprehensive financial regulatory reform could limit our
    ability to conduct certain of our businesses, such as funds that
    are managed by our investment advisor subsidiary, Victory
    Capital Management Inc., or funds sponsored and advised by our
    principal investing line of business, which could require us to
    divest or spin-off certain of our business units and private
    equity investments. Furthermore, as part of the SCAP, Key was
    identified as a financial institution that was one of nineteen
    firms that collectively hold two-thirds of the banking assets
    and more than one-half of the loans in the U.S. banking
    system. While it is difficult to predict the extent or nature of
    regulatory reform, should regulatory reform limit the size of
    the SCAP banks, our ability to pursue opportunities to achieve
    growth through the acquisition of other banks or deposits could
    be affected, which, in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Us.

Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies; changes
    in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations
    or policies;

and/or

continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
    requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways, and could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the
    types of financial services and products that we may offer

and/or

increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial
    services and products, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with laws, regulations or policies
    (including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent
    such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
    agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us.

Our
    controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure
    controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and
    procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and
    operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the
    objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention
    of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with
    regulations related to controls and procedures could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We rely
    on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our
    funds.

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our
    subsidiaries. With the exception of cash raised from debt and
    equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our cash flow
    from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the
    principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity
    securities and interest and principal on our debt. Federal
    banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that
    KeyBank (our largest subsidiary) and certain nonbank
    subsidiaries may pay to us. During 2008 and 2009, KeyBank did
    not pay any dividends to us; nonbank subsidiaries paid us
    $25 million in dividends during 2010. During 2010, KeyBank
    could not pay dividends to KeyCorp because KeyBank’s net
    losses of $1.151 billion for 2009 and $1.161 billion
    for 2008 exceeded KeyBank’s net income during 2010. For
    further information on the regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends by KeyBank, see “Supervision and
    Regulation — Capital Actions, Dividend Restrictions
    and the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program” of this
    report.

Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon
    a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to
    the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the
    event KeyBank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be
    able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our
    equity securities. The inability to receive dividends from
    KeyBank could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Our
    earnings and/or financial condition may be affected by changes
    in accounting principles and in tax laws, or the interpretation
    of them.

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. Although these
    changes may not have an economic impact on our business, they
    could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain
    performance measures.

Like all businesses, we are subject to tax laws, rules and
    regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
    including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
    laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or
    other governmental bodies, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
    costs, among other things. Failure to appropriately comply with
    tax laws, rules and regulations could result in sanctions by
    regulatory agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us.

Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred
    tax assets. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon
    earnings forecasts and prior period earnings, among other
    things. A significant change in our assumptions could affect the
    carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet,
    which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.



Potential
    acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder
    value.

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
    risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
    other things:

•

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the
    target company;

•

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;

•

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and
    personnel of the target company;

•

potential disruption to our business;

•

potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;

•

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target
    company;

•

difficulty in estimating the value (i.e. the assets and
    liabilities) of the target company;

•

difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets,
    liabilities and derivatives of the target company; and

•

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may
    affect the target company.

We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
    conduct due diligence activities related to possible
    transactions with other financial institutions and financial
    services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
    discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
    future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
    securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve
    the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,
    therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
    income per Common Share may occur in connection with any future
    transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected
    revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or
    product presence,

and/or

other
    projected benefits from an acquisition could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We may
    not be able to attract and retain skilled people.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
    and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
    activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may
    not be able to retain or hire the people we want

and/or

need.
    In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must
    compensate such employees at market levels. Typically, those
    levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest
    expense. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain
    qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our
    competitive position, our performance, including our competitive
    position, could suffer, and, in turn, have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us. Although we have incentive compensation plans
    aimed, in part, at long-term employee retention, the unexpected
    loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still
    occur, and such events may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us
    because of the loss of the employee’s skills, knowledge of
    our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of
    promptly finding qualified replacement personnel for our
    talented executives

and/or

relationship managers.

Pursuant to the standardized terms of the CPP, among other
    things, we agreed to institute certain restrictions on the
    compensation of certain senior executive management positions
    that could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or
    retain the most qualified senior executives. Other restrictions
    were imposed under the Recovery Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and
    other legislation or regulations. Our ability to attract

and/or

retain talented executives

and/or

relationship managers may be affected by these developments or
    any new executive compensation limits, and such restrictions
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Our
    information systems may experience an interruption or breach in
    security.

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
    conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in
    security of these systems could result in failures or
    disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
    ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies
    and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
    possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
    information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
    failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if
    any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed. The
    occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of
    our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a
    loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory
    scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible
    financial liability, any of which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We
    continually encounter technological change.

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
    technological change with frequent introductions of new
    technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
    technology increases efficiency and enables financial
    institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our
    future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
    needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
    and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
    create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
    competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
    technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
    implement new technology-driven products and services or be
    successful in



marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure
    to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting
    the financial services industry could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to claims and litigation.

From time to time, customers

and/or

vendors may make claims and take legal actions against us. We
    maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate
    based upon our assessment of the claims. Whether any particular
    claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such
    claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may
    result in significant financial liability

and/or

adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products
    and services as well as impact customer demand for those
    products and services. We are also involved, from time to time,
    in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal
    and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies
    regarding our business, including, among other things,
    accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result
    in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions
    or other relief. The number of these investigations and
    proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many
    firms in the financial services industry. There have also been a
    number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct
    by employees in the financial services industry in recent years,
    and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is
    not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and
    the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may
    not be effective in all cases. Any financial liability for which
    we have not adequately maintained reserves,

and/or

any
    reputation damage from such claims and legal actions, could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Severe
    weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other
    external events could significantly impact our
    business.

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
    other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
    our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
    stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
    to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
    securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
    loss of revenue

and/or

cause
    us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established
    disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitor for
    significant environmental effects on our properties or our
    investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Risks
    Associated With Our Common Shares

Our
    issuance of securities to the U.S. Treasury may limit our
    ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to
    our Common Shares. If we are unable to redeem such preferred
    shares, the dividend rate will increase substantially after five
    years.

In connection with our sale of $2.5 billion of the
    Series B Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury in
    conjunction with its CPP, we also issued a Warrant to purchase
    35,244,361 of our Common Shares at an exercise price of $10.64.
    The number of shares was determined based upon the requirements
    of the CPP, and was calculated based on the average market price
    of our Common Shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval
    of our issuance (which was also the basis for the exercise price
    of $10.64). The terms of the transaction with the
    U.S. Treasury include limitations on our ability to pay
    dividends and repurchase our Common Shares. For three years
    after the issuance or until the U.S. Treasury no longer
    holds any Series B Preferred Stock, we will not be able to
    increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend
    declared during the third quarter 2008 ($0.1875 per common share
    on a quarterly basis) nor repurchase any of our Common Shares or
    preferred stock without, among other things, U.S. Treasury
    approval or the availability of certain limited exceptions
    (e.g., purchases in connection with our benefit plans).
    Furthermore, as long as the Series B Preferred Stock issued
    to the U.S. Treasury is outstanding, dividend payments and
    repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity
    securities, including our Common Shares, are prohibited until
    all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred
    stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. These
    restrictions, combined with the dilutive impact of the Warrant,
    may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common
    Shares, and, as a result, could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Us.

Unless we are able to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock
    during the first five years, the dividend payments on this
    capital will increase substantially at that point, from 5%
    ($125 million annually) to 9% ($225 million annually).
    Depending on market conditions at the time, this increase in
    dividends could significantly impact our liquidity and, as a
    result, have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

You may
    not receive dividends on the Common Shares.

Holders of our Common Shares are only entitled to receive such
    dividends as the Board of Directors may declare out of funds
    legally available for such payments. Furthermore, our common
    shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any
    holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing
    such preferred stock then outstanding. As of February 17,
    2011, there were 2,904,839 shares of KeyCorp’s
    Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of
    $100 per share issued and



outstanding and 25,000 shares of the Series B
    Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per
    share issued and outstanding.

In July 2009, we reduced the quarterly dividend on our Common
    Shares to $0.01 per share. As long as our Series A
    Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock are
    outstanding, dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions
    relating to certain equity securities, including our Common
    Shares, are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends
    are paid on such preferred stock, subject to certain limited
    exceptions. In addition, prior to November 14, 2011, unless
    we have redeemed all of the Series B Preferred Stock or the
    U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the Series B
    Preferred Stock to third parties, the consent of the
    U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other
    things, increase our Common Shares dividend above $.1875, except
    in limited circumstances should we redeem the
    U.S. Treasury’s investment, our ability to increase
    our dividend. These factors could adversely affect the market
    price of our Common Shares. Also, KeyCorp is a bank holding
    company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is
    dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations,
    including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding
    capital adequacy and dividends.

In addition, terms of KeyBank’s outstanding junior
    subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or
    paying any dividends or distributions on KeyCorp’s capital
    stock, including its Common Shares, or purchasing, acquiring, or
    making a liquidation payment on such stock, if an event of
    default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable
    indenture, if we are in default with respect to a guarantee
    payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or
    if we have given notice of our election to defer interest
    payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced
    or a deferral period is continuing. These factors could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

There may
    be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may
    adversely affect the market price of our Common
    Shares.

We are not restricted from issuing additional Common Shares,
    including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable
    for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Shares. As
    described above, in connection with our sale of
    $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock to the
    U.S. Treasury, we issued to the Department of the Treasury
    a Warrant to purchase 35,244,361 of our Common Shares at an
    exercise price of $10.64, subject to adjustment. Although we
    have the right to repurchase the Warrant at a negotiated price,
    we may not desire or be able to do so; and if we do not
    repurchase the Warrant, the U.S. Treasury could either
    exercise the Warrant or sell it to third parties. The issuance
    of additional Common Shares as a result of exercise of this
    Warrant or the issuance of convertible securities would dilute
    the ownership interest of existing holders of our Common Shares.
    In addition, we have in the past and may in the future issue
    options, convertible preferred stock,

and/or

other
    securities that may have a dilutive effect on our Common Shares.
    The market price of our Common Shares could decline as a result
    of any such offering, other capital raising strategies or other
    sales of a large block of shares of our Common Shares or similar
    securities in the market, or the perception that such sales
    could occur.

Our
    Common Shares are equity and are subordinate to our existing and
    future indebtedness and preferred stock and effectively
    subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non-common equity
    claims against our subsidiaries.

Our Common Shares are equity interests and do not constitute
    indebtedness. As such, our Common Shares will rank junior to all
    of our current and future indebtedness and to other non-equity
    claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims
    against us, including in the event of our liquidation.
    Additionally, holders of our Common Shares are subject to the
    prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our
    outstanding preferred stock. Our board of directors is
    authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred
    stock without any action on the part of the holders of our
    Common Shares. In addition, our right to participate in any
    distribution of assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the
    subsidiary’s liquidation or otherwise, and thus the ability
    of a holder of our Common Shares to benefit indirectly from such
    distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of creditors
    of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims
    as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result,
    our Common Shares will effectively be subordinated to all
    existing and future liabilities and obligations of our
    subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2010, we had
    $13.8 billion of borrowed funds and $60.6 billion of
    deposits; and the aggregate liquidation preference of our
    outstanding preferred stock was $2.7 billion.

Our share
    price can be volatile.

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
    resell your Common Shares when you want and at prices you find
    attractive. Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
    response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

•

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
    operations;

•

recommendation by securities analysts;

•

operating and stock price performance of other companies that
    investors deem comparable to our business;

•

changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets,
    including the market for mortgage-related securities;

•

news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
    the financial services industry;



•

perceptions of us

and/or

our
    competitors in the marketplace;

•

new technology used, or products or services offered, by
    competitors;

•

significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic
    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments entered into
    by us or our competitors;

•

failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated
    benefits from acquisitions;

•

future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;

•

our past and future dividend practices;

•

changes in governmental regulations affecting our industry
    generally or our business and operations;

•

changes in global financial markets, economies and market
    conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock,
    commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility;

•

geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or
    military conflicts; and

•

the occurrence or nonoccurrence, as appropriate, of any
    circumstance described in these Risk Factors.

General market fluctuations, market disruption, industry factors
    and general economic and political conditions and events, such
    as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or
    credit loss trends, could also cause our share price to decrease
    regardless of operating results. Any of these factors could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

An
    investment in our Common Shares is not an insured
    deposit.

Our Common Shares are not a bank deposit and, therefore, are not
    insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
    fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our
    Common Shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in
    this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
    report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
    price of common shares in any company. As a result, if you
    acquire our Common Shares, you may lose some or all of your
    investment.

Our
    articles of incorporation and regulations, as well as certain
    banking laws, may have an anti-takeover effect.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and
    federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
    requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial
    to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may
    inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination,
    which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our
    Common Shares.

Risks
    Associated With Our Industry

Maintaining
    or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to
    adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards
    and consumer preferences, while maintaining competitive prices
    for our products and services.

The continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies,
    including internet services, requires us to evaluate our product
    and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive. Our
    success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products
    and services to evolving industry standards and consumer
    preferences. There is increasing pressure from our competitors,
    both bank and non-bank, to keep pace with evolving preferences
    of consumers and businesses. Payment methods and financial
    service providers have evolved as the advancement of technology
    has made possible the delivery of financial products and
    services through different mediums and providers, such as cell
    phones and pay-pal accounts; thereby, increasing competitive
    pressure in the delivery of financial products and services. The
    adoption of new technologies could require us to make
    substantial expenditures to modify our existing products and
    services. Furthermore, we might not be successful in developing
    or introducing new products and services, adapting to changing
    consumer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving
    market acceptance or regulatory approval, or sufficiently
    developing or maintaining a loyal customer base. The
    introduction of new products and services has the potential to
    introduce risk which, in turn, can present challenges to us in
    operating within our risk tolerances while also achieving growth
    in our market share. In addition, there is increasing pressure
    from our competitors to deliver products and services at lower
    prices. These factors could reduce our revenues from our net
    interest margin and fee-based products and services and have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Certain
    industries, including the financial services industry, are more
    significantly affected by certain economic factors such as
    unemployment and real estate asset values. Should the
    improvement of these economic factors lag the improvement of the
    overall economy, or not occur, we could be adversely
    affected.

Should the stabilization of the U.S. economy lead to a
    general economic recovery, the improvement of certain economic
    factors, such as unemployment and real estate asset values and
    rents, may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall
    economy, or not occur at all. These economic factors typically
    affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial
    services, more significantly. For example, improvements in
    commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic
    recovery by twelve to eighteen months. Our clients include
    entities active in these industries. Furthermore, financial
    services companies with a substantial lending business, like
    ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make
    debt service payments on



loans. Should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to
    recover for an extended period of time, it could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Difficult
    market conditions have adversely affected the financial services
    industry, business and results of operations.

The dramatic deterioration experienced in the housing market
    since 2007 led to weakness across geographies, industries, and
    ultimately the broad economy. During this period, the housing
    market experienced falling home prices, increasing foreclosures;
    unemployment and under-employment rose significantly; and
    weakened commercial real estate fundamentals negatively impacted
    the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in
    significant write-downs of asset values by financial
    institutions, including government-sponsored entities, and
    commercial and investment banks. The resulting write-downs to
    assets of financial institutions caused many financial
    institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger
    and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to seek government
    assistance or bankruptcy protection. It is not possible to
    predict if these economic conditions will re-emerge, which of
    our markets, products or other businesses may ultimately be
    affected, and whether our actions and government remediation
    efforts may effectively mitigate these factors. If economic
    conditions deteriorate, it could result in an increase in loan
    delinquencies and nonperforming assets, decreases in loan
    collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and
    services, among other things, any of which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

If economic conditions deteriorate, we may face the following
    risks, including, but not limited to:

•

Increased regulation of our industry, including heightened legal
    standards and regulatory requirements or expectations.

•

Impairment of our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our
    customers if the models and approaches we use to select, manage,
    and underwrite customers become less predictive of future
    behaviors due to fundamental changes in economic conditions.

•

The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit
    exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments,
    including forecasts of economic conditions and how these
    economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers
    to repay their loans. In a highly uncertain economic
    environment, these processes may no longer be capable of
    accurate estimation and, in turn, may impact the reliability of
    our evaluation of our credit risk and exposure.

•

Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to
    engage in securitization funding transactions on favorable terms
    or at all could be adversely affected by future disruptions in
    the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating
    agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.

•

We may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in
    the future because market developments significantly deplete the
    insurance fund of the FDIC and reduce the ratio of reserves to
    insured deposits.

•

Financial institutions may be required, regardless of risk, to
    pay taxes or other fees to the U.S. Treasury. Such taxes or
    other fees could be designed to reimburse the U.S. Treasury
    for the many government programs and initiatives it may
    undertake as part of its economic stimulus efforts.

Financial
    services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of
    information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
    transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
    behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
    statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
    may also rely on representations of those customers,
    counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
    auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
    information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
    statements, credit reports or other financial information could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Consumers
    may decide not to use banks to complete their financial
    transactions.

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
    through alternative methods financial transactions that
    historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
    maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would
    have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also
    complete transactions such as paying bills

and/or

transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The
    process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
    “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
    income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
    income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
    streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank,
    may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt of
    KeyCorp or KeyBank, and capital securities or preferred stock of
    KeyCorp through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions
    or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, depend on prevailing
    market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements,
    contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved
    may be material.

At this time, we do not have an active repurchase program for
    our Common Shares other than for repurchases in connection with
    administration of our benefit programs. However, should we
    redeem the U.S. Treasury’s investment in our
    Series B Preferred Securities, we may choose, in lieu of
    repurchasing the Warrant from the U.S. Treasury to
    repurchase, retire or exchange an amount of our Common Shares to
    offset the estimated dilution, subject to the approval of the
    Federal Reserve. Such transactions, if any, depend on prevailing
    market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, and
    other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Throughout
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations, we use certain acronyms and
    abbreviations. These terms are defined in Note 1 (Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies) which begins on
    page 99.



Introduction

This section generally reviews the financial condition and
    results of operations of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries for each
    of the past three years. Some tables may include additional
    periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate
    trends in greater detail. When you read this discussion, you
    should also consult the consolidated financial statements and
    related notes in this report. The page locations of specific
    sections that we refer to are presented in the preceding table
    of contents.

Terminology

Throughout this discussion, references to “Key,”
    “we,” “our,” “us” and similar
    terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and
    its subsidiaries. “KeyCorp” refers solely to the
    parent holding company, and “KeyBank” refers to
    KeyCorp’s subsidiary bank, KeyBank National Association.

We want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so
    you can better understand the discussion that follows.

♦

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education
    lending business. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the
    operations of Austin Capital Management, Ltd., a subsidiary that
    specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional
    customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for
    these businesses as

discontinued operations

. We
    use the phrase

continuing operations

in this
    document to mean all of our businesses other than the education
    lending business and Austin.

♦

Our

exit loan portfolios

are separate from our

discontinued operations.

These portfolios, which
    are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to
    cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy.
    These exit loan portfolios are included in

Other
    Segments.

♦

We engage in

capital markets activities

primarily
    through business conducted by our Key Corporate Bank segment.
    These activities encompass a variety of products and services.
    Among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into
    derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients’
    financing needs and for proprietary trading purposes), and
    conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate
    clients’ needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange
    rates).

♦

For regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes.
    Federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half
    of a bank or bank holding company’s

total risk-based
    capital

must qualify as

Tier 1
    capital

. Both total and Tier 1 capital serve as
    bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an
    important indicator of financial stability and condition. As
    described in the section entitled “Economic Overview,”
    in 2010, the regulators initiated an additional level of review
    of capital adequacy for the country’s nineteen largest
    banking institutions, including KeyCorp. This regulatory
    assessment continued during 2010 and 2011. As part of this
    capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluated a
    component of Tier 1 capital, known as

Tier 1 common
    equity

. For a detailed explanation of total capital,
    Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity, and how they
    are calculated see the section entitled “Capital.”

♦

During the first quarter of 2010, we re-aligned our reporting
    structure for our segments. Previously, the Consumer Finance
    business group consisted mainly of portfolios that were
    identified as exit or run-off portfolios and were included in
    our Key Corporate Bank segment. We are now reflecting these exit
    portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan
    business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been
    re-aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within
    the Key Community Bank segment. In addition, other previously
    identified exit portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank
    segment, including our homebuilder loans from the Real Estate
    Capital line of business and commercial leases from the
    Equipment Finance line of business, have been moved to Other
    Segments. For more detailed financial information pertaining to
    each segment and its respective lines of business, see
    Note 21 (“Line of Business Results”).

Long-term
    financial goals

Our long-term financial goals are as follows:

♦

Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.

♦

Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off
    ratio range of .40% to .50%.

♦

Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net
    interest margin in excess of 3.50% and noninterest income to
    total revenue of greater than 40%.

♦

Create positive operating leverage and complete Keyvolution
    run-rate savings goal of $300 million to $375 million
    by the end of 2012.

♦

Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to
    1.25%.

Corporate
    strategy

We remain committed to enhancing shareholder value by having a
    strong balance sheet, consistent earnings growth, and a focus on
    risk-adjusted returns. We are achieving these goals by
    implementing our client insight-driven relationship strategy,
    which is built on enduring relationships, client-focused
    solutions with extraordinary client service, and a robust risk
    management culture. Our 2010/2011 strategic priorities for
    enhancing shareholder value and for creating sustainable
    long-term value were as follows:

♦

Drive sustainable, profitable growth through disciplined
    execution.

We strive for continuous improvement in
    our business. We continue to focus on increasing revenues,
    controlling costs, and returning to a moderate risk profile in
    our loan portfolios. Further, we will continue to leverage
    technology and other workforce initiatives to achieve these
    objectives.

♦

Expand, retain and acquire client
    relationships.

We work to deepen relationships with
    existing clients and to build targeted relationships with new
    clients, particularly those that have the potential to purchase
    multiple products and services or to generate repeat business.
    We aim to better understand our clients and to devise better
    ways to meet their needs by regularly seeking client feedback
    and using those insights to improve our products and services.
    We will strengthen the alignment between our Key Corporate Bank
    and Key Community Bank to ensure we deliver the whole array of
    products and services to our clients. Our relationship strategy
    and commitment to extraordinary service serve as the foundation
    for everything we do.

♦

Operate within a robust risk-management
    culture.

We will continue to align our risk
    tolerances with our corporate strategies and goals, and increase
    risk awareness throughout the company. Our employees must have a
    clear understanding of our risk tolerance with regard to factors
    such as asset quality, operational risk and liquidity levels to
    ensure that we operate within our desired risk appetite.

♦

Sustain strong reserves, capital and
    liquidity.

We intend to stay focused on sustaining
    strong reserves and capital, which we believe is important not
    only in today’s environment, but also to support future
    growth opportunities. We also remain committed to maintaining
    strong liquidity and funding positions.

♦

Attract and retain a capable, diverse and engaged
    workforce.

We are committed to investing in our
    workforce to optimize the talent in our organization. We will
    continue to stress the importance of training, retaining,
    developing and challenging our employees. We believe this is
    essential to succeeding on all of our priorities.



Strategic
    developments

We initiated the following actions during 2010 and 2009 to
    support our corporate strategy:

♦

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced that Henry L.
    Meyer will retire on May 1, 2011, and that Beth E. Mooney
    was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of KeyCorp and
    a member of KeyCorp’s Board of Directors. Mooney will
    assume the additional role of Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer on May 1, 2011, and become the first woman CEO of a
    top 20 U.S. bank. Mooney, who has over 30 years of
    experience in retail banking, commercial lending, and real
    estate financing, was previously Vice Chair of KeyCorp and head
    of Key’s Community Bank business.

♦

Three consecutive profitable quarters in 2010 and profit for the
    entire year. This positive trend was due to higher pre-provision
    net revenue and a lower provision for loan and lease losses. The
    growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher
    net interest margin and net interest income, well-controlled
    expenses and improvements in several fee-based businesses.

♦

We scored significantly higher than our four largest banking
    competitors in a third quarter of 2010 customer satisfaction
    survey conducted by the American Customer Satisfaction Index.
    Our scores were significantly better than bank industry scores
    across the multiple dimensions, most notably in Customer Loyalty.

♦

Our asset quality metrics significantly improved across the
    majority of our loan portfolios as we proactively addressed
    credit quality issues. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming
    loans decreased. Additionally, net loan charge-offs declined
    compared to the prior year.

♦

Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity
    and reserve levels. In August 2010, we issued $750 million
    of

5-year

senior unsecured debt at the holding company.

♦

During 2010 and 2009, we opened 77 new branches and renovated
    approximately 145 others. We expect to open

35-40

new
    branches in 2011 as part of our long-term plan to modernize and
    strengthen our presence in select markets.

♦

During 2009, we settled all outstanding federal income tax
    issues with the IRS for the tax years

1997-2006,

including all outstanding leveraged lease tax issues for all
    open tax years.

♦

During the third quarter of 2009, we decided to exit the
    government-guaranteed education lending business, following
    earlier actions taken in the third quarter of 2008 to cease
    private student lending. As a result of this decision, we have
    accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued
    operation. Additionally, we ceased conducting business in both
    the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets.

♦

During the second quarter of 2009, we decided to wind down the
    operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing
    hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result
    of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a
    discontinued operation.

♦

In late 2008, we began a corporate-wide initiative designed to
    build a consistently superior experience for our clients,
    simplify processes, improve speed to market, and enhance our
    ability to seize growth and profit opportunities. As of
    December 31, 2010, we have achieved $228 million of
    the targeted run-rate savings toward our goal of achieving
    $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Over
    the past three years, we have been exiting certain noncore
    businesses, such as retail marine and education lending, and
    have been modernizing our 14-state branch network, coupled with
    enhancing our online banking to provide clients with a breadth
    of options that meet their specific banking needs. As a result
    of these and other efforts, over the last two years, our
    workforce has been reduced by 2,485 average full-time equivalent
    employees.

Economic
    overview

The strength of the economic recovery in the United States
    varied throughout 2010; however, the year ended with a positive
    tone. During the first quarter, Gross Domestic Product
    (“GDP”) increased 3.7%, the second biggest quarterly
    increase since the recession began in December of 2007. GDP
    growth continued into the second and third quarters, although at
    a lower level. The average quarterly GDP growth of 2.7% for the
    first three quarters of 2010 represents a significant
    improvement from the 2009 average quarterly change in GDP of
    .25% and also outpaces the ten-year average of 1.7%. Growth in
    2010 was supported by businesses rebuilding inventory levels and
    capital spending on equipment and software. Growth was also
    sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending,
    which grew at an average monthly rate of .3% for 2010, matching
    the rate of growth in 2009.

Despite the strength in consumer spending, employers remained
    reluctant to add a significant number of employees to payrolls.
    U.S. payrolls increased by .9 million during 2010,
    compared to a decline of 5.1 million in 2009. 2010 was the
    first year of job growth since the recession began. Over
    8 million Americans lost their jobs during the recession.
    The unemployment rate declined to 9.4% in December of 2010,
    compared to 9.9% in December of 2009.



Housing continued to be a drag on consumer wealth in 2010 as
    home buying activity declined after the expiration of the
    homebuyer tax credit, offered as part of the The Worker,
    Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009. Historically
    low mortgage rates were not enough to attract buyers. Sales of
    existing homes declined by 3% in 2010 compared to a 15% rise in
    2009. The median price of existing homes in December 2010
    declined 1% from December 2009, compared to a 3% annual decline
    a year earlier. A reduced level of foreclosures helped to
    stabilize existing home prices. The number of foreclosures in
    December 2010 declined 26% from the December 2009 level. New
    home sales declined by 8% in 2010, compared to a 6% decline in
    2009. The median price of new homes increased by 8%. New home
    construction in December 2010 declined 8% from the same month in
    2009.

Due to an improved economic outlook and functioning of the
    financial markets, the Federal Reserve ceased its purchases of
    agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and closed
    most of its emergency liquidity facilities during the first
    quarter of 2010. As the economic outlook moderated during the
    second and third quarters, the Federal Reserve decided at the
    November Federal Open Market Committee meeting to reinstate
    quantitative easing through additional agency security
    purchases. The Federal Reserve also held the federal funds
    target rate near zero throughout all of 2010. Benchmark term
    interest rates declined during 2010 due to these Federal Reserve
    actions and expectations of a slow economic recovery. During
    2010, investors sought the safety of Treasury securities at
    times of heightened fears related to the European sovereign debt
    crisis. As a result of these factors, the benchmark two-year
    Treasury yield decreased to .60% at December 31, 2010, from
    1.14% at December 31, 2009, and the ten-year Treasury yield
    decreased to 3.30% at December 31, 2010 from 3.84% at
    December 31, 2009.

Regulatory
    Reform Developments

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act
    into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies
    and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in
    the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better
    equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate
    any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through
    increased supervision of systemically important financial
    companies (including nonbank financial companies). The
    Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes
    across the financial landscape affecting financial companies,
    including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a
    review of the various changes that the Dodd-Frank Act
    implements, see the “Supervision and Regulation —
    Regulatory Reform” in Item 1. Business of this report.
    Many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory
    agencies are still in the process of being developed

and/or

implemented.

Interchange
    Fees

On December 16, 2010, the Federal Reserve released proposed
    rules governing interchange fees that merchants pay to banks
    when consumers make purchases with their debit cards (the
    “proposal”). The proposal would implement provisions
    of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposal was open for public comment
    through February 22, 2011, with the Federal Reserve
    expecting implementation of any proposed interchange fee
    standards by July 21, 2011, should the proposal be adopted.

As previously announced, we currently estimate that
    approximately $100 million in debit interchange revenue
    could be impacted by the proposal. Until the regulations are
    finalized by the Federal Reserve, it is premature to assess the
    impact on this combined revenue stream of the proposal. It is
    possible that the effect could be significant to the revenue we
    derive from these activities.

Regulation E
    pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of

During the third quarter of 2010, the Federal Reserve’s
    final rules regarding Regulation E became effective.
    Regulation E is designed to protect consumers by
    prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to
    consumers. Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010,
    for new clients and on August 15, 2010, for existing
    clients. Regulation E, among other items, prohibits
    financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client
    without receiving consent from the client to “opt-in”
    to the financial institutions overdraft services for ATM and
    everyday debit card transactions.

Based on the number of clients whom have opted-in, we estimate
    the impact to us was an annualized decline of approximately
    $40 million in our deposit service charge income during the
    fourth quarter of 2010. This decline is consistent with our
    previously reported expectations. However, this amount is
    subject to change as additional clients make their overdraft
    decisions.

FDIC
    Rulemaking Developments

Several significant developments have impacted Deposit Insurance
    Assessments. Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic
    deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The
    FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for
    deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance
    assessment base times a risk-based assessment rate. Under the
    risk-based assessment system in effect during 2010, annualized
    deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775
    for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the
    institution’s risk category. This system will remain in
    effect for the first quarter of 2011. In 2009, the FDIC amended
    its assessment regulations to require insured depository
    institutions to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their
    estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009,
    and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012.



The amount of KeyBank’s assessment prepayment was
    $539 million. For 2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was
    $124 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had
    $388 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessment recorded
    on our balance sheet.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to change the assessment
    base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets
    minus average tangible equity, and requires the DIF reserve
    ratio to increase to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, rather
    than 1.15% by December 31, 2016, as previously required. To
    implement these and other changes to the current deposit
    insurance assessment regime, the FDIC issued several proposed
    rules in 2010. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted their
    final rule on assessments. Under the final rule, which is
    effective on April 1, 2011, KeyBank’s annualized
    deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to
    $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its
    new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBank’s
    regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding
    related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to
    the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate
    that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be
    $60 to $90 million.

Demographics

We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key
    Corporate Bank. The effect on our business of continued
    volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the
    state of the economy in the regions in which these business
    segments operate.

Key Community Bank serves consumers and small to mid-sized
    businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending
    and wealth management products and services. These products and
    services are provided through a 14-state branch network
    organized into three internally defined geographic regions:
    Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.

Commercial and industrial loan growth in our middle-market
    portfolio is improving. We are particularly encouraged as we
    experienced commercial loan growth during the fourth quarter of
    2010 in the Northeast region. Trends are improving in the Great
    Lakes, Rocky Mountains and Northwest regions as the economic
    recovery migrates across the country. Merger and acquisition
    activity is also increasing and we expect businesses to begin to
    draw on their available credit facilities and cash to make
    investments in their production capabilities that have been
    postponed over the past several years.

    Bank segment’s average core deposits, commercial loans and

Represents average deposits,
    commercial loan and home equity loan products centrally managed
    outside of our three Key Community Bank regions.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate
    nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network, as
    well as internationally.

The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business
    consists of two business units. Real Estate Capital provides
    lending, debt placements, servicing, and equity and investment
    banking services to developers, brokers and owner investors
    dealing primarily with nonowner-occupied properties. Corporate
    Banking provides a full array of commercial banking products and
    cash management services.

Equipment Finance meets the equipment leasing needs of companies
    worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and
    resellers with funding options for their clients.

The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two
    business units. KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial
    lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives,
    foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and



syndicated finance products and services to large corporations
    and middle-market companies. Victory Capital Management manages
    or offers advice regarding investment portfolios for a national
    client base.

Additional information regarding the products and services
    offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank
    segments are described further in this report in Note 21
    (“Line of Business”).

Since the beginning of the financial crisis, results for Key
    Corporate Bank have been adversely affected by increasing credit
    costs and volatility in the capital markets. In 2010, credit
    losses in the Key Corporate Bank declined and the overall
    recovery in the equity markets led to growth in the market
    values of assets under management, and stability in the market
    value of other assets (primarily commercial real estate loans
    and securities held for sale or trading).

We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of 2010.
    We used this as an opportunity to continue to sell certain of
    our nonperforming assets. We were encouraged by the fact that we
    were able to sell these assets at prices that were close to
    their carrying value as recorded on our books.

Figure 22, which appears later in this report in the “Loans
    and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of
    our commercial real estate lending business based on industry
    type and location. As previously reported, we have ceased all
    new lending to homebuilders and, since December 31, 2007,
    we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential
    properties portion of the commercial real estate construction
    loan portfolio by $3 billion, or 85%, to $525 million.
    Additional information about loan sales is included in the
    “Credit risk management” section.

Critical
    accounting policies and estimates

Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must
    exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies
    and methodologies. These choices are critical; not only are they
    necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the
    appropriate way to record and report our overall financial
    performance. All accounting policies are important, and all
    policies described in Note 1 should be reviewed for a
    greater understanding of how we record and report our financial
    performance.

In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than
    others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to
    expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These
    policies apply to areas of relatively greater business
    importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make
    assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the
    financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates
    are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be
    inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.

We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and
    estimates to make a number of core decisions. A brief discussion
    of each of these areas follows.

Allowance
    for loan and lease losses

The loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our
    balance sheet. We consider a variety of data to determine
    probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish
    an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses. For
    example, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with
    similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the
    impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions,
    lending policies, underwriting standards, and the level of
    credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.
    Other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated
    collateral values.

For all TDR’s, regardless of size, as well as all other
    impaired loans with an outstanding balance greater than
    $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the
    probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if
    deemed appropriate. For example, a specific allowance may be
    assigned — even when sources of repayment appear
    sufficient — if we remain uncertain that the loan will
    be repaid in full.

We continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and
    adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate.
    The economic and business climate in any given industry or
    market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly, and the
    effects of those changes can vary by borrower. However, since
    our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects,
    and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio
    may be improving while the risk profile of others is
    deteriorating, we may decide to change the level of the
    allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it
    for any other segment.

At December 31, 2010, the Key Community Bank reporting unit
    had $917 million in goodwill, while the Key Corporate Bank
    reporting unit had no recorded goodwill. In addition to
    adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect
    market conditions, we also may adjust the allowance because of
    unique events that cause actual losses to vary abruptly and
    significantly from expected losses. For example, class action
    lawsuits brought against an industry segment (e.g., one that
    used asbestos in its product) can cause a precipitous
    deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in
    that segment. Conversely, the dismissal of such lawsuits can
    improve the risk profile. In either case, historical loss rates
    for that industry segment would not have provided a precise
    basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance.



Even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can
    significantly affect management’s determination of the
    appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be
    applied across a large portfolio. To illustrate, an increase in
    estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our
    consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2010, would
    indicate the need for a $16 million increase in the level
    of the allowance. The same level of increase in estimated losses
    for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a
    $35 million increase in the allowance. Such adjustments to
    the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect
    financial results. Following the above examples, a
    $16 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio
    allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis
    by approximately $10 million, or $.01 per share; a
    $35 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio
    allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by
    approximately $22 million, or $.02 per share.

As we make decisions regarding the allowance, we benefit from a
    lengthy organizational history and experience with credit
    evaluations and related outcomes. Nonetheless, if our underlying
    assumptions later prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan
    and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted, possibly
    having an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in
    Note 1 under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease
    Losses.”

Valuation
    methodologies

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the applicable
    accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures,
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. In the absence of quoted market prices, we
    determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using
    internally developed models, which are based on third-party data
    as well as our judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding
    credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant
    market available inputs. We describe our adoption of this
    accounting guidance, the process used to determine fair values
    and the fair value hierarchy in Note 1 under the heading
    “Fair Value Measurements” and in Note 6
    (“Fair Value Measurements”).

At December 31, 2010, $25.3 billion, or 28%, of our
    total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Substantially all of these assets were classified as
    Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At
    December 31, 2010, $2.2 billion, or 3%, of our total
    liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
    Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as
    Level 1 or Level 2.

At December 31, 2010, $296 million, or 0.3%, of our
    total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis. Approximately 13% of these assets were classified as
    Level 1 or Level 2. At December 31, 2010, there
    were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis.

Valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment,
    particularly when there are no observable active markets for the
    items being valued. To determine the values of assets and
    liabilities, as well as the extent to which related assets may
    be impaired, we make assumptions and estimates related to
    discount rates, asset returns, prepayment rates and other
    factors. The use of different discount rates or other valuation
    assumptions could produce significantly different results. The
    outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on
    the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities, including loans
    held for sale, principal investments, goodwill, and pension and
    other postretirement benefit obligations.

A discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans
    held for sale is included in Note 1 under the heading
    “Loans Held for Sale.”

Our principal investments include direct and indirect
    investments, predominantly in privately-held companies. The fair
    values of these investments are determined by considering a
    number of factors, including the target company’s financial
    condition and results of operations, values of public companies
    in comparable businesses, market liquidity, and the nature and
    duration of resale restrictions. The fair value of principal
    investments was $898 million at December 31, 2010; a
    10% positive or negative variance in that fair value would have
    increased or decreased our 2010 earnings by approximately
    $90 million ($56 million after tax, or $.06 per share).

The valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of
    goodwill impairment are summarized in Note 1 under the
    heading “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The
    first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair
    value of each reporting unit. Our reporting units for purposes
    of this testing are our two major business segments: Key
    Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Fair values are estimated
    using comparable external market data (market approach) and
    discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate
    risk premium and earnings forecast information (income
    approach). We perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated
    fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate. We believe the
    estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment
    analysis for our reporting units are reasonable. However, if
    actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions
    or estimates used, the fair value of each reporting unit could
    change in the future.

The second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the
    carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    suggesting goodwill impairment. In such a case, we would
    estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit



(representing the unit’s fair value) and then compare that
    hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the
    unit’s net assets (excluding goodwill). Any excess of the
    estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting
    unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of
    goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to
    earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

As a result of our sale of Tuition Management Systems in
    December 2010, customer relationship intangible assets of
    $15 million were written off against the purchase price to
    determine the net gain during 2010. During 2009, we recorded
    noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of
    $241 million ($192 million after tax, or $.28 per
    common share). See Note 10 (“Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”) for a summary of the events that
    resulted in these charges.

Due to the economic uncertainty experienced since 2007, we have
    conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill
    impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our
    goodwill, as necessary.

The primary assumptions used in determining our pension and
    other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses,
    including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions, are
    presented in Note 19 (“Employee Benefits”).

When potential asset impairment is identified, we must exercise
    judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment
    (i.e., temporary or

other-than-temporary)

to apply the appropriate accounting treatment. For example,
    unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are
    deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders’ equity;
    those deemed

“other-than-temporary”

are recorded in either earnings or shareholders’ equity
    based on certain factors. Additional information regarding
    temporary and

other-than-temporary

impairment on securities available for sale at December 31,
    2010, is provided in Note 7 (“Securities”).

Derivatives
    and hedging

We use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk
    for asset and liability management purposes. These derivative
    instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of
    specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Our
    accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current
    accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should
    be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance
    sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of
    master netting agreements. Accounting for changes in the fair
    value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends
    on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as
    part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of
    hedging relationship.

The application of hedge accounting requires significant
    judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well
    as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item
    groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged
    items. We believe our methods of addressing these judgments and
    applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the
    guidance and industry practices. However, interpretations of the
    applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve. In
    the future, these evolving interpretations could result in
    material changes to our accounting for derivative financial
    instruments and related hedging activities. Although such
    changes may not have a material effect on our financial
    condition, a change could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations in the period in which it occurs.
    Additional information relating to our use of derivatives is
    included in Note 1 under the heading
    “Derivatives” and Note 8 (“Derivatives and
    Hedging Activities”).

Contingent
    liabilities, guarantees and income taxes

Contingent liabilities arising from litigation and from
    guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which
    we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on
    the results of our operations, are summarized in Note 16
    (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and
    Guarantees”). We record a liability for the fair value of
    the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a
    guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments
    in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed
    the recorded amount. See Note 16 for a comparison of the
    liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future
    payments for the various types of guarantees that we had
    outstanding at December 31, 2010.

It is not always clear how the Internal Revenue Code and various
    state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. In the
    normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then
    have those benefits contested by the IRS or state tax
    authorities. We have provided tax reserves that we believe are
    adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges
    may necessitate. However, if our judgment later proves to be
    inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which
    could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and
    capital.

Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine
    the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not
    to be realized, and therefore recorded. The available evidence
    used in connection with these assessments includes taxable
    income in prior periods, projected future taxable income,
    potential tax-planning strategies and projected future reversals
    of deferred tax items. These assessments are subjective and may
    change. Based on these criteria, and in particular our
    projections for future taxable income, we currently believe that
    it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred
    tax asset in future periods. However, changes to the evidence
    used in our assessments could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of



operations in the period in which they occur. For further
    information on our accounting for income taxes, see Note 12
    (“Income Taxes”).

During 2010, we did not significantly alter the manner in which
    we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related
    assumptions and estimates.

Highlights
    of Our 2010 Performance

Financial
    performance

For 2010, we announced net income from continuing operations
    attributable to Key common shareholders of $390 million, or
    $.47 per Common Share. These results compare to a net loss from
    continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of
    $1.629 billion, or $2.27 per Common Share, for 2009.

Figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results
    for the past three years. Our financial performance for each of
    the past six years is summarized in Figure 4.

(a)

In September 2009, we decided to
    discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key
    Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of
    KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations
    of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund
    investments for institutional customers. As a result of these
    decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as
    discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations
    in 2010 was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments
    related to the education lending securitization trusts. Included
    in the loss from discontinued operations in 2009 is a charge for
    intangible assets impairment related to Austin.

The earnings improvement in 2010 resulted from improved
    pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan and
    lease losses when compared to 2009. Results in 2009 were
    adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease
    losses, write-offs of certain intangible assets and write-downs
    of certain commercial real estate related investments.

With three consecutive profitable quarters, and continued signs
    of increased economic activity on the part of our clients, we
    believe that we are positioned well to compete with other
    businesses in 2011. Our core financial measures –
    strong capital, enhanced liquidity, adequate loan and lease loss
    reserves, as well as our exit from riskier lending
    categories – represent a firm foundation for the year
    ahead.

Net interest margin from continuing operations was 3.26% for
    2010. This was an increase of 43 basis points from 2009.
    This increase was primarily due to lower funding costs, which
    began in the latter part of 2009. We continue to experience an
    improvement in our mix of deposits by reducing the level of
    higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing
    transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin
    was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets
    compared to the same period one year ago resulting from pay
    downs on loans. During 2009, our net interest margin was under
    pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels
    throughout the year. This resulted in a larger decrease in
    interest rates on earning assets than that experienced on
    interest-bearing liabilities.



We saw an increase in loan demand within our core commercial
    client base during the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the
    impact of our exit portfolios, our commercial and industrial and
    leasing portfolios both experienced loan growth for the first
    time since the fall of 2008. However, there can be no assurance
    this will continue in 2011, as many clients have sufficient
    liquidity resources to meet current operating needs.

In 2010, credit quality also continued to improve across the
    majority of the loan portfolios in both Key Community Bank and
    Key Corporate Bank. Net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loans
    declined each quarter during 2010. At December 31, 2010,
    nonperforming assets stood at their lowest level since the third
    quarter of 2008.

Net charge-offs for 2010 were $1.6 billion, a decrease of
    $687 million from 2009. During the same period, commercial
    loan net charge-offs decreased by $673 million, primarily
    driven by lower charge-offs from the commercial real estate
    construction portfolio.

At December 31, 2010, our nonperforming loans totaled
    $1.1 billion and represented 2.13% of period-end portfolio
    loans, compared to 3.72% at December 31, 2009.
    Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 totaled
    $1.3 billion and represented 2.66% of portfolio loans, OREO
    and other nonperforming assets, compared to $2.5 billion
    and 4.25% at December 31, 2009. Most of the reduction came
    from nonperforming loans in the commercial, financial and
    agricultural, the real estate – commercial mortgage,
    and the real estate – construction portfolios.

Our exit loan portfolio accounted for $210 million, or
    15.70%, of total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010,
    compared to $599 million, or 23.86%, at December 31,
    2009.

Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to
    $1.6 billion from $2.6 billion one year ago. At
    December 31, 2010, our allowance represented 3.20% of total
    loans and 150.19% of nonperforming loans compared to 4.31% and
    115.87%, respectively at December 31, 2009. One of our
    primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the
    higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio. In
    addition, we are continuing to work down the loan portfolios
    that have been identified for exit to improve our risk-adjusted
    returns. Further information pertaining to our progress in
    reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan
    portfolio is presented in the section entitled “Credit risk
    management.”

At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 common equity and
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were 9.34% and 15.16%,
    compared to 7.50% and 12.75%, respectively at December 31,
    2009. In 2009, we completed a series of successful transactions
    that generated approximately $2.4 billion of new
    Tier I common equity to strengthen our overall capital.

Additionally, we made significant progress on strengthening our
    liquidity and funding positions during 2010 while in the midst
    of weak loan demand and a soft economy. Our consolidated average
    loan to deposit ratio was 90% for the fourth quarter of 2010,
    compared to 97% for the fourth quarter of 2009. This improvement
    was accomplished by growing our noninterest-bearing deposits,
    NOW and money market deposits, reducing our reliance on
    wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and
    increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly
    liquid securities. During 2010, we originated approximately
    $29.5 billion in new or renewed lending commitments.

Over the last two years, we have opened 77 new branches and
    renovated approximately 145 others, expanding Key’s
    14-state branch network to 1,033 branches. Further, we plan to
    build an additional

35-40

new
    branches in 2011. We also recently announced that we scored
    significantly higher than our four largest competitor banks in a
    third quarter of 2010 customer satisfaction survey conducted by
    the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Our scores were
    significantly better than bank industry scores across multiple
    dimensions, most notably in Customer Loyalty.

Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to
    “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common
    equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus
    for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors
    in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects
    of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the
    banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company
    capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of
    capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal
    banking regulations. Since the commencement of the SCAP in early
    2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital
    adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known
    as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has
    long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity
    (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred
    stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling
    interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant
    element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on
    Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital
    adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common
    equity is also present in the Basel Committee’s
    Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are
    expected to adopt pursuant to regulations expected to be issued
    in the summer of 2011. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also
    changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank
    holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules
    phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative
    preferred securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued
    to the United States or any federal government entity before
    October 4, 2010) being treated as Tier 1 eligible
    capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences
    January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital
    securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.

Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP
    nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this
    measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since
    analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy
    using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we
    believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital
    adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP
    performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net
    revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management
    believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan
    and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by
    presenting them on a more comparable basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not
    required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although
    these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by
    investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as
    analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or
    as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

Line
    of Business Results

This section summarizes the financial performance and related
    strategic developments of our two major business segments
    (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.
    During the first quarter of 2010, we re-aligned our reporting
    structure for our business segments. Prior to 2010, Consumer
    Finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as
    exit or run-off portfolios and were included in our Key
    Corporate Bank segment. Effective for all periods presented, we
    are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other
    Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously
    included in Consumer Finance, has been re-aligned with the
    Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community
    Bank segment. In addition, other previously identified exit
    portfolios included in the Key Corporate Bank segment have been
    moved to Other Segments. Note 21 (“Line of Business
    Results”) describes the products and services offered by
    each of these business segments, provides more detailed
    financial information pertaining to the segments and their
    respective lines of business, and explains “Other
    Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”

Figure 6 summarizes the contribution made by each major business
    segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing
    operations” and “income (loss) from continuing
    operations attributable to Key” for each of the past three
    years.

Reconciling Items for 2009 include
    a $106 million credit to income taxes, due primarily to the
    settlement of IRS audits for the tax years

1997-2006.

Results for 2009 also include a $32 million
    ($20 million after tax) gain from the sale of our claim
    associated with the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and a
    $105 million ($65 million after tax) gain from the
    sale of our remaining equity interest in Visa Inc. Reconciling
    Items for 2008 include $120 million of previously accrued
    interest recovered in connection with our opt-in to the IRS
    global tax settlement and total charges of $505 million to
    income taxes for the interest cost associated with the leveraged
    lease tax litigation. Also, during 2008, Reconciling Items
    include a $165 million ($103 million after tax) gain
    from the partial redemption of our equity interest in Visa Inc.
    and a $17 million charge to income taxes for the interest
    cost associated with the increase to our tax reserves for
    certain LILO transactions.

Key
    Community Bank summary of operations

As shown in Figure 7, Key Community Bank recorded net income
    attributable to Key of $161 million for 2010, compared to a
    net loss of $56 million for 2009, and net income of
    $356 million for 2008. The increase in 2010 was the result
    of improvements in noninterest income, reductions in noninterest
    expense, and a significant decrease in the provision for loan
    and lease losses.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by
    $104 million, or 6%, from 2009 as a result of a decrease in
    average earning assets, a decline in average deposits, and
    tighter deposit spreads. Average loans and leases declined by
    $2.7 billion, or 9%, due to reductions in the commercial
    loan and home equity portfolios, while average deposits declined
    $2.9 billion, or 6%. The decrease in average deposits
    reflects a strong mix shift in the portfolio, as average
    certificates of deposit declined $7 billion in 2010.
    Higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years
    matured and repriced to current market rates, partially offset
    by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts.

Noninterest income increased by $18 million, or 2%, from
    2009 due in part to an increase in trust and investment services
    income of $20 million. Derivative revenue increased
    $21 million from 2009, due primarily to a reduction in the
    provision for credit losses from client derivatives. In
    addition, electronic banking fees increased $12 million, or
    11% from 2009. These positive results were offset in part by a
    $28 million decrease in service charges on deposit
    accounts, resulting from both changes in customer behavior and
    the implementation of Regulation E.

The provision for loan and lease losses declined by
    $318 million, or 44%, from 2009. Key Community Bank’s
    provision in excess of charge-offs for loan and lease losses
    declined by $372 million from 2009 reflecting improving
    economic conditions from one year ago. The improvement in this
    provision was partially offset by a $54 million increase in
    net loan charge-offs.

Noninterest expense decreased by $106 million, or 6%, from
    2009, due in part to a $40 million decrease in the FDIC
    deposit insurance assessment. Also contributing to the

year-over-year

change in noninterest expense was a charge of $21 million
    recorded to the provision for losses on lending-related
    commitments in 2009, compared to a credit of $20 million
    recorded in 2010. Finally, corporate allocated costs declined
    $52 million. The improvement in these areas was partially
    offset by higher business services and professional fees
    reflecting the cost of our third-party mortgage operations and
    the continued investment in our branch network. Over the last
    two years, we have opened 77 new branches and renovated
    approximately 145 others as part of our branch modernization
    initiative.

In 2009, the $412 million decrease in net income
    attributable to Key was due in part to an increase in the
    provision for loan and lease losses of $452 million,
    coupled with a decrease in noninterest income of
    $57 million. In addition, noninterest expense



increased $157 million, primarily due to an increase in
    FDIC deposit insurance expense. These changes more than offset a
    $15 million increase in net interest income.

Key
    Corporate Bank summary of operations

As shown in Figure 8, Key Corporate Bank recorded net income
    attributable to Key of $434 million for 2010, compared to a
    net loss attributable to Key of $1.058 billion for 2009 and
    a net loss attributable to Key of $136 million for 2008.
    The 2010 improvement was primarily due to a substantial decrease
    in the provision for loan and lease losses, improvement in
    noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense. This
    improvement was moderated by a decline in net interest income
    that resulted from a reduction in average earning assets.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by
    $77 million, or 9%, in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily
    to a reduction in average earning assets, offset in part by
    improved earning asset yields and an increase in deferred loan
    fees. Average earning assets fell by $7.1 billion, or 24%,
    due primarily to reductions in the commercial loan portfolios.
    Average deposits declined by $484 million, or 4%.

Noninterest income increased by $170 million, or 24%, from
    2009, due in part to net gains on certain commercial real estate
    investments. During 2010, these gains on certain commercial real
    estate investments totaled $7 million as compared to losses
    of $137 million in 2009 which reflected reductions in the
    fair values of certain commercial real estate related
    investments made by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate
    Banking Services line of business. Also contributing to the
    improvement in noninterest



income was a $48 million improvement in net losses from
    loan sales, a $29 million improvement in investment banking
    income, and a $28 million gain from the sale of Tuition
    Management Systems in December 2010. The growth in noninterest
    income was offset in part by a $35 million decrease in
    trust and investment services income which was primarily due to
    reduced brokerage commissions in the Institutional and Capital
    Markets line of business. Noninterest income was also adversely
    impacted by a $29 million decline in operating lease
    revenue and a $13 million decrease in letter of credit fees.

The provision for loan and lease losses declined by
    $1.854 billion from 2009, reflecting lower levels of net
    loan charge-offs, primarily from the commercial loan portfolio.
    Key Corporate Bank’s provision for loan and lease losses
    was less than net loan charge-offs by $635 million as we
    continued to experience improved asset quality.

During 2009, noninterest expense was adversely affected by
    intangible asset impairment charges totaling $241 million.
    These charges resulted from reductions in the estimated fair
    value of the Key Corporate Bank reporting unit caused by
    weakness in the financial markets and the write-off of other
    intangible assets related to our leasing operation. Excluding
    these intangible asset charges, noninterest expense declined by
    $86 million, or 8%, from 2009, due primarily to a
    $21 million credit to provision for losses on
    lending-related commitments recorded during 2010, compared to a
    $45 million charge recorded in 2009. A $20 million
    decline in operating lease expense, lower FDIC deposit insurance
    assessment, and a decrease in internally allocated overhead and
    support costs also contributed to the decrease in noninterest
    expense. These factors were partially offset by a
    $20 million increase in OREO expense, and increases in both
    personnel expense and miscellaneous expense.

In 2009, results were less favorable than they were in 2008 due
    to a $38 million, or 4%, reduction in net interest income,
    an $11 million, or 2%, decrease in noninterest income, and
    a $1.322 billion increase in the provision for loan and
    lease losses and a $121 million, or 10%, increase in
    noninterest expense. Noninterest expense in 2008 included an
    intangible asset impairment charge of $217 million compared
    to the $241 million charge in 2009 and a $7 million
    credit provision for losses on lending related-commitments
    compared to the $45 million charge in 2009.

Consistent with our strategy to focus on core relationship
    businesses, we sold Tuition Management Systems in December 2010.

Other
    Segments

Other Segments consists of Corporate Treasury, our Principal
    Investing unit and various exit portfolios that previously were
    included in the Key Corporate Bank segment. These exit
    portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter
    of



2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current
    reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other
    Segments generated a net loss attributable to Key of
    $14 million for 2010, compared to a net loss attributable
    to Key of $359 million for 2009. The results reflect a
    $277 million increase in net interest income and a decrease
    in the loan loss provision of $331 million. Noninterest
    income results declined $173 million as increases in net
    gains from principal investing (including results attributable
    to noncontrolling interests) of $70 million, net gains on
    loan sales of $23 million and income from corporate-owned
    life insurance of $22 million were more than offset by
    declines in net securities gains of $126 million, gains on
    sales of leased equipment of $75 million and net gains of
    $78 million related to the exchange of common shares for
    capital securities during 2009. Noninterest expense results
    declined $110 million as OREO expense decreased
    $46 million, operating lease expense decreased
    $31 million and support and overhead charges decreased
    $20 million.

In 2009, Other Segments generated a net loss attributable to Key
    of $359 million, compared to a net loss attributable to Key
    of $1.2 billion for 2008. The results reflect a
    $564 million increase in net interest income and a decrease
    in the loan loss provision of $165 million. In 2008, net
    interest income was negatively impacted as a result of certain
    leveraged lease financing transactions that were challenged by
    the IRS. Noninterest income results improved $315 million
    as a result of increases in net securities gains of
    $125 million, net gains of $78 million related to the
    exchange of common shares for capital securities during 2009,
    gains on sales of leased equipment of $55 million and net
    gains from principal investing (including results attributable
    to noncontrolling interests) of $51 million. Noninterest
    expense results declined $197 million as the OREO expense
    increase of $54 million was more than offset by a decline
    in various other expense categories.

Results
    of Operations

Net
    interest income

One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income.
    Net interest income is the difference between interest income
    received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and
    loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits
    and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net
    interest income, including:

♦

the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities;

♦

the volume and value of net free funds, such as
    noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;

♦

the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;

♦

interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the
    marketplace; and

♦

asset quality.

To make it easier to compare results among several periods and
    the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable,
    some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on
    a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all
    taxable and at the same taxable rate). For example, $100 of
    tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount
    that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax
    rate of 35% — would yield $100.

Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that
    affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields
    or rates over the past six years. This figure also presents a
    reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net
    interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of
    those years. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of
    the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of
    funding, is calculated by dividing net interest income by
    average earning assets.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2010 was
    $2.537 billion, and the net interest margin was 3.26%.
    These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income
    of $2.406 billion and a net interest margin of 2.83% for
    the prior year. The increase in the 2010 net interest
    margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We
    continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by
    reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and
    growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the
    net interest margin was partially offset during 2010 by a lower
    level of average earning assets compared to the prior year
    resulting primarily from pay downs on loans. We also experienced
    improved yields on loans due to lower levels of nonperforming
    loans. Compared to the prior year, funding costs were also
    reduced by maturities of long-term debt and the 2009 exchanges
    of capital securities for our Common Shares.

In the prior year, the net interest margin remained under
    pressure as the federal funds target rate was at low levels.
    This resulted in a larger decrease in the interest rates on
    earning assets than that experienced for interest-bearing
    liabilities. Further compression of the 2009 net interest
    margin came from higher levels of nonperforming assets and the
    termination of certain leveraged lease financing arrangements.

Average earning assets for 2010 totaled $78.4 billion,
    which was $6.7 billion, or 8%, lower than the 2009 level.
    This reduction reflects a $12.4 billion decrease in loans
    during the year, caused by soft demand for credit, paydowns on
    our portfolios as



commercial clients deleveraged, and the run-off in our exit
    portfolios. The decline in loans was partially offset by an
    increase of $7.6 billion in securities available for sale.

The size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by
    the following actions during 2010 and 2009:

♦

We sold $1.2 billion of commercial real estate loans during
    2010 and $1.3 billion during 2009. Since some of these
    loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a
    risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or
    representations made in the sales agreements), we established
    and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe
    is appropriate. More information about the related recourse
    agreement is provided in Note 16 (“Commitments,
    Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading
    “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”

♦

In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans
    discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $2 billion
    (including $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans)
    during 2010 and $1.8 billion (including $1.5 billion
    of residential real estate loans) during 2009.

♦

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair
    value of $82 million from

held-for-sale

status to the

held-to-maturity

portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our
    related plans to restructure the terms of these loans.

♦

We sold $487 million of education loans (included in
    “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet) during
    2010, and $474 million during 2009. In late September 2009,
    we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending
    business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to
    the education lending business for all periods presented in this
    report.

♦

We transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million,
    net of $55 million in net charge-offs) from the

held-to-maturity

loan portfolio to

held-for-sale

status in late September 2009, in conjunction with additional
    actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real
    estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected
    assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009.

Noninterest
    income

Noninterest income for 2010 was $1.954 billion, down
    $81 million, or 4%, from 2009. In 2009, noninterest income
    increased by $188 million, or 10%, compared to 2008.

Several significant items affected noninterest income in 2010
    and 2009. In 2010, we realized a gain of $28 million from
    the sale of Tuition Management Systems, which is recorded in
    miscellaneous income. In 2009, significant items include net
    gains of $125 million from the repositioning of the
    securities portfolio, $78 million recorded in connection
    with the exchange of Common Shares for capital securities,
    $32 million from the sale of our claim associated with the
    Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy and $105 million gain from
    the sale of Visa Inc. shares.

Excluding the above items, noninterest income for 2010 increased
    by $231 million. As shown in Figure 11, we benefited from a
    $187 million increase in investment banking and capital
    market income, $76 million in net gains from loan sales in
    2010 compared to a $1 million loss in 2009, and
    $66 million in net gains from principal investing
    (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in
    2010 compared to a $4 million loss in 2009. These favorable
    results were partially offset by a $79 million decline in
    net gains on sale of leased equipment.

Significant items also influence a comparison of noninterest
    income for 2009 with that reported for 2008. We recorded a
    $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares in
    2009, compared to a $165 million gain from the partial
    redemption of Visa shares during 2008.

Excluding the above items, noninterest income for 2009 increased
    by $13 million. As shown in Figure 11, we benefited from an
    $81 million reduction in net losses from loan sales, a
    $59 million increase in net gains on sales of leased
    equipment, a $50 million decrease in net losses from
    principal investing (including results attributable to
    noncontrolling interest) and an increase in other income, due
    primarily to mortgage banking activities and the volatility
    associated with the hedge accounting applied to debt
    instruments. These factors were substantially offset by less
    favorable results from investment banking and capital



market activities, as well as reductions in trust and investment
    services income, service charges on deposit accounts and
    operating lease income.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain
    elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused
    those elements to change.

Trust and
    investment services income

Trust and investment services are our largest source of
    noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated
    by these services are shown in Figure 12. The 2010 decrease of
    $15 million, or 3%, is primarily attributable to lower
    fixed income sales reflected in brokerage commissions and fees.
    The increase in personal asset management and custody fees is
    largely offset by the impact of outflows in security lending
    assets and money market mutual funds reflected in institutional
    asset management and custody fees.

In 2009, we experienced a decrease of $50 million, or 10%,
    in trust and investment services income, which is attributable
    to reductions in both institutional and personal asset
    management income, as well as lower income from brokerage
    commissions and fees.

A significant portion of our trust and investment services
    income depends on the value and mix of assets under management.
    At December 31, 2010, our bank, trust and registered
    investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of



$59.8 billion, compared to $66.9 billion at
    December 31, 2009. As shown in Figure 13, most of the
    decrease was attributable to reductions in the securities
    lending and money market portfolios, offset by an increase in
    the equity portfolio. The decline in the securities lending
    portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities, a
    decline on spreads, and client departures. When clients’
    securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash
    collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The
    difference between the revenue generated from the investment and
    the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client.
    This business, although profitable, generates a significantly
    lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk)
    than other types of assets under management. The decline in the
    money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate
    environment as clients look for higher yields in other
    investment strategies. The decrease in the value of our
    portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter
    2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.

Service
    charges on deposit accounts

The 2010 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts is due
    primarily to changing client behaviors involving lower overdraft
    transactions, which generate overdraft fees as well as a decline
    in other deposit service charge related fees. A recent component
    of the decrease was due to the implementation of
    Regulation E, which went into effect on July, 1, 2010 for
    new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients.
    The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated
    with existing Regulation E rules was in line with our
    expectations.

The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to lower
    overdraft transactions, which generated fewer overdraft fees.
    Additionally, because of the prevailing low interest rates and
    unlimited FDIC insurance, our corporate clients maintained
    larger amounts on deposit, which has the effect of reducing
    transaction service charges on their noninterest-bearing deposit
    accounts.

Operating
    lease income

Reduced originations of operating leases in 2010 were due to the
    related economics and resulted in a $54 million decrease in
    operating equipment leases recorded in the Equipment Finance
    line of business. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 15,
    depreciation expense associated with operating leases also
    declined. The $43 million decrease in 2009 operating lease
    income is also due to reduced originations.

Investment
    banking and capital markets income (loss)

As shown in Figure 14, income from investment banking and
    capital markets activities increased $187 million in 2010.
    Other investment income increased $109 million from 2009
    resulting from lower losses from changes in the fair value of
    certain investments made by our Funds Management Group within
    Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of
    business in Key Corporate Bank. At December 31, 2010, these
    securities had a carrying amount of approximately
    $1 million, representing 3% of their face value. Dealer
    trading and derivative losses decreased $54 million from
    2009 due largely to a $36 million decrease in the provision
    for losses related to customer derivatives and $14 million
    decrease related to credit default



swap valuation adjustments. Investment banking income also
    increased $29 million due primarily to increased levels of
    debt and equity financings.

The 2009 decline was driven by losses related to certain
    commercial real estate related investments, primarily due to
    changes in their fair values. Net losses from investments made
    by the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line
    of business rose by $68 million from 2008. We also
    experienced a $36 million increase in losses associated
    with dealer trading and derivatives, due largely to credit
    default swap valuation adjustments.

Net gains
    (losses) from loan sales

We sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk
    profiles of the overall loan portfolio. During 2010, we recorded
    $76 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net
    losses of $1 million during 2009. We saw market liquidity
    strengthen beginning in the latter half of 2010 and took the
    opportunity to continue to sell our nonperforming loans. We were
    encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at
    values close to their carrying values recorded on our books. The
    types of loans sold during 2010 and 2009 are presented in Figure
    22.

Net gains
    (losses) from principal investing

Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments
    in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal
    investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it
    is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small
    to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the
    balance sheet at fair value ($898 million at
    December 31, 2010, and $1.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009). We had $66 million in gains from
    principal investing for 2010, as presented in Figure 11. These
    gains are derived largely from changes in fair values, in our
    indirect and venture capital areas, as well as sales of
    principal investments.

Noninterest
    expense

As shown in Figure 15, noninterest expense for 2010 was
    $3.034 billion, down $520 million, or 15%, from 2009.
    In 2009, noninterest expense rose by $78 million, or 2%
    from 2008.

In 2010, personnel expense decreased by
    $43 million.  Excluding intangible assets
    impairment charges of $241 million, nonpersonnel expense
    decreased by $279 million due primarily to a
    $115 million decrease in provision for losses on
    lending-related commitments, a $53 million decrease in FDIC
    assessment expense, a $53 million decrease in operating
    lease expense and a $29 million decrease in OREO expense.

The decrease in provision for losses on lending-related
    commitments is due to a $48 million credit during 2010 as a
    result of improved credit quality and a lower level of unfunded
    commitments.

FDIC assessment expense decreased because we recorded a one-time
    special assessment in the second quarter of 2009, the result of
    opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010 and
    because insured deposits decreased.

OREO expense decreased as a result of improved liquidity for
    income producing properties in 2010, resulting in fewer
    write-downs compared to one year ago.

In 2009, personnel expense decreased by $67 million from
    2008. Excluding intangible assets impairment charges,
    nonpersonnel expense increased by $373 million, due
    primarily to a $167 million increase in the FDIC deposit
    insurance assessment, a $81 million increase in costs
    associated with OREO, a $46 million increase in business
    services and professional fees and a $67 million provision
    for losses on lending-related commitments recorded during the
    current year, compared to a $26 million credit recorded for
    2008. Additionally, nonpersonnel expense for 2009 was reduced by
    a $23 million credit (included in “miscellaneous
    expense”), representing the reversal of the remaining
    litigation reserve associated with the previously reported



Honsador litigation settled in September 2008. The increase in
    nonpersonnel expense, compared to 2009, was moderated by
    decreases of $29 million in operating lease expense and
    $15 million in marketing expense. More information about
    the intangible assets impairment charges is provided in this
    section under the heading “Intangible assets
    impairment.”

The following discussion explains the composition of certain
    elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused
    those elements to change.

Personnel

As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense, the largest category
    of our noninterest expense, decreased by $43 million, or
    3%, in 2010, following a $67 million, or 4%, decline in
    2009 from 2008. The 2010 decrease was due largely to a
    $79 million decrease in our employee benefits expense. The
    employee benefits expense decrease was caused by a decline in
    pension expense as a result of amending our pension plans to
    freeze all benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain
    pension plan assumptions. For more information related to our
    pension plans, see Note 19 (“Employee Benefits”).
    Severance expense also decreased by $17 million. The
    decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by
    $44 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on
    improved profitability and an increase of $1 million in
    stock-based compensation. The $8 million increase in
    salaries includes an $18 million decline in levels of
    deferred compensation (which has the effect of increasing
    salaries) and the impact of base salary increases, which are
    partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and the
    impact of a 7% decrease in the number of average full-time
    equivalent employees from 2009.

The 2009 decrease was due largely to a reduction in incentive
    compensation accruals and salaries expense. The $44 million
    decrease in salaries includes a $38 million decline in
    levels of deferred compensation (which has the effect of
    increasing salaries) and the impact of base salary increases,
    which are partially offset by lower levels of contract labor and
    the impact of an 8% decrease in the number of average full-time
    equivalent employees. We also experienced a substantial increase
    in pension expense in 2009 attributed primarily to lower
    expected returns and an increase in the amortization of losses,
    resulting from the decrease in the value of pension plan assets
    following steep declines in the equity markets in 2008.

    $3 million in 2009 and ($.8) million in 2008 reported
    as “miscellaneous expense” in Figure 15.

Intangible
    assets impairment

During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $45 million
    charge to write-off intangible assets, other than goodwill,
    associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in
    certain equipment leasing markets. During the first quarter of
    2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Key
    Corporate Bank reporting unit was less than the carrying amount,
    reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets. As a
    result, we recorded a pre-tax noncash accounting charge of
    $223 million, of which $27 million related to the
    discontinued operations of Austin. As a result of this charge,
    we have now written off all of the goodwill that had been
    assigned to Key Corporate Bank.

Operating
    lease expense

The decrease in operating lease expense in both 2010 and 2009 is
    primarily attributable to product run-off. Income related to the
    rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as
    “operating lease income.”

FDIC
    Assessment

FDIC assessment expense was unfavorably impacted in 2009
    primarily by a one time special assessment recorded in the
    second quarter of 2009. This increase was partially offset by
    opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010.

OREO
    expense

OREO expense decreased in 2010 primarily as a result of
    $7 million in net gain on sales recorded in 2010 compared
    to net loss on sales of $26 million in 2009. OREO expense
    increased $81 million in 2009 from 2008 due largely to
    valuation write-downs totaling $60 million.

Provision
    (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments

The provision for losses on lending-related commitments
    fluctuated during the prior year as a result of variability in
    underlying credit quality and levels of unfunded commitments.

Income
    taxes

We recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of
    $186 million for 2010, compared to a tax benefit of
    $1.035 billion for 2009 and a provision of
    $437 million for 2008. The effective tax rate, which is the
    provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from
    continuing operations before income taxes, was 23.4% for 2010,
    compared to 45.0% for 2009 and (51.4%) for 2008.

Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that
    would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate,
    primarily because we generate income from investments in
    tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance,
    earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing
    projects and make periodic adjustments, to our tax reserves.
    During 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of
    $32 million as the result of management’s change in
    assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non-US subsidiaries.
    Additionally, in 2009, we recorded a $106 million credit to
    income taxes, due primarily to the settlement of IRS audits for
    the tax years

1997-2006.

The credit includes a final adjustment of $80 million
    related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues.
    In 2008, we recorded $586 million tax provision in
    connection with the leverage lease tax litigation, which became
    final in 2009.

In late March 2009, we transferred
    $1.5 billion of loans from the construction portfolio to
    the commercial mortgage portfolio in accordance with regulatory
    guidelines pertaining to the classification of loans for
    projects that have reached a completed status.



(c)

Excludes loans in the amount of
    $6.5 billion at December 31, 2010, $3.5 billion
    at December 31, 2009, $3.7 billion at
    December 31, 2008, $331 million at December 31,
    2007, and $345 million at December 31, 2006, related
    to the discontinued operations of the education lending business.

At December 31, 2010, total loans outstanding were
    $50.1 billion, compared to $58.8 billion at the end of
    2009 and $72.8 billion at the end of 2008. Loans related to
    the discontinued operations of the education lending business,
    and excluded from total loans were $6.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010, $3.5 billion at December 31,
    2009, and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Further
    information regarding our discontinued operations is provided in
    the section entitled “Consumer loan portfolio” within
    this discussion. The decrease in our loans from continuing
    operations over the past two years reflects reductions in most
    of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the
    commercial portfolio.

Commercial
    loan portfolio

Commercial loans outstanding were $34.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010, a decrease of $7.4 billion, or 18%,
    since December 31, 2009. This decrease was caused by
    continued soft demand for credit due to our clients’ use of
    the strength of the capital markets to raise debt and equity,
    pay downs on our portfolios and the run-off in our exit loan
    portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk. We are beginning to
    see pockets of improvements in commercial lending as business is
    strengthening in certain regions.

Commercial, financial and
    agricultural.

As shown in Figure 17, our Commercial,
    Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as
    “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 33% of our
    total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and are
    the largest component of our total loans. The loans are
    comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle
    market and small business clients. These loans decreased
    $2.8 billion or 15% from one year ago. Most of the decrease
    which occurred during the first half of 2010 was attributable to
    our clients using the capital markets to pay down their bank
    debt. In the latter half of 2010, our commercial, financial and
    agricultural portfolio began to stabilize.

Commercial real estate loans.

Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 23% of our
    total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and
    nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 34% of
    our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in Figure 18, at
    December 31, 2010, our commercial real estate portfolio
    included mortgage loans of $9.5 billion and construction
    loans of $2.1 billion. The total commercial real estate
    loans for 2010 and 2009 represent 23% and 26%, respectively, of
    our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represent 16% of our
    total loans and owner-occupied loans represent 7% of our total
    loans. The average mortgage loan originated during 2010 was
    $2.9 million, and our largest mortgage loan at
    December 31, 2010, had a balance of $121 million. At
    December 31, 2010, our average construction loan commitment
    was $3.8 million. Our largest construction loan commitment
    was $49 million, $48.1 million of which was
    outstanding at December 31, 2010.

Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through
    two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real
    Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line
    of business within Key Corporate Bank that cultivates
    relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This
    line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied
    properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the
    debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated
    third parties) and accounted for approximately 60% of our
    average

year-to-date

commercial real estate loans during 2010, compared to 59% one
    year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses
    on larger real estate developers and owners. As shown in
    Figure 18, this loan portfolio is diversified by both
    property type and geographic location of the underlying
    collateral. Figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and
    construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate
    Bank.

During 2010, nonperforming loans related to our
    nonowner-occupied properties decreased by $680 million
    attributable to improved asset quality and market conditions.
    This compares to an increase of $605 million during 2009,
    which was due to the deteriorating market conditions in both the
    income properties and residential properties segments of our
    commercial real estate construction portfolio. As previously
    reported, we have undertaken a process to reduce our exposure in
    the residential properties segment of our construction loan
    portfolio through the sale of certain loans.

The secondary market for income property loans has been severely
    constrained for the past three years and is expected to remain
    so for the foreseeable future. In years prior to the economic
    downturn, we did not provide permanent financing for our clients
    upon the completion of their construction projects; permanent
    financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage-backed
    securities market or other lenders. With other sources of
    permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained, we are
    currently providing interim financing for certain of our
    relationship clients when their commercial real estate
    construction projects are completed. During 2010 and 2009, we
    extended the maturities, for up to five years, of certain
    existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients
    with projects at or near completion. We applied normal customary
    underwriting standards to these longer-term extensions and
    generally received market rates of interest and additional fees,
    offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate,
    to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates. In
    cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for
    similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to
    the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In 2010, there were
    $204 million of new restructured loans included in
    nonperforming loans, of which $67 million related to
    commercial real estate.

As shown in Figure 18, at December 31, 2010, 68% of our
    commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied
    properties, compared to 71% at December 31, 2009.
    Approximately 23% and 40% of these loans were construction loans
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Typically,
    these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the
    loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the
    life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support
    debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally
    slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the
    turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy
    rates down. As we have experienced during 2010, we expect
    vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain
    elevated and possibly increase well into 2011.

Commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching
    bottom, and certain sectors (i.e., apartments) are showing solid
    signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio
    Research, Inc., vacancy fell in the third quarter of 2010 in
    every major property type, but it remained above year-ago levels
    with the exception of apartments. Rent growth remains flat to
    negative (again with the exception of apartments), and is at or
    nearing a trough; however, modest declines are possible over the
    next year in office, retail, and warehouse property types. Once
    rents bottom, the anticipated recovery will likely be modest.

If the economic recovery stalls,

and/or

job
    growth continues to disappoint, vacancies will remain elevated
    and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will
    remain. The resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in
    the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real
    estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and
    office buildings components, which comprise 27% of our
    commercial real estate loans.

Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having
    experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90%
    since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics,
    LLC Commercial Property Price Index (December 2010) shows a
    42% drop in values from the peak, up 3.2% in the past year. As
    of October 2010, prices were up a modest 1.3% over the prior
    month, the second consecutive monthly gain. While overall prices
    may be reaching a bottom, market averages obscure divergent
    trends by asset quality and location. Competition for the best
    assets in the top markets is driving prices higher, while weak
    demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for
    distressed assets low and keeping trends negative.

If the factors described above result in further weakening in
    the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market
    (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset
    values), and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service
    payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength
    of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely
    affected.

Commercial lease financing.

We
    conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance
    line of business and have both the scale and array of products
    to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial
    lease financing receivables represented 19% of commercial loans
    at December 31, 2010, and 18% at December 31, 2009. As
    previously reported, we ceased conducting new business in both
    the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets
    during the second half of 2009.



Commercial
    loan modification and restructuring

Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal
    course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and
    are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive
    to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many
    cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the
    credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income
    sources.

Modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually
    agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the
    same time meeting our clients’ financing needs.
    Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not
    experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances
    where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not
    in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with
    applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when
    the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a
    creditor concession has been granted.

Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate
    reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal.
    Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary
    concession types. The table below provides the amount of TDRs by
    the primary type of concession made at each period end. Since
    our volume of TDR activity is relatively new over the last five
    quarters, it is too early to gauge the success of the different
    types of concessions. Our success will be significantly
    influenced by economic conditions going forward. Although we
    have restructured these loans to provide the best opportunity
    for successful repayment by the borrowers, given the uncertainty
    of the current economic situation, we are not able to predict
    how these restructured notes will ultimately perform.

Figure 19 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing
    and nonaccruing TDRs.

The benefits derived from multiple note TDRs are recognized
    when the underlying assets (predominantly commercial real
    estate) have been stabilized with a level of leverage
    supportable by ongoing cash flows. Right-sizing the A note to
    sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to
    accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income
    recognition. Similarly, appropriately sized A notes will allow
    for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit
    metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other
    benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and
    control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital
    structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the
    transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing
    distressed/fire sales.

As the objective of the multiple notes TDR is to achieve a
    fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing the A
    note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to
    service debt at current market terms and consistent with our
    customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a
    debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly
    payments of market interest and principal amortization of
    generally not more than 25 years.

The B note is typically an interest only note with no required
    amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess
    cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal.
    The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual
    restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases,
    the B note has then been charged-off contemporaneously with the
    A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A
    and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit
    metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a
    three (A, B, C) note structure has been utilized, the C
    notes are fully charged-off at the time of the TDR. In the very
    few instances where the C note is not charged-off, there is a
    pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of
    developed units that support the C note balance shortly after
    the TDR.

All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any
    non-charged-off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the
    year in which they are consummated. Returning an A note to
    accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the
    balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time.

Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and
    interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary
    repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk
    of continued sustainability while secondary repayment
    (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds
    the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess
    (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline,
    considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s
    circumstances.

Extensions

Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal
    course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically
    refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at
    maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent
    commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and
    the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an
    increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms
    take into account the specific circumstances of the client
    relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects
    for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing
    and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified
    to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of
    return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term)
    that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include
    one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased
    amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees,

and/or

a
    cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing
    construction loans have automatic extension options built in and
    in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension
    option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project
    loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as
    cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate
    provides for repayment of the loan.

Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the
    borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any.
    Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is
    already priced at or above current market). We do not consider
    loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing
    loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when
    ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in
    doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan
    extensions outside of the normal course of business—where
    either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or
    a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under
    the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a
    TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment
    under the applicable accounting guidance.

Guarantors

A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new
    extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material
    modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part
    of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This
    analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all
    appropriate financial statements including balance sheets,
    income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.

While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have
    some minor differences, the high level objectives include
    reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions
    of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature
    of asset base;



net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value);
    leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent
    and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.

Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at
    least annually within

90-120 days

of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent
    rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some
    cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity,
    certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and
    real estate schedules may be required more frequently.

We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt,
    if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would
    not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which
    we are precluded by bankruptcy

and/or

it is
    determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to
    be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial
    condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary
    payment

and/or

the
    cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss,
    cost and the expense of collections.

As of December 31, 2010, we had $507 million of
    mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio
    greater than 1.0 and were accounted for as performing loans.
    These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of
    the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service
    the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization;
    a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable
    guarantor support.

Consumer
    loan portfolio

Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.3 billion, or
    8%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 41 in the “Credit
    risk management” section, the majority of the reduction
    came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is
    attributable to the marine segment.

The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer
    loan portfolio. Virtually all of this portfolio (93% at
    December 31, 2010) is derived primarily from the
    Regional Banking line of business within our Key Community Bank.
    The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode
    since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the
    Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other
    Segments. Home equity loans within Key Community Bank decreased
    by $534 million, or 5%, over the past twelve months.

Figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at
    the end of each of the last five years, as well as certain asset
    quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

From continuing operations.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our
    consumer loan portfolio. We expect the portfolio continue to
    decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit
    dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending
    for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue
    the education lending business. We ceased originating new
    education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for
    this business in discontinued operations.

In the latter half of 2010, there has been public controversy
    surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our
    number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of
    new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties,
    initiated per month, through December 31, 2010 is 140,
    compared to approximately 238,000 such mortgage loans) and
    primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A
    review of our foreclosure processes (which is still ongoing) has
    not uncovered any material defects in the process of signing and
    notarizing affidavits.



Loans
    held for sale

As shown in Note 4 (“Loans and Loans Held for
    Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to
    $467 million at December 31, 2010 from
    $443 million at December 31, 2009. Loans held for sale
    related to the discontinued operations of the education lending
    business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, totaled
    $15 million and $434 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, loans held for sale included
    $118 million of commercial mortgages which decreased by
    $53 million from December 31, 2009, and
    $110 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased
    by $29 million from December 31, 2009. In the absence
    of quoted market prices, we use valuation models to measure the
    fair value of these loans and adjust the amount recorded on the
    balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost. The
    models are based on third-party data, as well as assumptions
    related to prepayment speeds, default rates, funding cost,
    discount rates and other relevant market available inputs. In
    light of the volatility in the financial markets, we have
    reviewed our assumptions and determined that they reflect
    current market conditions. As a result, no significant
    adjustments to our assumptions were required during 2010.

During 2010, we recorded net unrealized losses of
    $10 million and net realized gains of $44 million on
    our loans held for sale portfolio. These net gains are reported
    in “net gains (losses) from loan sales” on the income
    statement. We have not been significantly impacted by market
    volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry, having
    exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006.

Loan
    sales

As shown in Figure 22, during 2010, we sold $1.2 billion of
    commercial real estate loans, $1.6 billion of residential
    real estate loans, $370 million of commercial loans and
    $64 million of commercial lease financing. Most of these
    sales came from the

held-for-sale

portfolio. Additionally, we sold $487 million of education
    loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the
    balance sheet), which are excluded from Figure 22. Due to
    unfavorable market conditions, we have not securitized any
    education loans since 2006.

Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to
    sell are:

♦

whether particular lending businesses meet established
    performance standards or fit with our relationship banking
    strategy;

♦

our A/LM needs;

♦

the cost of alternative funding sources;

♦

the level of credit risk;

♦

capital requirements; and

♦

market conditions and pricing.

In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to
    recourse with respect to approximately $736 million of the
    $118 billion of loans administered or serviced at
    December 31, 2010. Additional information about this
    recourse arrangement is included in Note 16
    (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”)
    under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”

We derive income from several sources when retaining the right
    to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn
    noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from
    fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is
    reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In
    addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated
    by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of
    commercial real estate loans. Additional information about our
    mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 9
    (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).

Maturities and sensitivity of certain loans to changes in
    interest rates

Figure 24 shows the remaining maturities of certain commercial
    and real estate loans, and the sensitivity of those loans to
    changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010,
    approximately 38% of these outstanding loans were scheduled to
    mature within one year.

Securities

Our securities portfolio totaled $22.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010, compared to $16.7 billion at
    December 31, 2009. At each of these dates, most of our
    securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the
    remainder consisting of

held-to-maturity

securities of less than $25 million.



Securities available for sale

The majority of our securities

available-for-sale

portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by
    a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate
    interest income and serve as collateral to support certain
    pledging agreements. At December 31, 2010, we had
    $21.7 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed
    securities in the

available-for-sale

portfolio, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31,
    2009.

As shown in Figure 25, all of our mortgage-backed securities are
    issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and are
    traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the
    balance sheet at fair value. We employ an outside bond pricing
    service to determine the fair value at which these securities
    should be recorded on the balance sheet. In performing the
    valuations, the pricing service relies on models that consider
    security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and
    economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are
    quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant
    benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions. We
    review valuations derived from the models to ensure they are
    consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded
    in the secondary markets.

During 2010, we had net gains of $203 million from CMOs and
    other mortgage-backed securities, all of which were unrealized.
    The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market
    interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of
    shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate
    asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.

We periodically evaluate our securities

available-for-sale

portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing
    market conditions that could affect the profitability of the
    portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are
    exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust
    our overall balance sheet positioning.

In addition, the size and composition of our securities

available-for-sale

portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent
    to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as
    collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although
    we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets,
    such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters
    of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost
    of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.

During 2010, our investing activities continue to complement
    other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing
    liquidity management needs. We purchased $9.8 billion in
    CMOs, and had maturities and cash flows of $4.7 billion.
    The purchases were in CMOs issued by government-sponsored
    entities or GNMA. We are able to either pledge these securities
    to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured
    borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with
    repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be
    required in the future.

Figure 26 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities
    of our securities available for sale. For more information about
    these securities, including gross unrealized gains and losses by
    type of security and securities pledged, see Note 7
    (“Securities”).

Other
    investments

Principal investments — investments in equity and
    mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing
    unit — represented 66% of other investments at
    December 31, 2010. They include direct investments
    (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect
    investments (investments made through funds that include other
    investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in
    privately held companies and are carried at fair value
    ($898 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009).

In addition to principal investments, “other
    investments” include other equity and mezzanine
    instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments
    that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of
    investments that generally are carried at cost.

Most of our other investments are not traded on an active
    market. We determine the fair value at which these investments
    should be recorded based on the nature of the specific
    investment and all available relevant information. Among other
    things, our review may encompass such factors as the
    issuer’s past financial performance and future potential,
    the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the
    risks associated with the particular business or investment
    type, current market



conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the
    issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and
    third party data. During 2010, net gains from our principal
    investing activities (including results attributable to
    noncontrolling interests) totaled $66 million, which
    includes $59 million of net unrealized gains. These net
    gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal
    investing” on the income statement.

Deposits
    and other sources of funds

Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During
    2010, these deposits averaged $62.5 billion and represented
    80% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning
    assets, compared to $66.2 billion and 78% during 2009. The
    composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the
    section entitled “Net interest income.”

The decrease in average domestic deposits compared to 2009 was
    due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more)
    and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase
    in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and
    noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to
    change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and
    reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances
    to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and
    money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives
    for investing in the current low-rate environment.

Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office
    and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.5 billion during
    2010, compared to $4.3 billion during 2009. The change
    resulted from a $124 million increase in foreign office
    deposits and a $426 million increase in federal funds
    purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase,
    which was offset partially by a $1.4 billion decline in
    bank notes and other short-term borrowings.

Substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to
    applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, we are subject to
    deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. On
    November 17, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule to
    announce an amended DIF restoration plan requiring depository
    institutions, such as KeyBank, to prepay, on December 30,
    2009, their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the
    third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and
    2012. On that date, KeyBank paid the FDIC $539 million to
    cover the insurance assessments for those time periods. For
    2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was $124 million. At
    the end of the year, we had $388 million of prepaid FDIC
    insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet.

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted their final rule on
    assessments. Under the final rule, which is effective on
    April 1, 2011, KeyBank’s annualized deposit insurance
    premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100
    of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard
    performance incorporating KeyBank’s regulatory rating,
    ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and
    relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event
    of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for

Capital

At December 31, 2010, our shareholders’ equity was
    $11.1 billion, up $454 million from December 31,
    2009. The following discusses certain factors that contributed
    to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other
    factors that contributed to the change, see the section entitled
    “Statement of Changes in Equity.”

Adoption of new accounting guidance

Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation
    accounting guidance that required us to consolidate our
    education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued
    assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in
    assets, liabilities and equity to our balance sheet. As a result
    of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect
    adjustment (after-tax) of $45 million to beginning retained
    earnings on January 1, 2010.



Dividends

During 2010, we made dividend payments of $125 million to
    the U.S. Treasury on our Series B Preferred Stock as a
    participant in the U.S. Treasury’s CPP.

Also, we made four quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per
    share or $6 million per quarter, on our Series A
    Preferred Stock.

Additionally, during 2010, we made four quarterly dividend
    payments of $.01 per share, or $9 million per quarter, on
    our Common Shares.

Common Shares outstanding

Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
    under the symbol KEY. At December 31, 2010, our book value
    per Common Share was $9.52 based on 880.3 million shares
    outstanding at December 31, 2010, compared to $9.04 based
    on 878.5 million shares outstanding at December 31,
    2009. At December 31, 2010 our tangible book value per
    Common Share was $8.45 compared to $7.94 at December 31,
    2009.

Figure 46 in the section entitled “Fourth Quarter
    Results” shows the market price ranges of our Common
    Shares, per Common Share earnings and dividends paid by quarter
    for each of the last two years.

Figure 29 compares the price performance of our Common Shares
    (based on an initial investment of $100 on December 31,
    2004, and assuming reinvestment of dividends) with that of the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a group of other
    banks that constitute our peer group. The peer group consists of
    the banks that make up the Standard & Poor’s 500
    Regional Bank Index and the banks that make up the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Diversified Bank Index. We
    are included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    and the peer group.

At December 31, 2010, we had 65.7 million treasury
    shares, compared to 67.8 million treasury shares at
    December 31, 2009. During 2010, shares previously issued in
    conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us.
    Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in
    connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other
    corporate purposes.

We repurchase Common Shares periodically in the open market or
    through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase
    program authorized by the Board of Directors. The program does
    not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board
    authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not
    repurchase any Common Shares during 2010 or 2009. Further, in
    accordance with the terms of our participation in the CPP, until
    the earlier of three years after the issuance of, or such time
    as the U.S. Treasury no longer holds, any Series B
    Preferred Stock issued by us under that program, we will not be
    able to repurchase any of our Common Shares without the approval
    of the U.S. Treasury, subject to certain limited exceptions
    (e.g., for purchases in connection with benefit plans).

Capital availability and management

As a result of market disruptions in previous periods, we
    closely monitor the availability of capital which had been
    severely restricted for financial services companies to
    different degrees since August 2007. While we have been
    successful in raising additional capital, lower market prices
    per share have increased the dilution of our per Common Share
    results. While the capital markets have recently been more
    favorable, we cannot predict whether those more favorable market
    conditions will continue.

We determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among
    our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk
    parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses. In that
    regard, we will continue to emphasize our client relationship
    strategy.

Capital adequacy

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial
    stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain
    strong at December 31, 2010. Our strong capital and
    improved liquidity position us to adjust to the application of
    any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under
    the Dodd-Frank Act. Our shareholders’ equity to assets
    ratio was 12.10% at December 31, 2010, compared to 11.43%
    at December 31, 2009. Our tangible common equity to
    tangible assets ratio was 8.19% at December 31, 2010,
    compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2009.

Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for
    bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Risk-based
    capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a
    percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted
    assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet
    and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit
    risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must
    maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of
    risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of
    risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of December 31, 2010, our
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased 241 basis
    points from 2009 to 15.16%, and our total risk-based capital
    ratio increased 217 basis points from 2009 to 19.12%.

Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is
    defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average
    quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with
    the condition of the financial institution. BHCs that either
    have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the
    Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market
    risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum
    leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other BHCs must maintain a minimum
    ratio of 4.00%. As of December 31, 2010, our leverage ratio
    increased by 130 basis points from 2009 to 13.02%.

The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory
    capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by
    requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment
    of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities
    (excluding CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or
    any federal government entity before October 4,
    2010) being eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital.

This three year phase-out period, which commences
    January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital
    securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These
    changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital
    requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs,
    savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial
    companies identified as systemically important.

As of December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 risk-based capital
    ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio
    represented 15.16%, 13.02%, and 19.12%, respectively. The trust
    preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank
    capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 229, 196, and
    229 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital
    ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital
    ratio, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.

Under the FDIA prompt corrective action standards, Federal bank
    regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five
    categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to
    “critically undercapitalized.” A “well
    capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed
    thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00%
    for Tier 1 leverage capital, 10.00% for total risk-based



capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order
    or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for
    any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding
    companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at
    December 31, 2010. We believe there has not been any change
    in condition or event since that date that would cause our
    capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis,
    accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities
    as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead)
    as of December 31, 2010, also determines that we would
    qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory
    guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk-based capital
    ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total capital
    ratio being 12.84%, 10.98%, and 19.09%, respectively. The
    current regulatory defined categories serve a limited
    supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma
    ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or
    prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.

Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and
    bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount
    and composition of capital, the calculation of which is
    prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the
    financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its
    assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1
    risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its
    review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically
    important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the
    Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common
    shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based
    capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and
    noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be
    the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, such a
    focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines
    and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The
    modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act are consistent with
    the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the
    consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank
    financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis.
    Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by
    GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations,
    this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure.
    Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our 2010 Performance”
    section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP
    performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the
    corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity
    ratio was 9.34% at December 31, 2010, compared to 7.50% at
    December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2010, we had a consolidated net deferred
    tax asset of $442 million compared to $569 million at
    December 31, 2009. In prior years, we had been in a net
    deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based
    capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon
    future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the
    amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution
    expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end
    date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year,
    or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s
    Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at
    December 31, 2010, $158 million of our net deferred
    tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and
    risk-weighted assets compared to $514 million at
    December 31, 2009. We anticipate that the amount of our net
    deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes
    will decline in coming quarters.

Basel III

On December 15, 2010, the Basel Committee released its
    final framework for strengthening international capital and
    liquidity regulation, now officially identified as “Basel
    III.”

As discussed more fully in this report’s Supervision and
    Regulation section beginning on page 5, Basel III
    requires higher and better quality capital, better risk
    coverage, the introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop to
    the risk-based requirement, measures to promote the build up of
    capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress, the use of
    contingent capital to provide an additional level of protection
    for depositors and creditors, and the introduction of two global
    liquidity standards. Basel III introduces for the first
    time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for
    Tier 1 common equity. When the requirements for the capital
    conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels
    for Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital will be
    higher than the U.S.’s current “well-capitalized”
    minimums. We have prepared pro forma estimates of our capital
    ratios using the Basel III capital guidelines. These
    estimates indicate that our capital levels are currently above
    the Basel III minimums, including the capital conservation
    buffer and the phasing-out of trust preferred securities as
    Tier 1 capital pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The
    U.S. banking regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a
    formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final
    adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. The
    Basel III final capital framework provides for
    implementation to commence January 1, 2013. In light of
    Basel III’s timeline and U.S. regulators support for
    Basel III, a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be issued
    in mid-2011.

The Dodd-Frank Act’s Reform of Deposit Insurance

The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the current FDIC deposit
    insurance limit of $250,000 and provides for temporary unlimited
    FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013 for non
    interest-bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured



depository institutions effective December 31, 2010
    (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG program
    extension). Accordingly, effective December 31, 2010,
    KeyBank will again offer noninterest-bearing demand transaction
    accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when
    it participated in the TLGP.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual
    Obligations

Off-balance sheet arrangements

We are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements,
    which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that
    are not reflected on the balance sheet.

Variable interest entities

A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or
    other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:

♦

The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its
    activities without additional subordinated financial support
    from another party.

♦

The entity’s investors lack the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the entity’s
    economic performance.

♦

The entity’s equity at risk holders do not have the
    obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual
    returns.

♦

The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to
    their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of
    the entity’s activities involve, or are conducted on behalf
    of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for
    consolidations, we also consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a
    variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct
    activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance; and (iii) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the
    primary beneficiary). Additional information regarding the
    nature of VIEs and our involvement with them is included in
    Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies”) under the heading “Basis of
    Presentation” and Note 11 (“Variable Interest
    Entities”).

We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated
    investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have
    significant influence over the entity’s operating and
    financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic
    interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated
    investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a
    voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are
    carried at cost. Investments held by our registered
    broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily
    principal investments) are carried at fair value.

Commitments to extend credit or funding

Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as
    long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These
    commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have
    fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. We
    typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a
    commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully
    utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may
    significantly exceed any related cash outlay. Further
    information about our loan commitments at December 31,
    2010, is presented in Note 16 (“Commitments,
    Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading
    “Commitments to Extend Credit or Funding.” Figure 32
    shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of
    commitment to extend credit or funding. For loan commitments and
    commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum
    possible accounting loss if the borrower were to draw upon the
    full amount of the commitment and then default on payment for
    the total amount of the then outstanding loan.

Other off-balance sheet arrangements

Other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial
    instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in
    accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other
    relationships, such as liquidity support provided to
    asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification
    agreements and intercompany guarantees. Information about such
    arrangements is provided in Note 16 under the heading
    “Other Off-Balance Sheet Risk.”

Guarantees

We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. As
    guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the
    guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate,
    foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the
    occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). These
    variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or
    liability, or another entity’s failure to perform under a
    contract. Additional information regarding these types of
    arrangements is presented in Note 16 under the heading
    “Guarantees.”

Risk
    Management

Overview

Like all financial services companies, we engage in business
    activities and assume the related risks. The most significant
    risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance,
    operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly
    and effectively



identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such
    risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and
    soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are
    defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this
    section.

During 2010, our management team continued to enhance our ERM
    Program. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief
    Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible
    for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile
    is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The
    ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework
    and governance structure for the management of risks across the
    entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management
    Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of
    Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the
    risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk
    categories. We continue to enhance our ERM Program and related
    practices and to use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage
    risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM
    Committee.

Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the
    objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that
    is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The
    Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of
    risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and
    tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant
    risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these
    efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight
    responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk
    Management Committee.

The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal
    audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters;
    the implementation, management and evaluation of operational
    risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and
    evaluating the qualifications and independence of the
    independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies
    related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes
    related to risk review and compliance.

The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing
    the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk
    and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate
    these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks
    relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also
    oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic
    capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports
    and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, reviews reports of
    material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and
    Compliance Risk Committee charters, and approves any material
    changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.

The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as
    appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each
    committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly
    scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to
    discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly
    earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with
    management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming
    meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have
    transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board
    receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of
    significant developments during the interim months.

Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial
    institutions the importance of relating capital management
    strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe
    our internal risk management processes help us achieve and
    maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business
    activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.

Market
    risk management

The values of financial instruments change as a function of
    changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity
    values, commodity prices and other market factors that influence
    prospective market rates or prices. For example, the value of a
    fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase.
    Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly
    fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a
    financial instrument faces “market risk” when the
    value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most
    of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.

Interest
    rate risk management

Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry,
    is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest
    income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may
    result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the
    repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure
    to changes in net interest income and the economic value of
    equity in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy
    limits established by the ERM Committee.

Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of
    factors other than changes in market interest rates, including
    economic conditions, the competitive environment within our
    markets, and balance sheet positioning that arises out of
    consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products. The
    primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of
    basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.



♦

We face

“basis risk”

when floating-rate
    assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time,
    but in response to different market factors or indices. Under
    those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and
    liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income
    may not change by the same amount.

♦

“Gap risk”

occurs if interest-bearing
    liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for
    example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice
    at the same time.

♦

“Yield curve risk”

is the exposure to
    non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the
    yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a
    particular type of security and its term to maturity) if
    interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets
    they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the
    yield curve. For example, if medium term interest rates decline,
    the rates on three to five year automobile loans also will
    decline, but the cost of one to two year certificates of deposit
    may not change.

♦

A financial instrument presents

“option risk”

when one party to the instrument can take advantage of
    changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when
    interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay
    fixed-rate loans and refinance at a lower rate. Such a
    prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal
    plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty,
    that return may not be as high as the return that would have
    been generated had payments been received over the original term
    of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also
    present option risk.

Net interest income simulation
    analysis.

The primary tool we use to measure
    our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of
    this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the
    current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance
    sheet positions and the current and projected interest rate
    environments. The simulation assumes that projections of our on-
    and off-balance sheet positions will reflect recent product
    trends, targets and plans established by the ALCO Committee and
    the lines of business, and consensus economic forecasts.

Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured
    by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur
    if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or
    decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months,
    and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of
    the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a
    gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to
    a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with
    no change over the following ten months. After calculating the
    amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes,
    we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged
    interest rate environment. The analysis also considers
    sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including
    other market interest rates and the mix of earning assets and
    interest-bearing liabilities. We also perform regular stress
    tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could
    materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of
    stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest
    rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed
    using different shapes in the yield curve (the yield curve
    depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type
    of security and its term to maturity), including a sustained
    flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in
    credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest
    rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest
    rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses
    the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed
    discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are
    performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing
    of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending
    spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and
    deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging
    activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.

Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of
    interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption
    inputs into the simulation model. Actual results may differ from
    those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated
    changes to the following inputs: balance sheet composition,
    customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates,
    realized investment, hedging and funding activities. Actual
    results may also differ from those derived in simulation
    analysis due to repercussions from anticipated or unknown
    events. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate
    environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate
    those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are
    performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions
    will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance
    sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk
    profile.

Figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, our
    simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was
    moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk
    management call for the identification of actions that would
    maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling
    demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term
    interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely
    affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%.
    As shown in Figure 33, we are operating within these limits.

As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended
    period of time, we have gradually shifted from a
    liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a
    result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in
    loan balances. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions
    have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities,
    improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar
    magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment
    securities, and this has served to moderate further increases in
    the asset-sensitive positioning. Our current interest rate risk
    position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk
    depending on the competitive environment and client behavior
    that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and pricing of
    loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of
    the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management
    evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported
    interest rate risk profile.

The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of
    alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior
    assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a
    rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results
    may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure
    33. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the
    timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases
    and assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships,
    lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts.

We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes
    in market interest rates in the second year of a two-year
    horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to
    those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term
    exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as
    discussed in the following section.

Economic value of equity modeling.

EVE
    complements net interest income simulation analysis since it
    estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four month
    horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values
    of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may
    change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is
    calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate
    200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and
    measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and
    liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the
    current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE
    under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest
    rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a
    less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve
    term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions
    applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual
    maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors,
    as well as our expectations. We identify actions that would
    maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis
    indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in
    response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these
    guidelines.

Management of interest rate exposure.

We
    use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to
    formulate Asset Liability Management strategies to achieve the
    desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for
    capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we
    manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities,
    issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and
    using derivatives — predominantly in the form of
    interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate
    characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.

Figure 34 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM
    purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual
    interest rate index of

agreed-upon

amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to
    another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is
    converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay
    variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix
    of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader
    A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged.
    For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to
    manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (“Derivatives and
    Hedging Activities”).

Derivatives
    not designated in hedge relationships

Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships
    are described in Note 8. We use a VAR simulation model to
    measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest
    rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads
    on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of
    historical information, the model estimates the maximum
    potential

one-day

loss
    with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that
    losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading
    days, or three to four times each quarter.

We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits
    for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital
    Committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now
    performed by the Market Risk Committee established as part of
    Key’s ERM Program. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate

one-day

trading limit set by the committee was $6.9 million. We are
    operating within these constraints. During 2010, our aggregate
    daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were
    $1.8 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million,
    respectively. In 2009, our aggregate daily average, minimum and
    maximum VAR amounts were $2.8 million, $2.1 million
    and $3.7 million, respectively.

In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily
    basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and
    conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the
    Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.

Liquidity
    risk management

We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves
    maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to
    accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets
    and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.

Governance
    structure

We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated
    basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources
    available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity
    to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that
    adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively
    affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the
    access of all affiliates to sufficient funding.

Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed
    by the KeyCorp Board’s Risk Management Committee, the
    KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO.
    These groups regularly review various liquidity reports,
    including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends,
    peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections,
    hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking
    reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends
    and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the
    decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated,
    monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more
    intensive. We meet with individuals within and outside of the
    company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In
    addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor
    the flow of funds.

Factors
    affecting liquidity

Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and
    indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a
    downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency.
    Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could
    impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or
    war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or
    bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund.
    Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking
    industry in general may adversely affect the cost and
    availability of normal funding sources.



On November 1, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency
    that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, announced the
    downgrade of ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks,
    including KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from
    systemic support. KeyBank’s short-term borrowings, senior
    long-term debt and subordinated debt ratings received a one
    notch downgrade from

P-1

to P 2,
    A2 to A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively.

The new ratings have breached minimum thresholds established by
    Moody’s in connection with the securitizations that Key
    services, and impact the ability of KeyBank to hold certain
    escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage
    securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s. These
    escrow deposit balances range from $1.50 to $1.85 billion.
    Since the downgrade, KeyBank has been in discussions with
    Moody’s regarding an alternative investment vehicle for
    these funds that would be acceptable to Moody’s and
    maintain the funds at KeyBank. Subsequent to Moody’s
    announcement that was publicly issued on January 19, 2011,
    Moody’s indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits
    associated with our mortgage servicing operations will be
    required to be moved to another financial institution which
    meets the minimum ratings threshold within the first quarter of
    2011. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, KeyBank has
    determined that moving these escrow deposit balances results in
    an immaterial impairment of these mortgage servicing assets.
    KeyBank has ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these
    deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position.

Managing
    liquidity risk

We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our
    capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort
    to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable
    funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly
    hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and
    KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may
    conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more
    frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more
    strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion
    stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various
    funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they estimate
    the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would
    have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund
    our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these
    assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of
    liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project
    how funding needs would be managed.

We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future
    reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset
    portfolio. During the third quarter of 2009, our secured
    borrowings matured and were not replaced, though we retain the
    capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding
    source.

We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process
    for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an
    evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions.
    It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for
    effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part
    of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in
    our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could
    reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The
    portfolio at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.7 billion.
    The liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of
    $9.1 billion of unpledged securities, $2.2 billion of
    securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home
    Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $362 million of net balances of
    federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account.
    Additionally, as of December 31, 2010, our unused borrowing
    capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.3 billion at
    the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $1.8 billion at
    the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Long-term
    liquidity strategy

Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded
    with reduced reliance on wholesale funding. Key Community Bank
    supports our client insight-driven relationship strategy, with
    the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit-based
    funding to reduce our liquidity risk. We use the loan to deposit
    ratio as a metric to monitor this strategy. Our target loan to
    deposit ratio is between

90-100%,

which we calculate as total loans, loans

held-for-sale,

and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic
    deposits.

Sources
    of liquidity

Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits,
    wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows
    needed to support operating and investing activities are not
    satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or
    liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating,
    investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay
    outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage
    liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including
    short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.

Liquidity
    programs

We have several wholesale funding programs, which are described
    in Note 14 (“Short-Term Borrowings”), which
    enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the
    public and private markets when the capital markets are
    functioning



normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used
    for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of
    the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no
    restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.

Liquidity
    for KeyCorp

The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service
    its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities
    (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of
    subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties
    at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse
    consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.

Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the
    net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund
    debt maturing in twenty-four months or less with existing liquid
    assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the
    “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference
    between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial
    obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon
    the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within
    targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.

Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements
    through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law
    limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make
    to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A
    national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by
    several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute)
    for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up
    to the date of dividend declaration. During 2010, KeyBank did
    not pay any dividends to the parent; however, nonbank
    subsidiaries paid the parent $25 million in dividends. As
    of the close of business on December 31, 2010, KeyBank
    would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent
    without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence
    of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of
    long-term debt and stock. During 2010, the parent made capital
    infusions of $100 million to KeyBank, compared to
    $1.2 billion during 2009.

The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term
    investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt
    maturities over the next twenty-four months. At
    December 31, 2010, the parent company held
    $3.3 billion in short-term investments, which we projected
    to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.

During 2010, the parent company issued $750 million of a
    five-year medium-term fixed-rate senior note. We believe that
    this successful issuance demonstrates our ability to access the
    wholesale funding markets without an FDIC guarantee. Additional
    cash flow at the parent included $602 million of maturing
    debt, $286 million of interest and dividend payments, and
    various other cash flows netting to a $24 million outflow.

Our
    liquidity position and recent activity

Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset
    portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments,
    as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as
    protection against a range of potential liquidity stress
    scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access
    to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws
    on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.

From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank,
    may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt,
    capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase,
    privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such
    transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our
    liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and
    other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and
    financing activities. During 2010, we used the proceeds from
    loan paydowns and maturities of short-term investments to
    increase the balance of our securities

available-for-sale

portfolio. During 2009, the issuance of Common Shares was used
    to fund the reduction of short-term borrowings and long-term
    debt and to increase the balance of our securities

available-for-sale

portfolio.

The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources
    and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Credit
    ratings

Our credit ratings at December 31, 2010 are shown in Figure
    35. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal
    conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent
    company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to
    investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially
    improved relative to the disruption experienced between the
    third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009; however,
    the availability of credit is limited and the cost of funds is
    higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption.

Figure 35 reflects the credit ratings of KeyCorp securities at
    December 31, 2010. If our credit ratings fall below
    investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse
    effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to
    liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds,
    trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and
    decrease the number of



investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately,
    credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business
    operations and reduce our ability to generate income.

On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency
    that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that,
    if enacted into law, the financial reform bill then proposed by
    Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit
    ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank,
    because the legislation could weaken Moody’s assumptions
    regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial
    institutions. Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp
    holding company ratings did not benefit from any uplift as a
    result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. KeyBank
    long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as
    receiving a one notch “uplift” due to systemic support.

Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s announced its
    review for possible downgrade of the ratings of the ten large
    U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank. According to
    Moody’s, the ratings reviewed benefited from an expectation
    of increased government support since 2009. Moody’s review
    considered its government support assumptions in light of the
    recent passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. KeyBank long-term deposit,
    short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated
    long-term debt ratings were previously identified among the
    ratings under review for possible downgrade.

On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced the downgrade
    of KeyBank’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt
    and subordinated debt one notch from

P-1

to

P-2,

A2 to
    A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. In conjunction with the
    ratings changes, Moody’s upgraded their ratings outlook on
    the ratings from “negative” to “stable.”
    Subsequent to Moody’s announcement that was publicly issued
    January 19, 2011, Moody’s indicated to KeyBank that
    certain escrow deposits related to our mortgage servicing
    operations will be required to be moved to another financial
    institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the
    first quarter of 2011. For information on the impact that
    Moody’s action has had, see Note 9 (“Mortgage
    Servicing Assets”).

Credit
    risk management

Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an
    obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment
    or performance terms. Like other financial services
    institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities
    and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have
    related credit risk.

Credit policy, approval and evaluation

We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program.
    Risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit
    policies. These policies are communicated throughout the
    organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.

Our credit risk management is responsible for credit approval,
    is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior
    officers who have extensive experience in structuring and
    approving loans. Only credit risk management is authorized to
    grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not
    unusual to make exceptions to established policies when
    mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units
    have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a
    manageable level.

Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by
    credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter.
    Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or
    scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with
    quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned
    two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the
    probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the
    second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit
    facility. Default probability is determined based on, among
    other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an
    assessment of the borrower’s management, the
    borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector
    and our view of industry risk within the context of the general
    economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and
    collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected
    recovery assessment.



Credit risk management uses risk models to evaluate consumer
    loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the
    probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant.
    The scorecards are embedded in the application processing
    system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated
    decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the
    loan grading and scoring processes.

We maintain an active concentration management program to
    encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For
    individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure,
    known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the
    borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately
    $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal
    hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to
    approximately 25% of that amount. As of December 31, 2010,
    we had two client relationships with loan commitments of more
    than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these
    two individual obligor commitments was $94 million at
    December 31, 2010. In general, our philosophy is to
    maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.

We manage industry concentrations using several methods. On
    smaller portfolios, we may set limits based on a percentage of
    our total loan portfolio. On larger or higher risk portfolios,
    we may establish a specific dollar commitment level or a maximum
    level of economic capital.

In addition to these precautions discussed above, we actively
    manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with
    asset quality objectives, including the use of credit
    derivatives — primarily credit default
    swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps
    enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated
    with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At
    December 31, 2010, we used credit default swaps with a
    notional amount of $985 million to manage the credit risk
    associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also
    sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit
    default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio
    concentration and correlation risks. At December 31, 2010,
    the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the
    purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was
    $431 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit
    protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default
    swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee
    income.

Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair
    value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or
    received for credit protection, are included in the trading
    income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased
    our operating results by $23 million for 2010 compared to a
    decrease of $37 million last year.

We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk
    purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan
    portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.

Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five
    years are presented in Figure 36. The factors that drive these
    statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.

Watch and
    criticized assets

Watch assets

are troubled commercial loans with
    the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s
    current financial condition and possible inability to perform in
    accordance with the terms of the underlying contract.

Criticized assets

are troubled loans and other
    assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or
    have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from
    primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment
    from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation.
    Criticized assets showed significant improvement during 2010
    from one year ago.



Allowance
    for loan and lease losses

At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan and lease
    losses was $1.6 billion, or 3.20% of loans, compared to
    $2.5 billion, or 4.31%, at December 31, 2009. The
    allowance includes $58 million that was specifically
    allocated for impaired loans of $621 million at
    December 31, 2010, compared to $300 million that was
    allocated for impaired loans of $1.6 billion one year ago.
    For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5
    (“Asset Quality”). At December 31, 2010, the
    allowance for loan and lease losses was 150.19% of nonperforming
    loans, compared to 115.87% at December 31, 2009.

We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and
    lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used
    is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for
    Loan and Lease Losses.” Briefly, we apply historical loss
    rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and
    exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as
    changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or
    underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk
    associated with specific industries and markets. For all TDRs,
    regardless of size, as well as impaired loans having an
    outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct
    further analysis to determine the probable loss content and
    assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A
    specific allowance also may be assigned — even when
    sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain
    uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The
    allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2010
    represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan
    portfolio at that date.

As shown in Figure 37, our allowance for loan and lease losses
    decreased by $930 million, or 37%, during the past twelve
    months. In general, this decrease is attributed to an improved
    economic outlook, more favorable conditions in the capital
    markets, improvement in client income statements, and continued
    run off in the exit loan portfolio. More specifically, this
    contraction was associated with favorable risk rating migration
    experienced in the loan portfolio throughout the year, coupled
    with a decline in loans outstanding and a reduction in our
    general allowance, which encompasses the application of
    historical loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk
    characteristics and assessment of factors such as changes in
    economic condition and changes in credit policies or
    underwriting standards.

Both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank showed a decline
    in their level of allowance during 2010. The largest declines
    occurred in the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking
    Services and National Leasing lines of business. These lines of
    business experienced the most significant improvement in the
    underlying credit metrics which determine the allowance. Our
    delinquency trends continued to decline during 2010.

Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments
    decreased since 2009 by $48 million to $73 million at
    December 31, 2010. When combined with our allowance for
    loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses
    represented 3.35% of loans at the end of 2010 compared to 4.52%
    at the end of 2009.

Excludes allocations of the
    allowance for loan and lease losses in the amount of
    $114 million at December 31, 2010, $157 million
    at December 31, 2009, $174 million at
    December 31, 2008, $5 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, related to the discontinued operations of the
    education lending business.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was $638 million
    for 2010, compared to $3.2 billion for 2009. Our net loan
    charge-offs for 2010 exceeded the provision for loan and lease
    losses by $932 million. The decrease in our provision is
    due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most
    of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan
    balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans
    through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk
    businesses including the residential properties portion of our
    construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other
    selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans,
    payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. As these outstanding
    loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for
    loan and lease losses and corresponding provision.



Net loan
    charge-offs

Net loan charge-offs for 2010 totaled $1.6 billion, or
    2.91% of average loans from continuing operations. These results
    compare to net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, or 3.40%, for
    the same period last year. Figure 38 shows the trend in our net
    loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan
    charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in
    Figure 39.

Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial
    loan portfolio decreased by $673 million, due primarily to
    commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate
    Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net
    charge-offs for this line of business decreased
    $361 million from 2009, and included $131 million of
    net charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships
    during the fourth quarter of 2009. As shown in Figure 41, our
    exit loan portfolio accounted for $453 million, or 29%, of
    total net loan charge-offs for 2010.

Figure 40 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets.
    These assets totaled $1.3 billion at December 31,
    2010, and represented 2.66% of portfolio loans, OREO and other
    nonperforming assets, compared to $2.5 billion, or 4.25%,
    at December 31, 2009. See Note 1 under the headings
    “Impaired and Other Nonaccrual Loans” and
    “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” for a summary of
    our nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

As shown in Figure 40, nonperforming assets decreased during
    2010, having declined for the past four consecutive quarters.
    Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in
    the Commercial Real Estate line of business. As shown in Figure
    41, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $210 million, or
    16%, of total nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010,
    compared to $599 million, or 24%, in 2009.

At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial
    nonperforming loans outstanding represented 60% of their
    original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding
    represented 66% of their face value. At the same date, OREO



represented 52% of its original face value, while loans held for
    sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented
    47% of their face value.

At December 31, 2010, our 20 largest nonperforming loans
    totaled $306 million, representing 29% of total loans on
    nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared to
    $582 million representing 26%, respectively in the prior
    year.

Figure 41 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the net charge-offs recorded on
    this portfolio, and the nonperforming status of these loans at
    these dates. The exit loan portfolio represented 11% of total
    loans and loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 as
    compared to 13% at December 31, 2009.

Figure 42 shows credit exposure by industry classification in
    the largest sector of our loan portfolio, “commercial,
    financial and agricultural loans.” Since December 31,
    2009, total commitments and loans outstanding in this sector
    have decreased by $5.7 billion and $2.8 billion,
    respectively.

The types of activity that caused the change in our
    nonperforming loans during 2010 and 2009 are summarized in
    Figure 43. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans declined
    as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fourth
    consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on
    nonperforming loans increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, as
    market liquidity improved.

Factors that contributed to the change in our OREO during 2010
    and 2009 are summarized in Figure 45. As shown in this figure,
    the decrease in 2010 was attributable to properties acquired
    through foreclosure or voluntary transfer from the borrower.

Operational
    risk management

Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which
    is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance,
    inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
    external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
    (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or
    noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed
    practices or ethical standards and contractual obligations. Due
    to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies
    like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and
    regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened
    level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have
    created and continue to create work teams to respond to and
    analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that
    will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the
    Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit
    charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or
    forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk
    through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of
    business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, a system
    of internal controls and reporting.

We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal
    controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations,
    and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For
    example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and
    sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism
    helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take
    corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed
    to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring
    our control processes. This technology has enhanced the
    reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior
    management and the Board of Directors.

Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal
    control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines
    of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages
    the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the
    framework for the structure, governance, roles and
    responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational
    risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior
    management committee, oversees our level of operational risk,
    and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and
    related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk
    Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our
    Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall
    effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our
    system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of
    reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management
    and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit
    Committee’s oversight of these controls.

Fourth
    Quarter Results

Our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is
    summarized in Figure 46. Highlights of our results for the
    fourth quarter of 2010 are summarized below.

Earnings

We had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations
    attributable to Key common shareholders of $292 million, or
    $.33 per Common Share, compared to a net loss from continuing
    operations attributable to Key common shareholders of
    $258 million, or $.30 per Common Share, for the fourth
    quarter of 2009.

The fourth quarter 2010 results reflect an improvement in
    pre-provision net revenue and lower credit costs from the same
    period one-year ago. The fourth quarter 2009 results were
    negatively impacted by a $756 million loan and lease loss
    provision. Fourth quarter 2010 net income attributable to
    Key common shareholders was $279 million compared to a net
    loss attributable to Key common shareholders of
    $265 million for the same quarter one year ago.

On an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from
    continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 1.53%,
    compared to (.94)% for the fourth quarter of 2009. The
    annualized return on average common equity from continuing
    operations was 13.71% for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared
    to (12.60)% for the year-ago quarter.



Net
    interest income

Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $635 million
    for the fourth quarter of 2010, and the net interest margin was
    3.31%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest
    income of $637 million and a net interest margin of 3.04%
    for the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in the net interest
    margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We
    continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by
    reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and
    growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the
    net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of
    average earning assets compared to the same period one year ago
    resulting from pay downs on loans.

Noninterest
    income

Our noninterest income was $526 million for the fourth
    quarter of 2010, compared to $469 million for the year-ago
    quarter. Investment banking and capital markets income increased
    $110 million compared to the same period one year ago. In
    the fourth quarter of 2009, we incurred losses on certain real
    estate investments, recorded additional reserves on customer
    derivative positions, and recorded a loss on certain commercial
    mortgage-backed securities. In total, these amounted to a
    reduction of fee income of $87 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. This compares to income of $18 million
    recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of improved
    credit quality. In addition, net gains from loan sales increased
    $34 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, and a gain of
    $28 million was realized from the sale of Tuition
    Management Systems in the fourth quarter of 2010. These gains
    were partially offset by decreases of $86 million in net
    gains (losses) from principal investing (including results
    attributable to noncontrolling interests), $12 million in
    service charges on deposit accounts, and $10 million in
    operating lease income from the fourth quarter of 2009.

Noninterest
    expense

Our noninterest expense was $744 million for the fourth
    quarter of 2010, compared to $871 million for the same
    period last year. We recorded a credit of $26 million to
    the provision for losses on lending-related commitments during
    the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a charge to the
    provision of $27 million in the year-ago quarter. Also
    contributing to the decrease in noninterest expense was a
    decline in employee benefits expense of $41 million as a
    result of lower pension expense and medical claims expense.
    Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010, operating lease
    expense was $22 million less and OREO expense was
    $15 million less than the year-ago quarter.

Provision
    for loan and lease losses

Our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of
    $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a
    charge of $756 million for the year-ago quarter. Our
    allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.6 billion, or
    3.20% of total period-end loans, at December 31, 2010,
    compared to 4.31% at December 31, 2009.

Net loan charge-offs for the quarter totaled $256 million,
    or 2.00%, of average loans. These results compare to
    $708 million, or 4.64%, for the same period last year and
    $357 million, or 2.69%, for the previous quarter. Net loan
    charge-offs declined each quarter during 2010 and are at their
    lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Our exit loan
    portfolio accounted for $81 million, or 32%, of total net
    loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Income
    taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a tax provision of
    $172 million, compared to a benefit of $274 for the fourth
    quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter
    of 2010 was 33.7% compared with a 41.4% for the same quarter one
    year prior. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded
    domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as the
    result of our change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting
    in non-US subsidiaries. The tax benefit recorded during the
    fourth quarter of 2009 was primarily a result of a pre-tax loss
    from continuing operations.

(a)

In September 2009, we made the
    decision to discontinue the education lending business conducted
    through Key Education Resources, the education payment and
    financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we made the decision
    to curtail the operations of Austin, an investment subsidiary
    that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its
    institutional customer base. As a result of these decisions, we
    have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

We are responsible for the preparation, content and integrity of
    the financial statements and other statistical data and analyses
    compiled for this annual report. The financial statements and
    related notes have been prepared in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect
    our best estimates and judgments. We believe the financial
    statements and notes present fairly our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows in all material respects.

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of
    internal control that is designed to protect our assets and the
    integrity of our financial reporting. This corporate-wide system
    of controls includes self-monitoring mechanisms and written
    policies and procedures, prescribes proper delegation of
    authority and division of responsibility, and facilitates the
    selection and training of qualified personnel.

All employees are required to comply with our code of ethics. We
    conduct an annual certification process to ensure that our
    employees meet this obligation. Although any system of internal
    control can be compromised by human error or intentional
    circumvention of required procedures, we believe our system
    provides reasonable assurance that financial transactions are
    recorded and reported properly, providing an adequate basis for
    reliable financial statements.

The Board of Directors discharges its responsibility for our
    financial statements through its Audit Committee. This
    committee, which draws its members exclusively from the outside
    directors, also hires the independent registered public
    accounting firm.

Management’s
    Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
    internal control over our financial reporting. We have assessed
    the effectiveness of our internal control and procedures over
    financial reporting using criteria described in “Internal
    Control – Integrated Framework,” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on that assessment, we believe we maintained
    an effective system of internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010. Our independent registered public
    accounting firm has issued an attestation report, dated
    February 24, 2011, on our internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included in this annual report.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Shareholders and Board of Directors

KeyCorp

We have audited KeyCorp’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
    criteria”). KeyCorp’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, KeyCorp maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    the consolidated balance sheets of KeyCorp as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each
    of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010,
    and our report dated February 24, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of

Shareholders and Board of Directors

KeyCorp

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    KeyCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of KeyCorp’s management. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of KeyCorp and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Organization

We are one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial
    services companies, with consolidated total assets of
    $91.8 billion at December 31, 2010. Through KeyBank
    and other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and
    commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management,
    consumer finance, and investment banking products and services
    to individual, corporate and institutional clients. As of
    December 31, 2010, KeyBank operated 1,033 full service
    retail banking branches in 14 states, a telephone banking
    call center services group and 1,531 automated teller machines
    in 15 states. Additional information pertaining to Key
    Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank, our two business
    segments, is included in Note 21 (“Line of Business
    Results”).



Use of
    Estimates

Our accounting policies conform to GAAP and prevailing practices
    within the financial services industry. We must make certain
    estimates and judgments when determining the amounts presented
    in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
    If these estimates prove to be inaccurate, actual results could
    differ from those reported.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
    Some previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
    conform to current reporting practices.

The consolidated financial statements include any voting rights
    entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In
    accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for
    consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a
    variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct
    activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance; and (iii) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the
    primary beneficiary). Variable interests can include equity
    interests, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases,
    service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan
    commitments, and other contracts, agreements and financial
    instruments. See Note 11 (“Variable Interest
    Entities”) for information on our involvement with VIEs.

We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated
    investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have
    significant influence over the entity’s operating and
    financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic
    interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated
    investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a
    voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are
    carried at cost. Investments held by our registered
    broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (primarily
    principal investments) are carried at fair value.

Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted new
    accounting guidance that changes the way we account for
    securitizations and SPEs by eliminating the concept of a QSPE
    and changing the requirements for derecognition of financial
    assets. In adopting this guidance, we had to analyze our
    existing QSPEs for possible consolidation. As a result, we
    consolidated our education loan securitization trusts. That
    consolidation added $2.8 billion in discontinued assets,
    liabilities and equity to our balance sheet, of which
    $2.6 billion of the assets represented loans. Prior to
    January 1, 2010, QSPEs, including securitization trusts,
    established under the applicable accounting guidance for
    transfers of financial assets were not consolidated. For
    additional information related to the consolidation of our
    education loan securitization trusts, see the section entitled
    “Accounting Standards Adopted in 2010” in this note
    and Note 13 (“Acquisition, Divestiture and
    Discontinued Operations”).

All material events that occurred after the date of the
    financial statements and before the financial statements were
    issued have been either recognized in the financial statements
    or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Financial
    statements are considered issued when they are widely
    distributed to all shareholders and other financial statement
    users, or filed with the SEC.

Business
    Combinations

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition
    method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the
    acquired company’s net assets are recorded at fair value at
    the date of acquisition, and the results of operations of the
    acquired company are combined with Key’s results from that
    date forward. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. The
    difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the
    net assets acquired (including intangible assets with finite
    lives) is recorded as goodwill. Our accounting policy for
    intangible assets is summarized in this note under the heading
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Statements
    of Cash Flows

Cash and due from banks are considered “cash and cash
    equivalents” for financial reporting purposes.

Trading
    Account Assets

Trading account assets are debt and equity securities, as well
    as commercial loans that we purchase and hold but intend to sell
    in the near term. These assets are reported at fair value.
    Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading account
    assets are reported in “investment banking and capital
    markets income (loss)” on the income statement.

Securities

Securities available for sale.

These are
    securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of
    time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest
    rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs or other factors.
    Securities available for sale are reported



at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses (net of income taxes)
    deemed temporary are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI
    on the balance sheet. Unrealized losses on equity securities
    deemed to be

“other-than-temporary,”

and realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities
    using the specific identification method are included in
    “net securities gains (losses)” on the income
    statement. Unrealized losses on debt securities deemed to be

“other-than-temporary”

are included in “net securities gains (losses)” on the
    income statement or AOCI in accordance with the applicable
    accounting guidance related to the recognition of OTTI of debt
    securities, as further described under the heading

“Other-than-Temporary

Impairment” in this Note and in Note 7
    (“Securities”).

“Other securities” held in the

available-for-sale

portfolio are primarily marketable equity securities that are
    traded on a public exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ.

Held-to-maturity

securities.

These are debt securities that we have
    the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Debt securities
    are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums
    and accretion of discounts using the interest method. This
    method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted
    carrying amount.

“Other securities” held in the

held-to-maturity

portfolio consist of foreign bonds, capital securities and
    preferred equity securities.

Other-than-Temporary

Impairments

If the amortized cost of a debt security is greater than its
    fair value and we intend to sell it, or more-likely-than-not
    will be required to sell it, before the expected recovery of the
    amortized cost, then the entire impairment is recognized in
    earnings. If we have no intent to sell the security, or it is
    more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell it,
    before expected recovery, then the credit portion of the
    impairment is recognized in earnings, while the remaining
    portion attributable to factors such as liquidity and interest
    rate changes is recognized in equity as a component of AOCI on
    the balance sheet. The credit portion is equal to the difference
    between the cash flows expected to be collected and the
    amortized cost of the debt security.

Generally, if the amortized cost of an equity security is
    greater than its fair value, the difference is considered to be

other-than-temporary.

Other
    Investments

Principal investments — investments in equity and
    mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing
    unit — represented 66% and 70% of other investments at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. They include
    direct investments (investments made in a particular company),
    as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds
    that include other investors). Principal investments
    predominantly are made in privately-held companies and are
    carried at fair value ($898 million at December 31,
    2010, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009). Changes
    in fair values and realized gains and losses on sales of
    principal investments are reported as “net gains (losses)
    from principal investing” on the income statement.

In addition to principal investments, “other
    investments” include other equity and mezzanine
    instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments
    that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of
    investments that generally are carried at cost. The carrying
    amounts of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for
    declines in value if they are considered to be

other-than-temporary.

These adjustments are included in “investment banking and
    capital markets income (loss)” on the income statement.

Loans

Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of
    unearned income, including net deferred loan fees and costs. We
    defer certain nonrefundable loan origination and commitment
    fees, and the direct costs of originating or acquiring loans.
    The net deferred amount is amortized over the estimated lives of
    the related loans as an adjustment to the yield.

Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of the
    lease receivable plus estimated unguaranteed residual values,
    less unearned income and deferred initial direct fees and costs.
    Unearned income on direct financing leases is amortized over the
    lease terms using a method approximating the interest method
    that produces a constant rate of return on the leases. Deferred
    initial direct fees and costs are amortized over the lease terms
    as an adjustment to the yield.

Leveraged leases are carried net of nonrecourse debt. Revenue on
    leveraged leases is recognized on a basis that produces a
    constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the
    leases, net of related deferred tax liabilities, during the
    years in which the net investment is positive.

The residual value component of a lease represents the fair
    value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. We rely
    on industry data, historical experience, independent appraisals
    and the experience of the equipment leasing asset management
    team to value lease residuals. Relationships with a number of
    equipment vendors give the asset management team insight into
    the life cycle of the leased equipment, pending product upgrades
    and competing products.



In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for leases,
    residual values are reviewed at least annually to determine if
    an

other-than-temporary

decline in value has occurred. If such a decline occurs, the
    residual value is adjusted to its fair value. Impairment charges
    are included in noninterest expense while, net gains or losses
    on sales of lease residuals, are included in “other
    income” on the income statement.

Loans
    Held for Sale

Our loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are
    disclosed in Note 4 (“Loans and Loans Held for
    Sale”). These loans, which we originated and intend to
    sell, are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value.
    Fair value is determined based on available market data for
    similar assets, expected cash flows, appraisals of underlying
    collateral and credit quality of the borrower. If a loan is
    transferred from the loan portfolio to the

held-for-sale

category, any write-down in the carrying amount of the loan at
    the date of transfer is recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent
    declines in fair value are recognized as a charge to noninterest
    income. When a loan is placed in the

held-for-sale

category, we stop amortizing the related deferred fees and
    costs. The remaining unamortized fees and costs are recognized
    as part of the cost basis of the loan at the time it is sold.

Impaired
    and Other Nonaccrual Loans

We generally will stop accruing interest on a loan (i.e.,
    designate the loan “nonaccrual”) when the
    borrower’s payment is 90 days past due for a
    commercial loan or 120 days past due for a consumer loan,
    unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of
    collection. Loans also are placed on nonaccrual status when
    payment is not past due but we have serious doubts about the
    borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms.
    Once a loan is designated nonaccrual, the interest accrued but
    not collected generally is charged against the allowance for
    loan and lease losses, and payments subsequently received
    generally are applied to principal. However, if we believe that
    all principal and interest on a nonaccrual loan ultimately are
    collectible, interest income may be recognized as received.

Nonaccrual loans, other than smaller-balance homogeneous loans
    (i.e., home equity loans, loans to finance automobiles, etc.),
    are designated “impaired.” Impaired loans and other
    nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status if we determine
    that both principal and interest are collectible. This generally
    requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest
    payments.

Allowance
    for Loan and Lease Losses

The allowance for loan and lease losses represents our estimate
    of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the
    balance sheet date. We establish the amount of the allowance for
    loan and lease losses by analyzing the quality of the loan
    portfolio at least quarterly, and more often if deemed necessary.

We estimate the appropriate level of our allowance for loan and
    lease losses by applying historical loss rates to existing loans
    with similar risk characteristics. The loss rates used to
    establish the allowance may be adjusted to reflect our current
    assessment of many factors, including:

♦

changes in national and local economic and business conditions;

♦

changes in the experience, ability and depth of our lending
    management and staff, in lending policies, or in the mix and
    volume of the loan portfolio;

♦

trends in past due, nonaccrual and other loans; and

♦

external forces, such as competition, legal developments and
    regulatory guidelines.

For all TDR’s, regardless of size as well as, impaired loan
    has an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we
    conduct further analysis to determine the probable amount of
    loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan, if deemed
    appropriate. We estimate the extent of impairment by comparing
    the carrying amount of the loan with the estimated present value
    of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying
    collateral or the loan’s observable market price. We may
    assign a specific allowance — even when sources of
    repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain
    about whether the loan will be repaid in full.

Commercial loans generally are charged off in full or charged
    down to the fair value of the underlying collateral when the
    borrower’s payment is 180 days past due. Our
    charge-off policy for most consumer loans is similar but takes
    effect when payments are 120 days past due. Home equity and
    residential mortgage loans generally are charged down to the
    fair value of the underlying collateral when payment is
    180 days past due.

Liability
    for Credit Losses on Lending-Related Commitments

The liability for credit losses inherent in lending-related
    commitments, such as letters of credit and unfunded loan
    commitments, is included in “accrued expense and other
    liabilities” on the balance sheet and totaled
    $73 million at December 31, 2010, and



$121 million at December 31, 2009. We establish the
    amount of this allowance by considering both historical trends
    and current market conditions quarterly, or more often if deemed
    necessary.

Loan
    Securitizations

In the past, we securitized education loans when market
    conditions were favorable. A securitization involves the sale of
    a pool of loan receivables to investors through either a public
    or private issuance (generally by a QSPE) of

asset-backed

securities. The securitized loans are removed from the balance
    sheet, and a gain or loss is recorded when the combined net
    sales proceeds and residual interests, if any, differ from the
    loans’ allocated carrying amounts. We have not securitized
    any education loans since 2006. Effective December 5, 2009,
    we ceased originating education loans.

Effective January 1, 2010, we prospectively adopted new
    accounting guidance that changes the way we account for
    securitizations and SPEs by eliminating the concept of a QSPE
    and changing the requirements for derecognition of financial
    assets. In adopting this guidance, we had to analyze our
    existing QSPEs for possible consolidation. As a result, we
    consolidated our education loan securitization trusts. That
    consolidation added $2.8 billion in discontinued assets,
    liabilities and equity to our balance sheet of which
    $2.6 billion of the assets represented loans. Prior to
    January 1, 2010, QSPEs, including securitization trusts,
    established under the applicable accounting guidance for
    transfers of financial assets were not consolidated. For
    additional information related to the consolidation of our
    education loan securitization trusts, see the section entitled
    “Accounting Standards Adopted in 2010” in this Note
    and Note 13 (“Acquisition, Divestiture and
    Discontinued Operations”).

In past securitizations, we generally retained an interest in
    the securitized loans in the form of an interest-only strip,
    residual asset, servicing asset or security. A servicing asset
    was recorded if we purchased or retained the right to service
    securitized loans, and received servicing fees that exceeded the
    going market rate. Our accounting for servicing assets is
    discussed below under the heading “Servicing Assets.”
    All other retained interests from education loan securitizations
    held by us on or before December 31, 2009, were accounted
    for as debt securities and have been classified as
    “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet.

Servicing
    Assets

Servicing assets and liabilities purchased or retained initially
    are measured at fair value, if practical. When no ready market
    value (such as quoted market prices, or prices based on sales or
    purchases of similar assets) is available to determine the fair
    value of servicing assets, fair value is determined by
    calculating the present value of future cash flows associated
    with servicing the loans. This calculation is based on a number
    of assumptions, including the market cost of servicing, the
    discount rate, the prepayment rate and the default rate.

We remeasure our servicing assets using the amortization method
    at each reporting date. The amortization of servicing assets is
    determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the
    estimated net servicing income, and is recorded in “other
    income” on the income statement.

We service commercial real estate loans. Servicing assets
    related to all commercial real estate loan servicing totaled
    $196 million at December 31, 2010, and
    $221 million at December 31, 2009, and are included in
    “accrued income and other assets” on the balance sheet.

Servicing assets are evaluated quarterly for possible
    impairment. This process involves classifying the assets based
    on the types of loans serviced and their associated interest
    rates, and determining the fair value of each class. If the
    evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the servicing
    assets exceeds their fair value, the carrying amount is reduced
    through a charge to income in the amount of such excess. There
    was no servicing impairment for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Additional information
    pertaining to servicing assets is included in Note 9
    (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).

Premises
    and Equipment

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are
    stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    We determine depreciation of premises and equipment using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    particular assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using
    the straight-line method over the terms of the leases.
    Accumulated depreciation and amortization on premises and
    equipment totaled $1 billion at December 31, 2010, and
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets
    acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value.
    Other intangible assets primarily are the net present value of
    future economic benefits to be derived from the purchase of core
    deposits. Other intangible assets are amortized on either an
    accelerated or straight-line basis over periods ranging from
    three to thirty years. Goodwill and other types of intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.



Relevant accounting guidance provides that goodwill and certain
    other intangible assets must be subjected to impairment testing
    at least annually. We perform goodwill impairment testing in the
    fourth quarter of each year. Our reporting units for purposes of
    this testing are our two business segments, Key Community Bank
    and Key Corporate Bank. Because the strength of the economic
    recovery remained uncertain during 2010, we continued to monitor
    the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible
    assets, and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets as
    necessary.

The first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine
    the fair value of each reporting unit. This amount is estimated
    using comparable external market data (market approach) and
    discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate
    risk premium and earnings forecast information (income
    approach). We perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated
    fair value of each reporting unit, as appropriate. If the
    carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
    goodwill impairment may be indicated. In such a case, we would
    estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit
    (representing the unit’s fair value) and then compare that
    hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the
    unit’s net assets (excluding goodwill). Any excess of the
    estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting
    unit’s net assets represents the implied fair value of
    goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the
    impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to
    earnings.

Additional information pertaining to goodwill and other
    intangible assets is included in Note 10 (“Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets”).

Internally
    Developed Software

We rely on company personnel and independent contractors to
    plan, develop, install, customize and enhance computer systems
    applications that support corporate and administrative
    operations. Software development costs, such as those related to
    program coding, testing, configuration and installation, are
    capitalized and included in “accrued income and other
    assets” on the balance sheet. The resulting asset
    ($52 million at December 31, 2010, and
    $85 million at December 31, 2009) is amortized
    using the straight-line method over its expected useful life
    (not to exceed five years). Costs incurred during the planning
    and post-development phases of an internal software project are
    expensed as incurred.

Software that is no longer used is written off to earnings
    immediately. When we decide to replace software, amortization of
    the phased-out software is accelerated to the expected
    replacement date.

Derivatives

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance for
    derivatives and hedging, all derivatives are recognized as
    either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.

Accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of
    derivatives differs depending on whether the derivative has been
    designated and qualifies as part of a hedge relationship, and
    further, on the type of hedge relationship. For derivatives that
    are not designated as hedging instruments, any gain or loss is
    recognized immediately in earnings. A derivative that is
    designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument must be
    designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge
    of a net investment in a foreign operation. We do not have any
    derivatives that hedge net investments in foreign operations.

A fair value hedge is used to limit exposure to changes in the
    fair value of existing assets, liabilities and commitments
    caused by changes in interest rates or other economic factors.
    The effective portion of a change in the fair value of a fair
    value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time as a change
    in fair value of the hedged item, resulting in no effect on net
    income. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of
    such a hedging instrument is recognized in “other
    income” on the income statement, with no corresponding
    offset.

A cash flow hedge is used to minimize the variability of future
    cash flows that is caused by changes in interest rates or other
    economic factors. The effective portion of a gain or loss on a
    cash flow hedge is recorded as a component of AOCI on the
    balance sheet, and reclassified to earnings in the same period
    in which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. The
    ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is included in
    “other income” on the income statement.

Hedge “effectiveness” is determined by the extent to
    which changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument
    offset changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to
    the risk being hedged. If the relationship between the change in
    the fair value of the derivative instrument and the change in
    the hedged item falls within a range considered to be the
    industry norm, the hedge is considered “highly
    effective” and qualifies for hedge accounting. A hedge is
    “ineffective” if the relationship between the changes
    falls outside the acceptable range. In that case, hedge
    accounting is discontinued on a prospective basis. Hedge
    effectiveness is tested at least quarterly.

Additional information regarding the accounting for derivatives
    is provided in Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging
    Activities”).



Offsetting
    Derivative Positions

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance related to
    the offsetting of certain derivative contracts on the balance
    sheet, we take into account the impact of bilateral collateral
    and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all
    derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net
    basis, and to offset the net derivative position with the
    related collateral when recognizing derivative assets and
    liabilities. Additional information regarding derivative
    offsetting is provided in Note 8.

Noncontrolling
    Interests

Our Principal Investing unit and the Real Estate Capital and
    Corporate Banking Services line of business have noncontrolling
    (minority) interests that are accounted for in accordance with
    the applicable accounting guidance, which allows us to report
    noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries as a component of
    equity on the balance sheet. “Net income (loss)” on
    the income statement includes Key’s revenues, expenses,
    gains and losses, together with revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests. The portion
    of net results attributable to the noncontrolling interests is
    disclosed separately on the face of the income statement to
    arrive at the “net income (loss) attributable to Key.”

Guarantees

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for
    guarantees, we recognize liabilities, which are included in
    “accrued expense and other liabilities” on the balance
    sheet, for the fair value of our obligations under certain
    guarantees issued.

If we receive a fee for a guarantee requiring liability
    recognition, the amount of the fee represents the initial fair
    value of the “stand ready” obligation. If there is no
    fee, the fair value of the stand ready obligation is determined
    using expected present value measurement techniques, unless
    observable transactions for comparable guarantees are available.
    The subsequent accounting for these stand ready obligations
    depends on the nature of the underlying guarantees. We account
    for our release from risk under a particular guarantee when the
    guarantee expires or is settled, or by a systematic and rational
    amortization method, depending on the risk profile of the
    guarantee.

Additional information regarding guarantees is included in
    Note 16 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and
    Guarantees”) under the heading “Guarantees.”

Fair
    Value Measurements

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the applicable
    accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures
    for all applicable financial and nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements, and applies only when other guidance
    requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair
    value; the guidance did not expand the use of fair value to any
    new circumstances.

Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an
    asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants in our principal market. In other words,
    fair value represents an exit price at the measurement date.
    Market participants are buyers and sellers who are independent,
    knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact in the principal
    (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability being
    measured. Current market conditions, including imbalances
    between supply and demand, are considered in determining fair
    value.

We value our assets and liabilities based on the principal
    market where each would be sold (in the case of assets) or
    transferred (in the case of liabilities). The principal market
    is the forum with the greatest volume and level of activity. In
    the absence of a principal market, valuation is based on the
    most advantageous market (i.e., the market where the asset could
    be sold at a price that maximizes the amount to be received or
    the liability transferred at a price that minimizes the amount
    to be paid). In the absence of observable market transactions,
    we consider liquidity valuation adjustments to reflect the
    uncertainty in pricing the instruments.

In measuring the fair value of an asset, we assume the highest
    and best use of the asset by a market participant—not just
    the intended use—to maximize the value of the asset. We
    also consider whether any credit valuation adjustments are
    necessary based on the counterparty’s credit quality.

When measuring the fair value of a liability, we assume that the
    transfer will not affect the nonperformance risk associated with
    the liability. Nonperformance risk is the risk that an
    obligation will not be satisfied, and encompasses not only our
    own credit risk (i.e., the risk that we will fail to meet our
    obligation), but also other risks such as settlement risk (i.e.,
    the risk that upon termination or sale, the contract will not
    settle). We consider the effect of our own credit risk on the
    fair value for any period in which fair value is measured.

There are three acceptable techniques for measuring fair value:
    the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach.
    Selecting the appropriate technique for valuing a particular
    asset or liability depends on the exit market, the nature of



the asset or liability being valued, and how a market
    participant would value the same asset or liability. Ultimately,
    selecting the appropriate valuation method requires significant
    judgment, and applying the valuation techniques requires
    sufficient knowledge and expertise.

Valuation inputs refer to the assumptions market participants
    would use in pricing a given asset or liability. Inputs can be
    observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are assumptions
    based on market data obtained from an independent source.
    Unobservable inputs are assumptions based on our own information
    or assessment of assumptions used by other market participants
    in pricing the asset or liability. Our unobservable inputs are
    based on the best and most current information available on the
    measurement date.

All inputs, whether observable or unobservable, are ranked in
    accordance with a prescribed fair value hierarchy that gives the
    highest ranking to quoted prices in active markets for identical
    assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking
    to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fair values for assets or
    liabilities classified as Level 2 are based on one or a
    combination of the following factors: (i) quoted market
    prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) observable
    inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or
    (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. The level in the fair value hierarchy
    ascribed to a fair value measurement in its entirety is based on
    the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement.
    We consider an input to be significant if it drives 10% or more
    of the total fair value of a particular asset or liability.
    Assets and liabilities may transfer between levels based on the
    observable and unobservable inputs used at the valuation date,
    as the inputs may be influenced by certain market conditions.

Typically, assets and liabilities are considered to be fair
    valued on a recurring basis if fair value is measured regularly.
    However, assets and liabilities are considered to be fair valued
    on a nonrecurring basis if the fair value measurement of the
    instrument does not necessarily result in a change in the amount
    recorded on the balance sheet. This generally occurs when the
    entity applies accounting guidance that requires assets and
    liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value,
    or assessed for impairment.

At a minimum, we conduct our valuations quarterly. Additional
    information regarding fair value measurements and disclosures is
    provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”).

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenues as they are earned based on contractual
    terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. Our principal source of
    revenue is interest income, which is recognized on an accrual
    basis primarily according to nondiscretionary formulas in
    written contracts, such as loan agreements or securities
    contracts.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured using the fair value method
    of accounting, and the measured cost is recognized over the
    period during which the recipient is required to provide service
    in exchange for the award. We estimate expected forfeitures when
    stock-based awards are granted and record compensation expense
    only for awards that are expected to vest.

We recognize compensation cost for stock-based, mandatory
    deferred incentive compensation awards using the accelerated
    method of amortization over a period of approximately four years
    (the current year performance period and a three-year vesting
    period, which generally starts in the first quarter following
    the performance period).

Employee stock options typically become exercisable at the rate
    of 33-1/3% per year beginning one year after their grant date
    and expire no later than ten years after their grant date. We
    recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options
    with graded vesting using an accelerated method of amortization.

We use shares repurchased under a repurchase program (treasury
    shares) for share issuances under all stock-based compensation
    programs other than the discounted stock purchase plan. Shares
    issued under the stock purchase plan are purchased on the open
    market.

We estimate the fair value of options granted using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model, as further described in
    Note 18 (“Stock-Based Compensation”).

Marketing
    Costs

We expense all marketing-related costs, including advertising
    costs, as incurred.

Accounting
    Guidance Adopted in 2010

Transfers of financial assets.

In June 2009,
    the FASB issued new accounting guidance that changes the way
    entities account for securitizations and SPEs by eliminating the
    concept of a QSPE and changing the requirements for
    derecognition of financial



assets. This guidance, which also requires additional
    disclosures, was effective at the start of an entity’s
    first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009
    (effective January 1, 2010, for us). Adoption of this
    guidance did not have a material effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Consolidation of variable interest
    entities.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new
    accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures and
    changes how a company determines when an entity that is
    insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting
    (or similar) rights should be consolidated. The determination of
    whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based
    on, among other things, the entity’s purpose and design and
    the company’s ability to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance.
    This guidance was effective at the start of a company’s
    first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009
    (effective January 1, 2010, for us).

In conjunction with our prospective adoption of this guidance on
    January 1, 2010, we consolidated our education loan
    securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and
    liabilities). That consolidation added $2.8 billion in
    assets, liabilities and equity to our balance sheet, of which
    $2.6 billion of the assets represented loans.

In February 2010, the FASB deferred the application of this new
    guidance for certain investment entities and clarified other
    aspects of the guidance. Entities qualifying for this deferral
    will continue to apply the previously existing consolidation
    guidance.

Improving disclosures about fair value
    measurements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued
    accounting guidance which requires new disclosures regarding
    certain aspects of an entity’s fair value disclosures and
    clarifies existing fair value disclosure requirements. The new
    disclosures and clarifications were effective for interim and
    annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009
    (effective January 1, 2010, for us), except for disclosures
    regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the
    rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements,
    which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning
    after December 15, 2010 (effective January 1, 2011,
    for us). Our policy is to recognize transfers between levels of
    the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period. The
    required disclosures are provided in Note 6 (“Fair
    Value Measurements”).

Credit quality disclosures.

In July 2010, the
    FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires additional
    disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables
    (i.e., loans) and the allowance for credit losses. Most of these
    additional disclosures are required for interim and annual
    reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010
    (effective December 31, 2010, for us). These disclosures
    are provided in Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).
    Specific items regarding activity that occurred before the
    issuance of this accounting guidance, such as the allowance
    rollforward disclosures, will be required for periods beginning
    after December 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011, for us). In
    January 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that
    temporarily delays the effective date of the credit quality
    disclosures about troubled debt restructurings until the FASB
    completes its deliberations on what constitutes a troubled debt
    restructuring.

Embedded credit derivatives.

In March 2010,
    the FASB issued new accounting guidance that amends and
    clarifies how entities should evaluate credit derivatives
    embedded in beneficial interests in securitized financial
    assets. This accounting guidance eliminates the existing scope
    exception for most credit derivative features embedded in
    beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. This
    guidance was effective the first day of the fiscal quarter
    beginning after June 15, 2010 (effective July 1, 2010,
    for us), with early adoption permitted. We have no financial
    instruments that would be subject to this accounting guidance.

Accounting
    Guidance Pending Adoption at December 31, 2010

There was no new accounting guidance pending adoption at
    December 31, 2010.

In September 2009, we decided to
    discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key
    Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of
    KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations
    of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund
    investments for institutional customers. As a result of these
    decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as
    discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily
    attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education
    lending securitization trusts. Included in the loss from
    discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2009, is a charge for intangible assets impairment related to
    Austin.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    weighted-average contingently issuable performance-based Common
    Share awards totaling 3,847,879, 4,536,173 and 1,177,881 Common
    Shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the
    calculations of “net income (loss) per common share
    attributable to Key common
    shareholders — assuming dilution.” These
    awards vest only if we achieve certain cumulative three-year
    financial performance targets and were not included in the
    respective calculations because the time period for the
    measurement had not yet expired.



3. Restrictions
    on Cash, Dividends and Lending Activities

Federal law requires a depository institution to maintain a
    prescribed amount of cash or deposit reserve balances with its
    Federal Reserve Bank. KeyBank maintained average reserve
    balances aggregating $208 million in 2010 to fulfill these
    requirements.

Capital distributions from KeyBank and other subsidiaries are
    our principal source of cash flows for paying dividends on our
    common and preferred shares, servicing our debt and financing
    corporate operations. Federal banking law limits the amount of
    capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding
    company without prior regulatory approval. A national
    bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several
    factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the
    two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the
    date of dividend declaration.

During 2010, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to KeyCorp;
    nonbank subsidiaries paid KeyCorp a total of $25 million in
    dividends. As of the close of business on December 31,
    2010, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to
    KeyCorp according to regulatory guidelines. For information
    related to the limitations on KeyCorp’s ability to pay
    dividends and repurchase Common Shares as a result of its
    participation in the U.S. Treasury’s CPP, see
    Note 15 (“Shareholders’ Equity”) on
    page 107 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. During
    2010, KeyCorp made capital infusions of $100 million to
    KeyBank. At December 31, 2010, KeyCorp held
    $3.3 billion in short-term investments, which can be used
    to pay dividends, service debt and finance corporate operations.

Federal law also restricts loans and advances from bank
    subsidiaries to their parent companies (and to nonbank
    subsidiaries of their parent companies), and requires those
    transactions to be secured.

We use interest rate swaps, which modify the repricing
    characteristics of certain loans, to manage interest rate risk.
    For more information about such swaps, see Note 8
    (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).

5. Asset
    Quality

We use the following three-step process to estimate the
    appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on
    at least a quarterly basis: (1) we apply historical loss
    rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics as
    noted in the credit quality indicator table below; (2) we
    exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as
    changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or
    underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk
    associated with specific industries and markets; and,
    (3) for all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired
    loans with an outstanding balance greater than
    $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the
    probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the
    loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be
    assigned — even when sources of repayment appear
    sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the
    loan will be repaid in full. Additional information is provided
    in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and
    Lease Losses.” The allowance for loan and lease losses at
    December 31, 2010, represents our best estimate of the
    losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.

While quantitative modeling factors such as default probability
    and expected recovery rates are constantly changing as the
    financial strength of the borrower and overall economic
    conditions change, there have been no changes to the accounting
    policies or methodology we used to estimate the allowance for
    loan and lease losses.

At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan and lease
    losses was $1.6 billion, or 3.20% of loans compared to
    $2.5 billion, or 4.31% of loans, at December 31, 2009.
    At December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan and lease
    losses was 150.19% of nonperforming loans compared to 115.87% at
    December 31, 2009.

The risk characteristic prevalent to both commercial and
    consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an
    obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment
    or performance terms. Evaluation of this risk is stratified and
    monitored by the assigned loan risk rating grades for the
    commercial loan portfolios and the regulatory risk ratings
    assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. This risk rating
    stratification assists in the determination of the allowance for
    loan and lease losses.

Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by
    credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter.
    Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or
    scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with
    quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned
    two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the
    probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the
    second reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility.
    Default



probability is determined based on, among other factors, the
    financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the
    borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive
    position within its industry sector and our view of industry
    risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types
    of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including
    credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.

Credit quality indicators for loans are updated quarterly. Bond
    rating classifications are indicative of the credit quality of
    our commercial loan portfolios and are determined by converting
    our internally assigned risk rating grades to bond rating
    categories. Payment activity and the regulatory classifications
    of pass, special mention and substandard, are indicators of the
    credit quality of our consumer loan portfolios.

Credit quality indicators for our commercial and consumer loan
    portfolios as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

Impaired loans totaled $.9 billion at December 31,
    2010, compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009.
    Impaired loans had an average balance of $1.3 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 and $1.7 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. Of total impaired loans,
    $621 million required a specifically allocated allowance at
    December 31, 2010. A total allowance of $58 million
    was specifically allocated to these loans. At December 31,
    2010, aggregate restructured loans (accrual, nonaccrual, and

held-for-sale

loans) totaled $297 million while at December 31, 2009
    total restructured loans totaled $364 million. Although we
    added $147 million in restructured loans during 2010, the
    overall decrease in restructured loans was primarily
    attributable to $214 million in payments and charge-offs.

At December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial
    nonperforming loans outstanding represented 60% of their
    original contractual amount, and total nonperforming loans
    outstanding represented 66% of their original contractual
    amount. At the same date, OREO represented 52% of its original
    contractual amount, while loans held for sale and other
    nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 47% of their
    face value.

At December 31, 2010, our twenty largest nonperforming
    loans totaled $306 million, representing 29% of total loans
    on nonperforming status from continuing operations as compared
    to $582 million in nonperforming loans representing 26% of
    total loans, in the prior year.

There were no loans acquired with
    deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2010.

Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by
    $930 million, or 37%, during the past twelve months. This
    contraction was associated with the improvement in credit
    quality of our loan portfolios, which has trended more favorably
    the past three quarters. Asset quality is improving and has
    resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in
    our general allowance which encompasses the application of
    historical loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk
    characteristics and an assessment of factors such as changes in
    economic conditions and changes in credit policies or
    underwriting standards. Our delinquency trends improved
    throughout 2010. We attribute this improvement to a moderate
    economic outlook, more favorable conditions in the capital
    markets, improvement in client income statements and continued
    run off in our exit loan portfolio.

    liabilities” on the balance sheet. We establish the amount
    of this allowance by considering both historical trends and
    current market conditions quarterly, or more often if deemed
    necessary. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related
    commitments decreased since 2009 by $48 million to
    $73 million at December 31, 2010. When combined with

6. Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair
    Value Determination

As defined in the applicable accounting guidance for fair value
    measurements and disclosures, fair value is the price to sell an
    asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants in our principal market. We have established
    and documented our process for determining the fair values of
    our assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is
    based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market
    prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and
    liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing
    services. Both of these approaches rely on market-based
    parameters, when available, such as interest rate yield curves,
    option volatilities and credit spreads, or unobservable inputs.
    Unobservable inputs may be based on our judgment, assumptions
    and estimates related to credit quality, liquidity, interest
    rates and other relevant inputs.

Valuation adjustments, such as those pertaining to counterparty
    and our own credit quality and liquidity, may be necessary to
    ensure that assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value.
    Credit valuation adjustments are made when market pricing is not
    indicative of the counterparty’s credit quality.

We make liquidity valuation adjustments to the fair value of
    certain assets to reflect the uncertainty in the pricing and
    trading of the instruments when we are unable to observe recent
    market transactions for identical or similar instruments.
    Liquidity valuation adjustments are based on the following
    factors:

♦

the amount of time since the last relevant valuation;

♦

whether there is an actual trade or relevant external quote
    available at the measurement date; and

♦

volatility associated with the primary pricing components.

We ensure that our fair value measurements are accurate and
    appropriate by relying upon various controls, including:

♦

an independent review and approval of valuation models;

♦

a detailed review of profit and loss conducted on a regular
    basis; and

♦

a validation of valuation model components against benchmark
    data and similar products, where possible.

We review any changes to valuation methodologies to ensure they
    are appropriate and justified, and refine valuation
    methodologies as more market-based data becomes available.

Additional information regarding our accounting policies for the
    determination of fair value is provided in Note 1
    (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under
    the heading “Fair Value Measurements.”

Qualitative
    Disclosures of Valuation Techniques

Loans.

Most loans recorded as trading account
    assets are valued based on market spreads for identical assets
    since they are actively traded. Therefore, these loans are
    classified as Level 2 because the fair value recorded is
    based on observable market data.

Securities (trading and available for
    sale).

We own several types of securities,
    requiring a range of valuation methods:

♦

Securities are classified as Level 1 when quoted market
    prices are available in an active market for the identical
    securities. Level 1 instruments include exchange-traded
    equity securities.

♦

Securities are classified as Level 2 if quoted prices for
    identical securities are not available, and we determine fair
    value using pricing models or quoted prices of similar
    securities. These instruments include municipal bonds; bonds
    backed by the U.S. government; corporate bonds; certain
    mortgage-backed securities; securities issued by the
    U.S. Treasury; money markets; and certain agency and
    corporate collateralized mortgage obligations. Inputs to the
    pricing models include actual trade data (i.e. spreads, credit
    ratings and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread
    tables, matrices, high-grade scales, option-adjusted spreads and
    standard inputs, such as yields, broker/dealer quotes, bids and
    offers.

♦

Securities are classified as Level 3 when there is limited
    activity in the market for a particular instrument. In such
    cases, we use internal models based on certain assumptions to
    determine fair value. Level 3 instruments include certain
    commercial mortgage-backed securities. Inputs for the
    Level 3 internal models include expected cash flows from
    the underlying loans, which take into account expected default
    and recovery percentages, market research and discount rates
    commensurate with current market conditions.

Private equity and mezzanine
    investments.

Private equity and mezzanine
    investments consist of investments in debt and equity securities
    through our Real Estate Capital line of business. They include
    direct investments made in a property, as well as



indirect investments made in funds that pool assets of many
    investors to invest in properties. There is not an active market
    in which to value these investments so we employ other valuation
    methods.

Direct investments in properties are initially valued based upon
    the transaction price. The carrying amount is then adjusted
    based upon the estimated future cash flows associated with the
    investments. Inputs used in determining future cash flows
    include the cost of build-out, future selling prices, current
    market outlook and operating performance of the particular
    investment. Indirect investments are valued using a methodology
    that is consistent with accounting guidance that allows us to
    use statements from the investment manager to calculate net
    asset value per share. A primary input used in estimating fair
    value is the most recent value of the capital accounts as
    reported by the general partners of the funds in which we
    invest. Private equity and mezzanine investments are classified
    as Level 3 assets since our judgment influences the
    determination of fair value.

Investments in real estate private equity funds are included
    within private equity and mezzanine investments. The main
    purpose of these funds is to acquire a portfolio of real estate
    investments that provides attractive risk-adjusted returns and
    current income for investors. Certain of these investments do
    not have readily determinable fair values and represent our
    ownership interest in an entity that follows measurement
    principles under investment company accounting. The following

(a)

We invest in passive funds, which
    are multi-investor private equity funds. These investments can
    never be redeemed. Instead, distributions are received through
    the liquidation of the underlying investments in the funds. Some
    funds have no restrictions on sale, while others require
    investors to remain in the fund until maturity. The funds will
    be liquidated over a period of one to six years.

(b)

We are a manager or co-manager of
    these funds. These investments can never be redeemed. Instead,
    distributions are received through the liquidation of the
    underlying investments in the funds. In addition, we receive
    management fees. We can sell or transfer our interest in any of
    these funds with the written consent of a majority of the
    fund’s investors. In one instance, the other co-manager of
    the fund must consent to the sale or transfer of our interest in
    the fund. The funds will mature over a period of four to seven
    years.

Principal investments.

Principal investments
    consist of investments in equity and debt instruments made by
    our principal investing entities. They include direct
    investments (investments made in a particular company), as well
    as indirect investments (investments made through funds that
    include other investors).

When quoted prices are available in an active market for the
    identical investment, we use the quoted prices in the valuation
    process, and the related investments are classified as
    Level 1 assets. However, in most cases, quoted market
    prices are not available for the identical investment, and we
    must perform valuations for direct investments based upon other
    sources and inputs, such as market multiples; historical and
    forecast earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
    amortization; net debt levels; and investment risk ratings.

Our indirect investments include primary and secondary
    investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture-
    and growth-oriented investing; these investments do not have
    readily determinable fair values. Indirect investments are
    valued using a methodology that is consistent with accounting
    guidance that allows us to estimate fair value based upon net
    asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units
    or an ownership interest in partners’ capital to which a
    proportionate share of net assets is attributed). A primary
    input used in estimating fair value is the most recent value of
    the capital accounts as reported by the general partners of the
    funds in which we invest. These investments are classified as
    Level 3 assets since our assumptions influence the overall
    determination of fair value. The following table presents the
    fair value of the indirect funds and related unfunded
    commitments at December 31, 2010:

(a)

Consists of buyout, venture capital
    and fund of funds. These investments can never be redeemed with
    the investee funds. Instead, distributions are received through
    the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. An
    investment in any one of these funds can be sold only with the
    approval of the fund’s general partners. We estimate that
    the underlying investments of the funds will be liquidated over
    a period of one to ten years.



(b)

Consists of funds invested in long
    and short positions of “stressed and distressed” fixed
    income-oriented securities with the goal of producing attractive
    risk-adjusted returns. The investments can be redeemed quarterly
    with 45 days’ notice. However, the fund’s general
    partners may impose quarterly redemption limits that may delay
    receipt of requested redemptions.

Derivatives.

Exchange-traded derivatives are
    valued using quoted prices and, therefore, are classified as
    Level 1 instruments. However, only a few types of
    derivatives are exchange-traded, so the majority of our
    derivative positions are valued using internally developed
    models based on market convention that use observable market
    inputs, such as interest rate curves, yield curves, LIBOR
    discount rates and curves, index pricing curves, foreign
    currency curves and volatility surfaces (the three-dimensional
    graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity).
    These derivative contracts, which are classified as Level 2
    instruments, include interest rate swaps, certain options, cross
    currency swaps and credit default swaps. In addition, we have a
    few customized derivative instruments and risk participations
    that are classified as Level 3 instruments. These
    derivative positions are valued using internally developed
    models, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as
    bond spreads and asset values, as well as our assumptions, such
    as loss probabilities and proxy prices.

Market convention implies a credit rating of “AA”
    equivalent in the pricing of derivative contracts, which assumes
    all counterparties have the same creditworthiness. To reflect
    the actual exposure on our derivative contracts related to both
    counterparty and our own creditworthiness, we record a fair
    value adjustment in the form of a default reserve. The credit
    component is valued by individual counterparty based on the
    probability of default, and considers master netting and
    collateral agreements. The default reserve is considered to be a
    Level 3 input.

Other assets and liabilities.

The value of
    our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, trade date
    receivables and payables, and short positions is driven by the
    valuation of the underlying securities. The underlying
    securities may include equity securities, which are valued using
    quoted market prices in an active market for identical
    securities, resulting in a Level 1 classification. If
    quoted prices for identical securities are not available, fair
    value is determined by using pricing models or quoted prices of
    similar securities, resulting in a Level 2 classification.
    For the interest rate-driven products, such as government bonds,
    U.S. Treasury bonds and other products backed by the
    U.S. government, inputs include spreads, credit ratings and
    interest rates. For the credit-driven products, such as
    corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities, inputs include
    actual trade data for comparable assets, and bids and offers.

The following tables show the change in the fair values of our
    Level 3 financial instruments for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. We mitigate the credit risk,
    interest rate risk and risk of loss related to many of these
    Level 3 instruments by using securities and derivative
    positions classified as Level 1 or Level 2.
    Level 1 or Level 2 instruments are not included in the

Assets
    Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments to
    fair value generally result from the application of accounting
    guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at
    the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. The
    following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2010 and 2009:

(a)

During 2010, we transferred
    $131 million of commercial and consumer loans from

held-for-sale

status to the

held-to-maturity

portfolio at their current fair value.

Impaired loans.

We typically adjust the carrying
    amount of our impaired loans when there is evidence of probable
    loss and the expected fair value of the loan is less than its
    contractual amount. The amount of the impairment may be
    determined based on the estimated present value of future cash
    flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral or the
    loan’s observable market price. Cash flow analysis
    considers internally developed inputs, such as discount rates,
    default rates, costs of foreclosure and changes in real estate
    values. The fair value of the collateral, which may take the
    form of real estate or personal property, is based on internal
    estimates, field observations and assessments provided by
    third-party appraisers. We perform or reaffirm appraisals of
    collateral-dependent impaired loans at least annually.
    Appraisals may occur more frequently if the most recent
    appraisal does not accurately reflect the current market, the
    debtor is seriously delinquent or chronically past due, or
    material deterioration in the performance of the project or
    condition of the property has occurred. Adjustments to outdated
    appraisals that result in an appraisal value less than the
    carrying amount of a collateral-dependent impaired loan are
    reflected in the allowance for loan and



lease losses. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated
    allowance based on cash flow analysis or the underlying
    collateral are classified as Level 3 assets, while those
    with a specifically allocated allowance based on an observable
    market price that reflects recent sale transactions for similar
    loans and collateral are classified as Level 2. Current
    market conditions, including credit risk profiles and decreased
    real estate values, impacted the inputs used in our internal
    valuation analysis, resulting in write-downs of impaired loans
    during 2010.

Loans held for sale and operating lease
    assets.

Through a quarterly analysis of our loan
    and lease portfolios held for sale, we determined that
    adjustments were necessary to record some of the portfolios at
    the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP.
    Adjusted loans held for sale portfolios totalled
    $15 million and $85 million, after adjustment, at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Current market
    conditions, including credit risk profiles, liquidity and
    decreased real estate values, impacted the inputs used in our
    internal models and other valuation methodologies, resulting in
    write-downs of these loan and lease portfolios.

Valuations of performing commercial mortgage and construction
    loans are conducted using internal models that rely on market
    data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets, including
    credit spreads, treasury rates, interest rate curves and risk
    profiles, as well as our own assumptions about the exit market
    for the loans and details about individual loans within the
    respective portfolios. Therefore, we have classified these loans
    as Level 3 assets. The inputs related to our assumptions
    and other internal loan data include changes in real estate
    values, costs of foreclosure, prepayment rates, default rates
    and discount rates.

Valuations of nonperforming commercial mortgage and construction
    loans are based on current agreements to sell the loans or
    approved discounted payoffs. If a negotiated value is not
    available, we use third-party appraisals, adjusted for current
    market conditions. Since valuations are based on unobservable
    data, these loans have been classified as Level 3 assets.

The valuation of commercial finance and operating leases is
    performed using an internal model that relies on market data,
    such as swap rates and bond ratings, as well as our own
    assumptions about the exit market for the leases and details
    about the individual leases in the portfolio. These leases have
    been classified as Level 3 assets. The inputs related to
    our assumptions include changes in the value of leased items and
    internal credit ratings. In addition, commercial leases may be
    valued using nonbinding bids when they are available and
    current. The leases valued under this methodology are classified
    as Level 2 assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

On a
    quarterly basis, we review impairment indicators to determine
    whether we need to evaluate the carrying amount of the goodwill
    and other intangible assets assigned to Key Community Bank and
    Key Corporate Bank. We also perform an annual impairment test
    for goodwill. Fair value of our reporting units is determined
    using both an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and
    a market approach (using publicly traded company and recent
    transactions data), which are weighted equally. Inputs used
    include market available data, such as industry, historical, and
    expected growth rates and peer valuations, as well as internally
    driven inputs, such as forecasted earnings and market
    participant insights. Since this valuation relies on a
    significant number of unobservable inputs, we have classified
    these assets as Level 3. For additional information on the
    results of recent goodwill impairment testing, see Note 10
    (“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”).

The fair value of other intangible assets is calculated using a
    cash flow approach. While the calculation to test for
    recoverability uses a number of assumptions that are based on
    current market conditions, the calculation is based primarily on
    unobservable assumptions; therefore, the assets are classified
    as Level 3. We use various assumptions depending on the
    type of intangible being valued; our assumptions may include
    such items as attrition rates, types of customers, revenue
    streams, prepayment rates, refinancing probabilities and credit
    defaults. For additional information on the results of other
    intangible assets impairment testing, see Note 10.

Other assets.

OREO and other repossessed
    properties are valued based on inputs such as appraisals and
    third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs.
    Generally, we classify these assets as Level 3. However,
    OREO and other repossessed properties for which we receive
    binding purchase agreements are classified as Level 2.
    Returned lease inventory is valued based on market data for
    similar assets and is classified as Level 2. Assets that
    are acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures are
    recorded initially as held for sale at the lower of the loan
    balance or fair value at the date of foreclosure. After
    foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically, and current
    market conditions may require the assets to be marked down
    further to a new cost basis.

Valuation
    Methods and Assumptions

We use valuation methods based on exit market prices in
    accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for fair
    value measurements. We determine fair value based on assumptions
    pertaining to the factors a market participant would consider in
    valuing the asset. A substantial portion of our fair value
    adjustments are related to liquidity. During 2010, the fair
    values of our loan portfolios improved primarily due to
    increasing liquidity in the loan markets. If we were to use
    different assumptions, the fair values shown in the preceding
    table could change significantly. Also, because the applicable
    accounting guidance for financial instruments excludes certain
    financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its
    disclosure requirements, the fair value amounts shown in the
    table above do not, by themselves, represent the underlying
    value of our company as a whole.

Education lending business.

The discontinued
    education lending business consists of assets and liabilities
    (recorded at fair value) in the securitization trusts, which
    were consolidated as of January 1, 2010 in accordance with
    new consolidation accounting guidance, as well as loans in
    portfolio (recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation
    reserves) and loans held for sale, both of which are outside the
    trusts. The fair value of loans held for sale was identical to
    the aggregate carrying amount of the loans. All of these loans
    were excluded from the table above as follows:

♦

loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $3.2 billion
    ($2.8 billion fair value) at December 31, 2010 and
    $3.4 billion ($2.5 billion fair value) at
    December 31, 2009;

♦

loans held for sale of $15 million at December 31,
    2010 and $434 million at December 31, 2009; and

♦

loans in the trusts at fair value of $3.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010.

As discussed above, loans at fair value were not consolidated
    until January 1, 2010. Securities issued by the education
    lending securitization trusts, which are the primary liabilities
    of the trusts, totaling $3.0 billion at fair value, also
    are excluded from the



above table at December 31, 2010. Additional information
    regarding the consolidation of the education lending
    securitization trusts is provided in Note 13
    (“Acquisition, Divestiture and Discontinued
    Operations”).

Residential real estate mortgage
    loans.

Residential real estate mortgage loans with
    carrying amounts of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2010
    and 2009 are included in “Loans, net of allowance” in
    the above table.

Short-term financial instruments.

For
    financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity
    of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an
    approximation of fair values.

7. Securities

The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate
    fair value of our securities available for sale and

held-to-maturity

securities are presented in the following table. Gross
    unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the
    amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance
    sheet as of the dates indicated. Accordingly, the amount of
    these gains and losses may change in the future as market
    conditions change. For more information about our securities

The $87 million of gross unrealized losses at
    December 31, 2010 relates to 34 fixed-rate collateralized
    mortgage obligations, which we invested in as part of an overall
    A/LM strategy. Since these securities have fixed interest rates,
    their fair value is sensitive to movements in market interest
    rates. These securities have a weighted-average maturity of
    4.0 years at December 31, 2010.

The unrealized losses within each investment category are
    considered temporary since we expect to collect all
    contractually due amounts from these securities. Accordingly,
    these investments have been reduced to their fair value through
    OCI, not earnings.



We regularly assess our securities portfolio for OTTI. The
    assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the
    underlying collateral, the financial condition of the issuer,
    the extent and duration of the loss, our intent related to the
    individual securities, and the likelihood that we will have to
    sell securities prior to expected recovery.

Debt securities identified to have OTTI are written down to
    their current fair value. For those debt securities that we
    intend to sell, or more-likely-than-not will be required to
    sell, prior to the expected recovery of the amortized cost, the
    entire impairment (i.e., the difference between amortized cost
    and the fair value) is recognized in earnings. For those debt
    securities that we do not intend to sell, or
    more-likely-than-not will not be required to sell, prior to
    expected recovery, the credit portion of OTTI is recognized in
    earnings, while the remaining OTTI is recognized in equity as a
    component of AOCI on the balance sheet. As shown in the
    following table, we did not have any impairment losses
    recognized in earnings for the three months ended
    December 31, 2010.

As a result of adopting new consolidation guidance on
    January 1, 2010, we have consolidated our education loan
    securitization trusts. To that end, we have eliminated from our
    balance sheet the residual interests that we continue to retain
    in these securitization trusts. Before we consolidated the
    trusts, we accounted for the residual interests associated with
    these securitizations as debt securities that we regularly
    assessed for impairment. These residual interests are no longer
    assessed for impairment. The consolidated assets and liabilities
    related to these trusts are included in “discontinued
    assets” and “discontinued liabilities” on the
    balance sheet as a result of our decision to exit the education
    lending business. For more information about this discontinued
    operation, see Note 13 (“Acquisition, Divestiture and
    Discontinued Operations”).

8. Derivatives
    and Hedging Activities

We are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through
    our subsidiary, KeyBank. Derivative instruments are contracts
    between two or more parties that have a notional amount and an
    underlying variable, require no net investment and allow for the
    net settlement of positions. A derivative’s notional amount
    serves as the basis for the payment provision of the contract,
    and takes the form of units, such as shares or dollars. A
    derivative’s underlying variable is a specified interest
    rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate,
    index or other variable. The interaction between the notional
    amount and the underlying variable determines the number of
    units to be exchanged between the parties and influences the
    fair value of the derivative contract.

The primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps,
    caps, floors and futures; foreign exchange contracts; energy
    derivatives; credit derivatives; and equity derivatives.
    Generally, these instruments help us manage exposure to interest
    rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in the loan
    portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. As further
    discussed in this Note:

♦

interest rate risk represents the possibility that the EVE or
    net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations
    in interest rates,

♦

credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s
    inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance
    terms, and

♦

foreign exchange risk is the risk that an exchange rate will
    adversely affect the fair value of a financial instrument.

Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on
    the balance sheet, after taking into account the effects of
    bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. These
    agreements allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with
    a single counterparty on a net basis, and to offset net
    derivative positions with related collateral, where applicable.
    As a result, we could have derivative contracts with negative
    fair values included in derivative assets on the balance sheet
    and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative
    liabilities.

At December 31, 2010, after taking into account the effects
    of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had
    $249 million of derivative assets and $210 million of
    derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for
    hedging purposes. As of the same date, after taking into account
    the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting
    agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had
    derivative assets of $757 million and derivative
    liabilities of $932 million that were not designated as
    hedging instruments.

The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act may limit the types of
    derivatives activities that KeyBank and other insured depository
    institutions may conduct. As a result, our use of one or more of
    the types of derivatives noted above may change in the future.

Additional information regarding our accounting policies for
    derivatives is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading
    “Derivatives.”

Derivatives
    Designated in Hedge Relationships

Net interest income and the EVE change in response to changes in
    interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity
    characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
    liabilities. We utilize derivatives that have been designated as
    part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable
    accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging to minimize
    interest rate volatility, which then minimizes the volatility of
    net interest income and the EVE. The primary derivative
    instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate
    swaps, which convert the contractual interest rate index of

agreed-upon

amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to
    another interest rate index.

We designate certain “receive fixed/pay variable”
    interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. These swaps are used
    primarily to modify our consolidated exposure to changes in
    interest rates. These contracts convert certain fixed-rate
    long-term debt into variable-rate obligations. As a result, we
    receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making
    variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without
    exchanging the notional amounts.

Similarly, we designate certain “receive fixed/pay
    variable” interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These
    contracts effectively convert certain floating-rate loans into
    fixed-rate loans to reduce the potential adverse effect of
    interest rate decreases on future interest income. Again, we
    receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making
    variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without
    exchanging the notional amounts. We also designate certain
    “pay fixed/receive variable” interest rate swaps as
    cash flow hedges. These swaps convert certain floating-rate debt
    into fixed-rate debt.

We also use interest rate swaps to hedge the floating-rate debt
    that funds fixed-rate leases entered into by our Equipment
    Finance line of business. These swaps are designated as cash
    flow hedges to mitigate the interest rate mismatch between the
    fixed-rate lease cash flows and the floating-rate payments on
    the debt.



The derivatives used for managing foreign currency exchange risk
    are cross currency swaps. We have outstanding issuances of
    medium-term notes that are denominated in foreign currencies.
    The notes are subject to translation risk, which represents the
    possibility that the fair value of the foreign-denominated debt
    will change based on movement of the underlying foreign currency
    spot rate. It is our practice to hedge against potential fair
    value changes caused by changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates and interest rates. The hedge converts the notes to a
    variable-rate U.S. currency-denominated debt, which is
    designated as a fair value hedge of foreign currency exchange
    risk.

Derivatives
    Not Designated in Hedge Relationships

On occasion, we enter into interest rate swap contracts to
    manage economic risks but do not designate the instruments in
    hedge relationships. The amount of these contracts at
    December 31, 2010 was not significant.

Like other financial services institutions, we originate loans
    and extend credit, both of which expose us to credit risk. We
    actively manage our overall loan portfolio and the associated
    credit risk in a manner consistent with asset quality
    objectives. This process entails the use of credit
    derivatives — primarily credit default swaps. Credit
    default swaps enable us to transfer to a third party a portion
    of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of
    credit, and to manage portfolio concentration and correlation
    risks. Occasionally, we also provide credit protection to other
    lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. This objective
    is accomplished primarily through the use of an investment-grade
    diversified dealer-traded basket of credit default swaps. These
    transactions may generate fee income, and diversify and reduce
    overall portfolio credit risk volatility. Although we use credit
    default swaps for risk management purposes, they are not treated
    as hedging instruments as defined by the applicable accounting
    guidance for derivatives and hedging.

We also enter into derivative contracts for other purposes,
    including:

♦

interest rate swap, cap, floor and futures contracts entered
    into generally to accommodate the needs of commercial loan
    clients;

♦

energy swap and options contracts entered into to accommodate
    the needs of clients;

♦

interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts used
    for proprietary trading purposes;

♦

positions with third parties that are intended to offset or
    mitigate the interest rate or market risk related to client
    positions discussed above; and

♦

foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to accommodate
    the needs of clients.

These contracts are not designated as part of hedge
    relationships.

Fair
    Values, Volume of Activity and Gain/Loss Information Related to
    Derivative Instruments

The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative
    instruments on a gross basis as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009. The change in the notional amounts of these derivatives by
    type from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010,
    indicates the volume of our derivative transaction activity
    during 2010. The notional amounts are not affected by bilateral
    collateral and master netting agreements. Our derivative
    instruments are included in “derivative assets” or
    “derivative liabilities” on the balance sheet, as
    indicated in the following table:

Netting adjustments represent the
    amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and
    liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with
    the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into
    account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting
    agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with
    a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net
    derivative position with the related collateral.

Fair value hedges.

Instruments designated as
    fair value hedges are recorded at fair value and included in
    “derivative assets” or “derivative
    liabilities” on the balance sheet. The effective portion of
    a change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a fair
    value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time as a change
    in fair value of the hedged item, resulting in no effect on net
    income. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of
    such a hedging instrument is recorded in “other
    income” on the income statement with no corresponding
    offset. During 2010, we did not exclude any portion of these
    hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
    While there is some ineffectiveness in our hedging
    relationships, all of our fair value hedges remained
    “highly effective” as of December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on
    our fair value hedges for the years ended December 31, 2010

Cash flow hedges.

Instruments designated as
    cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value and included in
    “derivative assets” or “derivative
    liabilities” on the balance sheet. Initially, the effective
    portion of a gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a
    component of AOCI on the balance sheet and is subsequently
    reclassified into income when the hedged transaction impacts
    earnings (e.g., when we pay variable-rate interest on debt,
    receive variable-rate interest on commercial loans or sell
    commercial real estate loans). The ineffective portion of cash
    flow hedging transactions is included in “other
    income” on the income statement. During 2010, we did not
    exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness. While there is some
    ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships, all of our cash
    flow hedges remained “highly effective” as of
    December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on
    our cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2010

    The table includes the effective portion of net gains (losses)

Considering the interest rates, yield curves and notional
    amounts as of December 31, 2010, we would expect to
    reclassify an estimated $8 million of net losses on
    derivative instruments from AOCI to income during the next
    twelve months. In addition, we expect to reclassify
    approximately $20 million of net gains related to
    terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next
    twelve months. The maximum length of time over which we hedge
    forecasted transactions is eighteen years.

Nonhedging instruments.

Our derivatives that
    are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair
    value in “derivative assets” and “derivative
    liabilities” on the balance sheet. Adjustments to the fair
    values of these instruments, as well as any premium paid or
    received, are included in “investment banking and capital
    markets income (loss)” on the income statement.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on
    our derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments

Counterparty
    Credit Risk

Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element
    of credit risk. This risk is measured as the expected positive
    replacement value of the contracts. We use several means to
    mitigate and manage exposure to credit risk on derivative
    contracts. We generally enter into bilateral collateral and
    master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of
    all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of
    default. Additionally, we monitor counterparty credit risk
    exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on our
    total credit exposure across all product types. We review our
    collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral
    with our counterparties in accordance with ISDA and other
    related agreements. We generally hold collateral in the form of
    cash and highly rated securities issued by the

We enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups:
    broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Since these groups have
    different economic characteristics, we have different methods
    for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk.

We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for
    various risk management purposes and proprietary trading
    purposes. These types of transactions generally are high dollar
    volume. We generally enter into bilateral collateral and master
    netting agreements with these counterparties. At
    December 31, 2010, after taking into account the effects of
    bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had gross
    exposure of $854 million to broker-dealers and banks. We
    had net exposure of $253 million after the application of
    master netting agreements and collateral; our net exposure to
    broker-dealers and banks at December 31, 2010, was reduced
    to $31 million with $222 million of additional
    collateral held in the form of securities.

We enter into transactions with clients to accommodate their
    business needs. These types of transactions generally are low
    dollar volume. We generally enter into master netting agreements
    with these counterparties. In addition, we mitigate our overall
    portfolio exposure and market risk by entering into offsetting
    positions, U.S. Treasuries, Eurodollar futures and other
    derivative contracts. Due to the smaller size and magnitude of
    the individual contracts with clients, collateral generally is
    not exchanged in connection with these derivative transactions.
    To address the risk of default associated with the
    uncollateralized contracts, we have established a default
    reserve (included in “derivative assets”) in the
    amount of $48 million at December 31, 2010, which we
    estimate to be the potential future losses on amounts due from
    client counterparties in the event of default. At
    December 31, 2009, the default reserve was
    $59 million. At December 31, 2010, after taking into
    account the effects of master netting agreements, we had gross
    exposure of $1 billion to client counterparties. We had net
    exposure of $752 million on our derivatives with clients
    after the application of master netting agreements, collateral
    and the related reserve.

Credit
    Derivatives

We are both a buyer and seller of credit protection through the
    credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to
    manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial
    lending and swap obligations. We also sell credit derivatives,
    mainly index credit default swaps, to diversify the
    concentration risk within our loan portfolio.



The following table summarizes the fair value of our credit
    derivatives purchased and sold by type. The fair value of credit
    derivatives presented below does not take into account the
    effects of bilateral collateral or master netting agreements.

Single name credit default swaps are bilateral contracts whereby
    the seller agrees, for a premium, to provide protection against
    the credit risk of a specific entity (referred to as the
    “reference entity”) in connection with a specific debt
    obligation. The protected credit risk is related to adverse
    credit events, such as bankruptcy, failure to make payments, and
    acceleration or restructuring of obligations, identified in the
    credit derivative contract. As the seller of a single name
    credit derivative, we would be required to pay the purchaser the
    difference between the par value and the market price of the
    debt obligation (cash settlement) or receive the specified
    referenced asset in exchange for payment of the par value
    (physical settlement) if the underlying reference entity
    experiences a predefined credit event. For a single name credit
    derivative, the notional amount represents the maximum amount
    that a seller could be required to pay. In the event that
    physical settlement occurs and we receive our portion of the
    related debt obligation, we will join other creditors in the
    liquidation process, which may result in the recovery of a
    portion of the amount paid under the credit default swap
    contract. We also may purchase offsetting credit derivatives for
    the same reference entity from third parties that will permit us
    to recover the amount we pay should a credit event occur.

A traded credit default swap index represents a position on a
    basket or portfolio of reference entities. As a seller of
    protection on a credit default swap index, we would be required
    to pay the purchaser if one or more of the entities in the index
    had a credit event. For a credit default swap index, the
    notional amount represents the maximum amount that a seller
    could be required to pay. Upon a credit event, the amount
    payable is based on the percentage of the notional amount
    allocated to the specific defaulting entity.

The majority of transactions represented by the
    “other” category shown in the above table are risk
    participation agreements. In these transactions, the lead
    participant has a swap agreement with a customer. The lead
    participant (purchaser of protection) then enters into a risk
    participation agreement with a counterparty (seller of
    protection), under which the counterparty receives a fee to
    accept a portion of the lead participant’s credit risk. If
    the customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to
    the risk participation agreement must reimburse the lead
    participant for the counterparty’s percentage of the
    positive fair value of the customer swap as of the default date.
    If the customer swap has a negative fair value, the counterparty
    has no reimbursement requirements. The notional amount
    represents the maximum amount that the seller could be required
    to pay. If the customer defaults on the swap contract and the
    seller fulfills its payment obligations under the risk
    participation agreement, the seller is entitled to a pro rata
    share of the lead participant’s claims against the customer
    under the terms of the swap agreement.

The following table provides information on the types of credit
    derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010, and 2009. Except as noted, the
    payment/performance risk assessment is based on the default
    probabilities for the underlying reference entities’ debt
    obligations using a Moody’s credit ratings matrix known as
    Moody’s “Idealized” Cumulative Default Rates. The
    payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a
    weighted-average of the default probabilities for all reference
    entities in the respective portfolios. These default
    probabilities are directly correlated to the probability that we
    will have to make a payment under the credit derivative
    contracts.

The other credit derivatives were
    not referenced to an entity’s debt obligation. We
    determined the payment/performance risk based on the probability
    that we could be required to pay the maximum amount under the
    credit derivatives. We have determined that the
    payment/performance risk associated with the other credit
    derivatives was low (i.e., less than or equal to 30% probability
    of payment).



Credit
    Risk Contingent Features

We have entered into certain derivative contracts that require
    us to post collateral to the counterparties when these contracts
    are in a net liability position. The amount of collateral to be
    posted is based on the amount of the net liability and
    thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured
    credit ratings with Moody’s and S&P. Collateral
    requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which
    are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the
    ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the
    counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties
    also have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements
    with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually
    investment-grade level (i.e., “Baa3” for Moody’s
    and “BBB-” for S&P). At December 31, 2010,
    KeyBank’s ratings with Moody’s and S&P were
    “A3” and “A-,” respectively, and
    KeyCorp’s ratings with Moody’s and S&P were
    “Baa1” and “BBB+,” respectively. If there
    was a downgrade of our ratings, we could be required to post
    additional collateral under those ISDA Master Agreements where
    we are in a net liability position. As of December 31,
    2010, the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with
    credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing
    collateral posting or termination provisions based on our
    ratings) held by KeyBank that were in a net liability position
    totaled $1 billion, which includes $584 million in
    derivative assets and $1.6 billion in derivative
    liabilities. We had $1 billion in cash and securities
    collateral posted to cover those positions as of
    December 31, 2010.

The following table summarizes the additional cash and
    securities collateral that KeyBank would have been required to
    deliver had the credit risk contingent features been triggered
    for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The additional collateral
    amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which
    KeyBank’s ratings are downgraded one, two or three ratings
    as of December 31, 2010, and take into account all
    collateral already posted. At December 31, 2010, KeyCorp
    did not have any derivatives in a net liability position that
    contained credit risk contingent features.

If KeyBank’s ratings had been downgraded below investment

    in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral
    already posted. KeyBank’s long-term senior unsecured credit
    rating currently is five ratings above investment grade at
    Moody’s and four ratings above investment grade at S&P.



9.
    Mortgage Servicing Assets

We originate and periodically sell commercial mortgage loans but
    continue to service those loans for the buyers. We also may
    purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for
    other lenders. A servicing asset is recorded if we purchase or
    retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees
    that exceed the going market rate. Changes in the carrying
    amount of mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows:

The fair value of mortgage servicing assets is determined by
    calculating the present value of future cash flows associated
    with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of
    assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The
    primary economic assumptions used to measure the fair value of
    our mortgage servicing assets at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, are:

♦

prepayment speed generally at an annual rate of 0.00% to 25.00%;

♦

expected credit losses at a static rate of 2.00% to 3.00%;

♦

residual cash flows discount rate of 7.00% to 15.00%; and

♦

value assigned to escrow funds at an interest rate of 2.50% to
    7.18%.

Changes in these economic assumptions could cause the fair value
    of mortgage servicing assets to change in the future. The volume
    of loans serviced and expected credit losses are critical to the
    valuation of servicing assets. At December 31, 2010, a
    1.00% decrease in the value assigned to the escrow deposits
    would cause a $33 million decrease in the fair value of our
    mortgage servicing rights; and an increase in the assumed
    default rate of commercial mortgage loans would cause a
    $6 million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage
    servicing assets.

Contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans
    totaled $72 million for 2010, $71 million for 2009 and
    $68 million for 2008. We have elected to remeasure
    servicing assets using the amortization method. The amortization
    of servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the
    period of, the estimated net servicing income. The amortization
    of servicing assets for each period, as shown in the preceding
    table, is recorded as a reduction to fee income. Both the
    contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded in
    “other income” on the income statement.

On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced a ratings
    downgrade for ten large U.S. regional banks, including
    KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from systemic
    support. Ratings for KeyBank’s short-term borrowings,
    senior long-term debt and subordinated debt were downgraded one
    notch—from

P-1

to

P-2,

A2 to
    A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. The new ratings have breached
    minimum thresholds established by Moody’s in connection
    with the securitizations that Key services, and impact the
    ability of KeyBank to hold certain escrow deposit balances
    related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key
    and rated by Moody’s. These escrow deposit balances range
    from $1.50 to $1.85 billion. Since the downgrade, KeyBank
    has been in discussions with Moody’s regarding an
    alternative investment vehicle for these funds that would be
    acceptable to Moody’s and maintain the funds at KeyBank.
    Subsequent to Moody’s announcement that was publicly issued
    on January 19, 2011, Moody’s indicated to KeyBank that
    certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing
    operations will be required to be moved to another financial
    institution which meets the minimum ratings threshold within the
    first quarter of 2011. As a result of this decision by
    Moody’s, KeyBank has determined that moving these escrow
    deposit balances results in an immaterial impairment of these
    mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank has ample liquidity reserves
    to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a
    strong liquidity position.

Additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage
    and other servicing assets is included in Note 1
    (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under
    the heading “Servicing Assets.”



10. Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets
    acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value.
    Other intangible assets are primarily the net present value of
    future economic benefits to be derived from the purchase of core
    deposits. Additional information pertaining to our accounting
    policy for goodwill and other intangible assets is summarized in
    Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies”) under the heading “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.”

Our annual goodwill impairment testing is performed as of
    October 1 each year. On that date in 2010, we determined that
    the estimated fair value of the Key Community Bank unit was 18%
    greater than its carrying amount; in 2009, the excess was 13%.
    Therefore, no further testing was required. At both dates in
    2010 and 2009, we also performed a sensitivity analysis of the
    estimated fair value of the Key Community Bank unit, which
    indicated that the fair value continued to exceed the carrying
    amount under deteriorating assumptions. If actual results and
    market and economic conditions were to differ from the
    assumptions and data used in this testing, the estimated fair
    value of the Key Community Bank unit could change in the future.

In September 2008, we decided to limit new student loans to
    those backed by government guarantee. As a result, we wrote off
    $4 million of goodwill during the third quarter of 2008.

Our annual goodwill impairment testing performed as of
    October 1, 2008, indicated that the estimated fair value of
    the Key Corporate Bank unit was less than its carrying amount,
    reflecting unprecedented weakness in the financial markets. As a
    result, we recorded a $465 million pre-tax impairment
    charge.

During the first quarter of 2009, our review of impairment
    indicators prompted additional impairment testing of the
    carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets
    assigned to the Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank units
    because, although the estimated fair value of the Key Community
    Bank unit was greater than its carrying amount, the estimated
    fair value of the Key Corporate Bank unit was less than its
    carrying amount, reflecting continued weakness in the financial
    markets. Based on the results of additional impairment testing,
    we recorded a $223 million pre-tax impairment charge and
    wrote off all of the remaining goodwill that had been assigned
    to the Key Corporate Bank unit.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin,
    a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments
    for institutional customers. Accordingly, we have accounted for
    this business as a discontinued operation. Of the
    $223 million impairment charge recorded for the Key
    Corporate Bank unit, $27 million related to the Austin
    discontinued operation, and has been reclassified to
    “income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
    taxes” on the income statement. See Note 13
    (“Acquisition, Divestiture and Discontinued
    Operations”) for additional information regarding the
    Austin discontinued operations.

Based on reviews of impairment indicators during the second,
    third and fourth quarters of 2009, further reviews of goodwill
    recorded in our Key Community Bank unit were necessary. These
    supplemental reviews indicated that the estimated fair value of
    the Key Community Bank unit continued to exceed its carrying
    amount at June 30, 2009, September 30, 2009, and
    December 31, 2009. No further impairment testing was
    required.

Based on our quarterly review of impairment indicators during
    the first nine months of 2010, we determined that further
    reviews of goodwill recorded in our Key Community Bank unit were
    necessary. These reviews indicated the estimated fair value of
    the Key Community Bank unit continued to exceed its carrying
    amount at September 30, 2010, June 30, 2010 and
    March 31, 2010. No further impairment testing was required.
    Our quarterly review of impairment indicators at
    December 31, 2010, indicated that no further review was
    necessary since no indicators were triggered. There has been no
    goodwill associated with our Key Corporate Bank unit since the
    first quarter of 2009.

During 2010, customer relationship intangible assets of
    $15 million were written off against the purchase price to
    determine our net gain as a result of our sale of Tuition
    Management Systems in December 2010.

During 2009, we identified a $45 million intangible asset
    related to vendor relationships in the equipment leasing
    business that was impaired as a result of our actions to cease
    conducting business in the commercial vehicle and office
    equipment leasing markets. As a result, we recorded a
    $45 million charge to write off this intangible asset.

During 2008, we recorded core deposit intangibles with a fair
    value of $33 million in conjunction with the purchase of
    U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. These core deposit intangibles are
    being amortized using the economic depletion method over a
    period of ten years. Additional information pertaining to this
    acquisition is included in Note 13.

Intangible asset amortization expense was $13 million for
    2010, $76 million for 2009 and $29 million for 2008.
    Estimated amortization expense for intangible assets for each of
    the next five years is as follows: 2011 —
    $5 million; 2012 — $4 million;
    2013 — $4 million; 2014 —
    $3 million; and 2015 — $2 million.

11. Variable
    Interest Entities

A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or
    other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria:

♦

The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its
    activities without additional subordinated financial support
    from another party.

♦

The entity’s investors lack the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the entity’s
    economic performance.

♦

The entity’s equity at risk holders do not have the
    obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual
    returns.

♦

The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to
    their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of
    the entity’s activities involve, or are conducted on behalf
    of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.

Our VIEs are summarized below. We define a “significant
    interest” in a VIE as a subordinated interest that exposes
    us to a significant portion, but not the majority, of the
    VIE’s expected losses or residual returns, even though we
    do not have the power to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance.

Our involvement with VIEs is described below.

Consolidated VIEs



LIHTC guaranteed funds.

KAHC formed limited
    partnerships, known as funds, that invested in LIHTC operating
    partnerships. Interests in these funds were offered in
    syndication to qualified investors who paid a fee to KAHC for a
    guaranteed return. We also earned syndication fees from the
    funds and continue to earn asset management fees. The
    funds’ assets primarily are investments in LIHTC operating
    partnerships, which totaled $75 million at
    December 31, 2010. These investments are recorded in
    “accrued income and other assets” on the balance sheet
    and serve as collateral for the funds’ limited obligations.

We have not formed new funds or added LIHTC partnerships since
    October 2003. However, we continue to act as asset manager and
    provide occasional funding for existing funds under a guarantee
    obligation. As a result of this guarantee obligation, we have
    determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these funds.
    We recorded additional expenses of approximately $8 million
    related to this guarantee obligation during 2010. Additional
    information on return guarantee agreements with LIHTC investors
    is presented in Note 16 (“Commitments, Contingent
    Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading
    “Guarantees.”

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for
    distinguishing liabilities from equity, third-party interests
    associated with our LIHTC guaranteed funds are considered
    mandatorily redeemable instruments and are recorded in
    “accrued expense and other liabilities” on the balance
    sheet. However, the FASB has indefinitely deferred the
    measurement and recognition provisions of this accounting
    guidance for mandatorily redeemable third-party interests
    associated with finite-lived subsidiaries, such as our LIHTC
    guaranteed funds. We adjust our financial statements each period
    for the third-party investors’ share of the funds’
    profits and losses. At December 31, 2010, we estimated the
    settlement value of these third-party interests to be between
    $59 million and $64 million, while the recorded value,
    including reserves, totaled $104 million. The partnership
    agreement for each of our guaranteed funds requires the fund to
    be dissolved by a certain date.

    September 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed
    education lending business. Therefore, we have accounted for
    this business as a discontinued operation. In the past, as part
    of our education lending business model, we originated and
    securitized education loans. As the transferor, we retained a
    portion of the risk in the form of a residual interest and also
    retained the right to service the securitized loans and receive
    servicing fees. We have not securitized any education loans
    since 2006.

As a result of adopting the new consolidation accounting
    guidance issued by the FASB in June 2009, we have consolidated
    our ten outstanding education loan securitization trusts as of
    January 1, 2010. We were required to consolidate these
    trusts because we hold the residual interests and as the master
    servicer we have the power to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the trusts’ economic performance. We
    elected to consolidate these trusts at fair value. The trust
    assets can be used only to settle the obligations or securities
    that the trusts issue; we cannot sell the assets or transfer the
    liabilities. The security holders or beneficial interest holders
    do not have recourse to us, and we do not have any liability
    recorded related to their securities. Additional information
    regarding the education loan securitization trusts is provided
    in Note 13 (“Acquisition, Divestiture and Discontinued
    Operations”) under the heading “Education
    lending.”

Unconsolidated VIEs

LIHTC nonguaranteed funds.

Although we hold
    significant interests in certain nonguaranteed funds that we
    formed and funded, we have determined that we are not the
    primary beneficiary because we do not absorb the majority of the
    funds’ expected losses and do not have the power to direct
    activities that most significantly impact the economic
    performance of these entities. At December 31, 2010, assets
    of these unconsolidated nonguaranteed funds totaled
    $149 million. Our maximum exposure to loss in connection
    with these funds is minimal, and we do not have any liability
    recorded related to the funds. We have not formed nonguaranteed
    funds since October 2003.

LIHTC investments.

Through Key Community
    Bank, we have made investments directly in LIHTC operating
    partnerships formed by third parties. As a limited partner in
    these operating partnerships, we are allocated tax credits and
    deductions associated with the underlying properties. We have
    determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these
    investments because the general partners have the power to
    direct the activities that most significantly impact the
    economic performance of the partnership and have the obligation
    to absorb expected losses and the right to receive benefits.

At December 31, 2010, assets of these unconsolidated LIHTC
    operating partnerships totaled approximately $938 million.
    At December 31, 2010, our maximum exposure to loss in
    connection with these partnerships is the unamortized investment
    balance of $379 million plus $83 million of tax
    credits claimed but subject to recapture. We do not have any
    liability recorded related to these investments because we
    believe the likelihood of any loss is remote. During 2010, we
    did not obtain significant direct investments (either
    individually or in the aggregate) in LIHTC operating
    partnerships.

We have additional investments in unconsolidated LIHTC operating
    partnerships that are held by the consolidated LIHTC guaranteed
    funds. Total assets of these operating partnerships were
    approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010. The
    tax credits and deductions associated with these properties are
    allocated to the funds’ investors based on their ownership
    percentages. We have determined that we are not the primary
    beneficiary of these partnerships because the general partners
    have the power to direct the activities that most significantly
    impact their economic performance and the obligation to absorb



expected losses and right to receive residual returns.
    Information regarding our exposure to loss in connection with
    these guaranteed funds is included in Note 16 under the
    heading “Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC
    investors.”

Commercial and residential real estate investments and
    principal investments.

Our Principal Investing unit
    and the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line
    of business make equity and mezzanine investments, some of which
    are in VIEs. These investments are held by nonregistered
    investment companies subject to the provisions of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide, “Audits of Investment
    Companies.” We are not currently applying the accounting or
    disclosure provisions in the applicable accounting guidance for
    consolidations to these investments, which remain
    unconsolidated. The FASB has indefinitely deferred the effective
    date of this guidance for such nonregistered investment
    companies.

Income tax (benefit) expense on
    securities transactions totaled $5 million in 2010,
    $42 million in 2009 and ($.8) million in 2008. Income
    tax expense excludes equity- and gross receipts-based taxes,
    which are assessed in lieu of an income tax in certain states in
    which we operate. These taxes, which are recorded in
    “noninterest expense” on the income statement, totaled
    $19 million in 2010, $24 million in 2009 and
    $21 million in 2008.

Significant components of our deferred tax assets and
    liabilities included in “accrued income and other
    assets” and “accrued expense and other
    liabilities,” respectively, on the balance sheet, are as

From continuing operations.

We conduct quarterly assessments of all available evidence to
    determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are
    more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. The
    available evidence used in connection with these assessments
    includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future
    taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies and projected
    future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments
    involve a degree of subjectivity which may undergo significant
    change. Based on these criteria, and in particular our
    projections for future taxable income, we currently believe it
    is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred
    tax asset in future periods. However, changes to the evidence
    used in our assessments could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations in the period in which they occur.

At December 31, 2010, we had a federal net operating loss
    and a credit carryforward of $129 million and
    $390 million, respectively. Additionally, we had a state
    net operating loss carryforward of $764 million. These
    carryforwards are subject to limitations imposed by tax laws
    and, if not utilized, will gradually expire through 2030.

Prior to 2010, we did not provide federal income taxes or

non-U.S. withholding

taxes on undistributed earnings from our

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

with the exception of Canada, as these earnings were considered
    to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. As we consider
    alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans,
    opportunities may arise to repatriate part or all of these
    earnings in the future. As a result, we have changed our
    assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting these earnings which
    total approximately $86 million. Therefore, we have
    included $32 million in our 2010 income tax expense for any
    taxes that would be incurred in connection with the repatriation
    of these earnings, if any.

Liability
    for Unrecognized Tax Benefits

$


$


Each quarter, we review the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    recorded in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance
    for income taxes. Any adjustment to unrecognized tax benefits
    for the interest is recorded in income tax expense. As shown in
    the above table, during 2009, we decreased the amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits associated with our leveraged lease
    transactions by $1.6 billion to reflect the payment of all
    federal and state income tax liabilities due as a result of the
    settlement of the leveraged lease issues. The amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our
    effective tax rate was $23 million and $21 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We do not
    currently anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits will significantly change over the next twelve months.

As permitted under the applicable accounting guidance for income
    taxes, it is our policy to record interest and penalties related
    to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recorded
    net interest credits of $12 million in 2010, and
    $99 million in 2009 respectively and an interest expense of
    $602 million in 2008. The portion of the respective
    interest credit or expense attributable to our leveraged lease
    transactions was $6 million in 2010, $62 million in
    2009 and $598 million in 2008. We recovered penalties of
    $5 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2009. At
    December 31, 2010, we had an accrued interest payable of
    $3 million, compared to a receivable of $48 million at
    December 31, 2009. Our liability for accrued state tax
    penalties was $20 million and $30 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We file federal income tax returns, as well as returns in
    various state and foreign jurisdictions. Currently, the IRS is
    auditing our income tax returns for the 2007 and 2008 tax years.
    We are not subject to income tax examinations by other tax
    authorities for years prior to 2001, except in California and
    New York. Income tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are
    subject to examination as far back as 1995 (California) and 2000
    (New York).



13.
    Acquisition, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations

Acquisition

U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc.

On January 1, 2008, we acquired U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc.,
    the holding company for Union State Bank, a 31-branch
    state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Orangeburg, New
    York. U.S.B. Holding Co. had assets of $2.8 billion and
    deposits of $1.8 billion at the date of acquisition. Under
    the terms of the agreement, we exchanged 9,895,000 Common
    Shares, with a value of $348 million, and $194 million
    in cash for all of the outstanding shares of U.S.B. Holding Co.
    In connection with the acquisition, we recorded goodwill of
    approximately $350 million in the Key Community Bank
    reporting unit. The acquisition expanded our presence in markets
    both within and contiguous to our current operations in the
    Hudson Valley.

Divestiture

Tuition Management Systems

On November 21, 2010, we entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell substantially all of the net assets of the
    Tuition Management Systems business (TMS) to a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Boston-based First Marblehead Corporation, for
    approximately $47 million in cash. TMS, which is based in
    Warwick, Rhode Island, provides tuition billing, planning,
    counseling and payment technology services to approximately
    1,200 colleges, universities and elementary and secondary
    schools in 47 states. The transaction closed on
    December 31, 2010. We wrote off against the purchase price,
    to determine the net gain on sale, $15 million of customer
    relationship intangible assets in conjunction with this
    transaction.

Discontinued
    operations

Education lending.

In September 2009, we decided
    to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business. As
    a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business
    as a discontinued operation.

The changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the
    education loan securitization trusts (discussed later in this
    Note) and the interest income and expense from the loans and the
    securities of the trusts are all recorded as a component of
    “income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of
    taxes” on the income statement. These amounts are shown
    separately in the following table. Gains and losses attributable
    to changes in fair value are recorded as a component of
    noninterest income or expense. It is our policy to recognize
    interest income and expense related to the loans and securities
    separately from changes in fair value. These amounts are shown
    as a component of “Net interest income.”

The components of “income (loss) from discontinued
    operations, net of taxes” for the education lending
    business are as follows:

In the past, as part of our education lending business model, we
    originated and securitized education loans. The process of
    securitization involves taking a pool of loans from our balance
    sheet and selling them to a bankruptcy remote QSPE, or trust.
    This trust then issues securities to investors in the capital
    markets to raise funds to pay for the loans. The interest
    generated on the loans goes to pay holders of the securities
    issued. As the transferor, we retain a portion of the risk in
    the form of a residual interest and also retain the right to
    service the securitized loans and receive servicing fees.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new consolidation accounting
    guidance that required us to analyze our existing QSPEs for
    possible consolidation. We determined that we should consolidate
    our ten outstanding securitization trusts as of January 1,
    2010, since we hold the residual interests and are the master
    servicer with the power to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the economic performance of these trusts.

The trust assets can be used only to settle the obligations or
    securities the trusts issue; we cannot sell the assets or
    transfer the liabilities. The loans in the consolidated trusts
    are comprised of both private and government-guaranteed loans.
    The security holders or beneficial interest holders do not have
    recourse to Key. Our economic interest or risk of loss
    associated with these education loan securitization trusts is
    approximately $173 million as of December 31, 2010. We
    record all income and expense (including fair value adjustments)
    through the “income (loss) from discontinued operations,
    net of tax” line item in our income statement.

We elected to consolidate these trusts at fair value when we
    prospectively adopted this new consolidation guidance. Carrying
    the assets and liabilities of the trusts at fair value better
    depicts our economic interest. A cumulative effect adjustment of
    approximately $45 million, which increased our beginning
    balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2010, was
    recorded when the trusts were consolidated. The amount of this
    cumulative effect adjustment was driven primarily by
    derecognizing the residual interests and servicing assets
    related to these trusts and consolidating the assets and
    liabilities at fair value.

At December 31, 2010, the primary economic assumptions used
    to measure the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the
    trusts are shown in the following table. The fair value is
    determined by calculating the present value of the future
    expected cash flows; those cash flows are affected by the
    following assumptions. We rely on unobservable inputs
    (Level 3) when determining the fair value of the
    assets and liabilities of the trusts because observable market
    data is not available.

    Activities”).

As described below, KeyCorp and KeyBank have a number of
    programs and facilities that support our short-term financing
    needs. In addition, certain subsidiaries maintain credit
    facilities with third parties, which provide alternative sources
    of funding in light of current market conditions. KeyCorp is the
    guarantor of some of the third-party facilities.

Bank note program.

KeyBank’s note
    program allows for the issuance of up to $20 billion of
    notes. These notes may have original maturities from thirty days
    up to thirty years. During 2010, KeyBank did not issue any notes
    under this program. At December 31, 2010,
    $16.5 billion was available for future issuance. Amounts
    outstanding under this program are classified as “long-term
    debt” on the balance sheet.

Euro medium-term note program.

Under our Euro
    medium-term note program, KeyCorp and KeyBank may, subject to
    the completion of certain filings, issue both long- and
    short-term debt of up to $10 billion in the aggregate
    ($9 billion by KeyBank and $1 billion by KeyCorp). The
    notes are offered exclusively to

non-U.S. investors,

and can be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign
    currencies. We did not issue any notes under this program during
    2010. At December 31, 2010, $8.9 billion was available
    for future issuance. Amounts outstanding under this program are
    classified as “long-term debt” on the balance sheet.

KeyCorp shelf registration, including medium-term note
    program.

In June 2008, KeyCorp filed an updated
    shelf registration statement with the SEC under rules that allow
    companies to register various types of debt and equity
    securities without limitations on the aggregate amounts
    available for issuance. During the same month, KeyCorp renewed a
    medium-term note program that permits KeyCorp to issue notes
    with original maturities of nine months or more. KeyCorp issued
    $750 million of medium-term fixed-rate senior notes during
    2010. This successful issuance demonstrates our ability to
    access the wholesale funding markets without an FDIC guarantee.
    At December 31, 2010, KeyCorp had authorized and available
    for issuance up to $1.5 billion of additional debt
    securities under the medium-term note program.

KeyCorp’s Board of Directors also authorized an equity
    shelf program pursuant to which we conduct

“at-the-market”

offerings of our Common Shares. This program serves as an
    available source of liquidity, subject to Board approval for
    future issuances of Common Shares and under the completion of
    certain supplemental SEC filings. On May 11, 2009, we
    commenced a public

“at-the-market”

offering of up to $750 million in aggregate gross proceeds
    of Common Shares. We subsequently increased the aggregate gross
    sales price of the Common Shares to be issued to $1 billion
    on June 2, 2009, and, on the same date, announced that we
    had successfully issued all $1 billion and successfully
    sold the full amount. Altogether, we issued
    205,438,975 shares at an average price of $4.87 per share
    and raised a total of $987 million in net proceeds.

KeyCorp also maintains a shelf registration for the issuance of
    capital securities or preferred stock, which serves as an
    additional source of liquidity. At December 31, 2010,
    KeyCorp had authorized and available for issuance up to
    $1.3 billion of preferred stock or capital securities.



Commercial paper.

KeyCorp has a commercial
    paper program that provides funding availability of up to
    $500 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, there
    were no borrowings outstanding under this program.

Other short-term credit facilities.

We
    maintain a large balance in our Federal Reserve account, which
    has reduced our need to obtain funds through various short-term
    unsecured money market products. This account and the unpledged
    securities in our investment portfolio provide a buffer to
    address unexpected short-term liquidity needs. We also have
    secured borrowing facilities at the Federal Home Loan Bank of
    Cincinnati and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to satisfy
    short-term liquidity requirements. As of December 31, 2010,
    our unused secured borrowing capacity was $11.3 billion at
    the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $4.0 billion at
    the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. Additionally, at
    December 31, 2010, we maintained a $418 million
    balance at the Federal Reserve.

16. Commitments,
    Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees

Obligations
    under Noncancelable Leases

We are obligated under various noncancelable operating leases
    for land, buildings and other property, consisting principally
    of data processing equipment. Rental expense under all operating
    leases totaled $124 million in 2010, $119 million in
    2009 and $121 million in 2008. Minimum future rental
    payments under noncancelable operating leases at
    December 31, 2010, are as follows: 2011 —
    $116 million; 2012 — $107 million;
    2013 — $102 million; 2014 —
    $95 million; 2015 — $88 million; all
    subsequent years — $314 million.

Commitments
    to Extend Credit or Funding

Loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as
    long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. These
    agreements generally carry variable rates of interest and have
    fixed expiration dates or termination clauses. We typically
    charge a fee for our loan commitments. Since a commitment may
    expire without resulting in a loan, our aggregate outstanding
    commitments may significantly exceed our eventual cash outlay.

Loan commitments involve credit risk not reflected on our
    balance sheet. We mitigate exposure to credit risk with internal
    controls that guide how we review and approve applications for
    credit, establish credit limits and, when necessary, demand
    collateral. In particular, we evaluate the creditworthiness of
    each prospective borrower on a

case-by-case

basis and, when appropriate, adjust the allowance for credit
    losses on lending-related commitments. Additional information
    pertaining to this allowance is included in Note 1
    (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under
    the heading “Liability for Credit Losses on Lending-Related
    Commitments” and Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).

The following table shows the remaining contractual amount of
    each class of commitment related to extending credit or funding
    principal investments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. For
    loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount



represents our maximum possible accounting loss if the borrower
    were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and
    subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the
    outstanding loan.

Legal
    Proceedings

Shareholder derivative matter.

As previously
    reported, certain current and former directors and executive
    officers of KeyCorp, and KeyCorp as a nominal defendant, were
    named as defendants in four shareholder derivative lawsuits
    filed, in the third quarter of 2010, in the Cuyahoga County
    Court of Common Pleas (“Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court”)
    and the United States District Court for the Northern District
    of Ohio (“Ohio Federal Court”). The original action,
    filed in Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court, styled James T.
    King, Jr., et al., v. Henry L. Meyer III et al.
    (“King”), alleges that the KeyCorp defendants violated
    their fiduciary duties, including their duties of candor, good
    faith and loyalty, and are liable for corporate waste and unjust
    enrichment in connection with 2009 executive compensation
    decisions. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages
    from the KeyCorp defendants, various forms of equitable

and/or

injunctive relief, and attorneys’ and other professional
    fees and costs. KeyCorp was also named as a nominal defendant in
    the lawsuit, but no damages are being sought from it.

In August 2010, three additional shareholder derivative actions
    were filed in Ohio Federal Court styled: Irving Lassoff, et
    al., v. KeyCorp, et al. (“Lassoff”); Warren
    Monday, et al., v. KeyCorp, et al. (“Monday”);
    and William Kaplan, et al., v. KeyCorp, et al.
    (“Kaplan”). These actions are similar to King;
    asserting similar causes of action and seeking similar remedies
    from certain current and former directors and executive officers
    of KeyCorp, and also each name KeyCorp as a nominal defendant.
    Lassoff asserts an additional cause of action based upon an
    alleged violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, asserting that our proxy statement contained
    alleged materially false and misleading statements. Monday and
    Kaplan each assert additional allegations and a cause of action
    for violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934,
    as amended, and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder relating to the propriety of our
    leveraged leasing transactions. Specifically, the Monday and
    Kaplan plaintiffs challenge our disclosures and accounting for
    such transactions, and assert that such transactions created
    unnecessary risk incentives resulting in the payment of
    excessive compensation. Plaintiffs in Kaplan and Monday seek
    relief from the individual defendants, on behalf of KeyCorp,
    including restitution and disgorgement of profits, benefits and
    compensation; return of executive compensation based upon
    allegedly materially inaccurate financial statements; reasonable
    fees and expenses; and an order directing us to reform our
    corporate governance procedures.

The King and Lassoff cases have been substantively consolidated
    with each other and are proceeding styled In re: KeyCorp
    Derivative Litigation in Ohio Federal Court, and the Monday and
    Kaplan cases have been substantively consolidated with each
    other and are proceeding styled Warren Monday, et al., v.
    KeyCorp, et al. As previously reported, KeyCorp’s Board of
    Directors has appointed two special committees of independent,
    nonmanagement directors to assess its executive compensation
    practices and to investigate the allegations made in these
    matters, and the committees have retained an independent law
    firm to assist in their investigation.

Taylor litigation.

As previously reported, in
    the third quarter of 2008, KeyCorp and certain of our directors
    and employees, were named as defendants in two putative class
    actions filed in the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of Ohio styled: Taylor v. KeyCorp, et al.
    (“Taylor”), and Wildes v. KeyCorp, et al. The
    plaintiffs in these cases seek to represent a class of all
    participants in our 401(k) Savings Plan and allege that the
    defendants in the lawsuit breached fiduciary duties owed to them
    under ERISA. These cases have been substantively consolidated
    with each other and are proceeding styled Taylor v.
    KeyCorp, et al. Plaintiffs’ consolidated complaint
    continues to name certain employees as defendants but no longer
    names any outside directors. Following briefing and argument on
    our motion to dismiss for, among other things, failure to make a
    demand on the board of directors, the Court dismissed Taylor on
    August 12, 2010. As previously reported, Plaintiffs filed a
    Notice of Appeal, and we filed a Cross-Appeal, both of which
    remain pending. Following the Court’s dismissal of Taylor,
    two putative



class action cases with similar allegations and causes of action
    were filed on September 21, 2010 in the same district
    court; these actions are styled Anthony Lobasso, et al., v.
    KeyCorp, et al. (“Lobasso”), and Thomas J. Metyk, et
    al., v. KeyCorp, et al. (“Metyk”). The Metyk and
    Lobasso lawsuits were substantively consolidated with each other
    and are proceeding styled Thomas J. Metyk, et al., v.
    KeyCorp, et al. We strongly disagree with the allegations
    asserted against us in these actions, and intend to vigorously
    defend against them.

Madoff-related claims.

As previously
    reported, Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing
    hedge fund investments for institutional customers, determined
    that its funds had suffered investment losses of up to
    approximately $186 million resulting from the crimes
    perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff and entities that he
    controlled. The investment losses borne by Austin’s clients
    stem from investments that Austin made in certain Madoff-advised
    “hedge” funds. Several lawsuits, including putative
    class actions and direct actions, and one arbitration proceeding
    were filed against Austin seeking to recover losses incurred as
    a result of Madoff’s crimes. The lawsuits and arbitration
    proceeding allege various claims, including negligence, fraud,
    breach of fiduciary duties, and violations of federal securities
    laws and ERISA. As previously reported, the arbitration
    proceeding remains in abeyance while Austin’s operations
    are wound down. The lawsuits were consolidated into one action
    styled In re Austin Capital Management, LTD.,
    Securities & Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) Litigation.

Although the Madoff and Taylor matters are claims made under the
    same policy year, based upon the information available to us,
    including the advice of counsel, we believe that in the event we
    were to incur any liability for these matters, that it should be
    covered under the terms and conditions of our insurance policy,
    subject to a $25 million self-insurance deductible and
    usual policy exceptions.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down Austin’s operations
    and have determined that the related exit costs will not be
    material. Information regarding the Austin discontinued
    operations is included in Note 13 (“Acquisition,
    Divestiture and Discontinued Operations”).

Checking Account Overdraft
    Litigation.

KeyBank was named a defendant in the
    proceeding styled David M. Johnson, individually and on behalf
    of all others similarly situated v. KeyBank National
    Association (“Johnson”) filed in the United States
    District Court for the Western District of Washington. Johnson
    is a putative class action seeking to represent a national class
    of KeyBank customers allegedly harmed by KeyBank’s
    overdraft practices. The complaint alleges that KeyBank unfairly
    manipulates customer transactions to maximize the number of
    overdraft charges. The claims asserted against KeyBank include
    breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair
    dealing, common law unconscionability, conversion, unjust
    enrichment and violation of the Washington Consumer Protection
    Act. Plaintiffs seek restitution and disgorgement, damages,
    expenses of litigation, attorneys’ fees, and other relief
    deemed equitable by the court. The case was transferred and
    consolidated for purposes of pretrial discovery and motion
    proceedings to a multidistrict proceeding styled In Re: Checking
    Account Overdraft Litigation pending in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Florida. KeyBank
    filed a motion to compel arbitration which the court denied.
    KeyBank subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the United
    States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in regard to
    the denial of the motion. The case is currently stayed as to
    KeyBank pending the appeal. At this stage of the proceedings it
    is too early to determine if the matter would reasonably be
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition.

Other litigation.

In the ordinary course of
    business, we are subject to other legal actions that involve
    claims for substantial monetary relief. Based on information
    presently known to us, we do not believe there is any legal
    action to which we are a party, or involving any of our
    properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would
    reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition.

Guarantees

We are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. The
    following table shows the types of guarantees that we had
    outstanding at December 31, 2010. Information pertaining to
    the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection
    with these guarantees is included in Note 1 under the
    heading “Guarantees.”

The maximum potential undiscounted

    qualifying as guarantees.



We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each
    type of guarantee described below based on the probability that
    we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted
    future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of
    low (0-30% probability of payment), moderate

(31-70%

probability of payment) or high

(71-100%

probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk,
    and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated
    with each type of guarantee outstanding at December 31,
    2010 is low.

Standby letters of credit.

KeyBank issues
    standby letters of credit to address clients’ financing
    needs. These instruments obligate us to pay a specified third
    party when a client fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt
    instrument or fails to perform some contractual nonfinancial
    obligation. Any amounts drawn under standby letters of credit
    are treated as loans to the client; they bear interest
    (generally at variable rates) and pose the same credit risk to
    us as a loan. At December 31, 2010, our standby letters of
    credit had a remaining weighted-average life of 1.9 years,
    with remaining actual lives ranging from less than one year to
    as many as eight years.

Recourse agreement with FNMA.

We participate
    as a lender in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing
    program. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating,
    underwriting and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited
    portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each
    commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a
    reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe
    approximates the fair value of our liability. At
    December 31, 2010, the outstanding commercial mortgage
    loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of
    5.9 years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of
    loans sold by us as a participant was $2.3 billion. As
    shown in the preceding table, the maximum potential amount of
    undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make
    under this program is equal to approximately one-third of the
    principal balance of loans outstanding at December 31,
    2010. If we are required to make a payment, we would have an
    interest in the collateral underlying the related commercial
    mortgage loan. Therefore, any loss incurred could be offset by
    the amount of any recovery from the collateral.

Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC
    investors.

KAHC, a subsidiary of KeyBank, offered
    limited partnership interests to qualified investors.
    Partnerships formed by KAHC invested in low-income residential
    rental properties that qualify for federal low income housing
    tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    In certain partnerships, investors paid a fee to KAHC for a
    guaranteed return that is based on the financial performance of
    the property and the property’s confirmed LIHTC status
    throughout a fifteen-year compliance period. Typically, KAHC
    provides these guaranteed returns by distributing tax credits
    and deductions associated with the specific properties. If KAHC
    defaults on its obligation to provide the guaranteed return,
    KeyBank is obligated to make any necessary payments to
    investors. No recourse or collateral is available to offset our
    guarantee obligation other than the underlying income stream
    from the properties and the residual value of the operating
    partnership interests.

As shown in the previous table, KAHC maintained a reserve in the
    amount of $58 million at December 31, 2010, which we
    believe will be sufficient to cover estimated future obligations
    under the guarantees. The maximum exposure to loss reflected in
    the table represents undiscounted future payments due to
    investors for the return on and of their investments.

These guarantees have expiration dates that extend through 2019,
    but KAHC has not formed any new partnerships under this program
    since October 2003. Additional information regarding these
    partnerships is included in Note 11 (“Variable
    Interest Entities”).

Written put options.

In the ordinary course
    of business, we “write” interest rate caps and floors
    for commercial loan clients that have variable and fixed rate
    loans, respectively, with us and wish to mitigate their exposure
    to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, our
    written put options had an average life of 1.3 years. These
    instruments are considered to be guarantees as we are required
    to make payments to the counterparty (the commercial loan
    client) based on changes in an underlying variable that is
    related to an asset, a liability or an equity security held by
    the guaranteed party (i.e., the commercial loan client). We are
    obligated to pay the client if the applicable benchmark interest
    rate is above or below a specified level (known as the
    “strike rate”). These written put options are
    accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed
    in Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).
    We typically mitigate our potential future payments by entering
    into offsetting positions with third parties.

Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or
    bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not
    considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do
    not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a
    purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further
    discussed in Note 8.

Default guarantees.

Some lines of business
    participate in guarantees that obligate us to perform if the
    debtor (typically a client) fails to satisfy all of its payment
    obligations to third parties. We generally undertake these
    guarantees for one of two possible reasons: either the risk
    profile of the debtor should provide an investment return, or we
    are supporting our underlying investment. The terms of these
    default guarantees range from less than one year to as many as
    eight years; some default guarantees do not have a contractual
    end date. Although no collateral is held, we would receive a pro
    rata share should the third party collect some or all of the
    amounts due from the debtor.



Other
    Off-Balance Sheet Risk

Other off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments
    that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in
    the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships.

Liquidity facilities that support asset-backed commercial
    paper conduits.

At December 31, 2010, we had
    one liquidity facility remaining outstanding with an
    unconsolidated third-party commercial paper conduit. This
    liquidity facility, which will expire by May 15, 2013,
    obligates us to provide aggregate funding of up to
    $51 million in the event that a credit market disruption or
    other factors prevent the conduit from issuing commercial paper.
    The aggregate amount available to be drawn which is based on the
    amount of the conduit’s current commitments to borrowers
    totaled $24 million at December 31, 2010. We
    periodically evaluate our commitment to provide liquidity.

Indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of
    business.

We provide certain indemnifications,
    primarily through representations and warranties in contracts
    that we execute in the ordinary course of business in connection
    with loan sales and other ongoing activities, as well as in
    connection with purchases and sales of businesses. We maintain
    reserves, when appropriate, with respect to liability that
    reasonably could arise as a result of these indemnities.

Intercompany guarantees.

KeyCorp and certain
    of our affiliates are parties to various guarantees that
    facilitate the ongoing business activities of other affiliates.
    These business activities encompass issuing debt, assuming
    certain lease and insurance obligations, purchasing or issuing
    investments and securities, and engaging in certain leasing
    transactions involving clients.

17. Capital
    Securities Issued by Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

We own the outstanding common stock of business trusts formed by
    us that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable
    preferred capital securities. The trusts used the proceeds from
    the issuance of their capital securities and common stock to buy
    debentures issued by KeyCorp. These debentures are the
    trusts’ only assets; the interest payments from the
    debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily
    redeemable preferred capital securities.

We unconditionally guarantee the following payments or
    distributions on behalf of the trusts:

♦

required distributions on the capital securities;

♦

the redemption price when a capital security is
    redeemed; and

♦

the amounts due if a trust is liquidated or terminated.

Our mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities provide
    an attractive source of funds; they currently constitute
    Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes, but have
    the same federal tax advantages as debt.

In 2005, the Federal Reserve adopted a rule that allows BHCs to
    continue to treat capital securities as Tier 1 capital but
    imposed stricter quantitative limits that were to take effect
    March 31, 2009. However, in light of continued stress in
    the financial markets, the Federal Reserve later delayed the
    effective date of these new limits until March 31, 2011. We
    believe this rule will not have any material effect on our
    financial condition.

The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory
    capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing-out the
    treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred
    securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued to the
    United States or its agencies or instrumentalities before
    October 4, 2010) as Tier 1 eligible capital. This
    three-year phase-out period, which commences January 1,
    2013, ultimately will result in our mandatorily redeemable
    preferred capital securities being treated only as Tier 2
    capital. Generally speaking, these changes take the leverage and
    risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository
    institutions and apply them to BHCs, savings and loan companies,
    and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically
    important. The Federal Reserve has 180 days from the
    enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act to issue the relevant
    regulations. We anticipate that the rulemaking will provide
    additional clarity to the regulatory capital guidelines
    applicable to BHCs such as Key.

As of December 31, 2010, the capital securities issued by
    the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts represent
    $1.8 billion or 15% of our Tier 1 capital.

18. Stock-Based
    Compensation

We maintain several stock-based compensation plans, which are
    described below. Total compensation expense for these plans was
    $55 million for 2010, $54 million for 2009 and
    $49 million for 2008. The total income tax benefit
    recognized in the income statement for these plans was
    $21 million for 2010, $20 million for 2009 and
    $19 million for 2008. Stock-based compensation expense
    related to awards granted to employees is recorded in
    “personnel expense” on the income statement;
    compensation expense related to awards granted to directors is
    recorded in “other expense.”



Our compensation plans allow us to grant stock options,
    restricted stock, performance shares, discounted stock purchases
    and deferred compensation to eligible employees and directors.
    At December 31, 2010, we had 43,022,983 Common Shares
    available for future grant under our compensation plans. In
    accordance with a resolution adopted by the Compensation and
    Organization Committee of Key’s Board of Directors, we may
    not grant options to purchase Common Shares, restricted stock or
    other shares under any long-term compensation plan in an
    aggregate amount that exceeds 6% of our outstanding Common
    Shares in any rolling three-year period.

Stock
    Option Plans

Stock options granted to employees generally become exercisable
    at the rate of


/


%
    per year beginning one year from their grant date; options
    expire no later than ten years from their grant date. The
    exercise price is the average of the high and low price of our
    common shares on the date of grant, and cannot be less than the
    fair market value of our Common Shares on the grant date.

We determine the fair value of options granted using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model was originally
    developed to determine the fair value of exchange-traded equity
    options, which (unlike employee stock options) have no vesting
    period or transferability restrictions. Because of these
    differences, the Black-Scholes model does not precisely value an
    employee stock option, but it is commonly used for this purpose.
    The model assumes that the estimated fair value of an option is
    amortized as compensation expense over the option’s vesting
    period.

The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions, which we
    developed and update based on historical trends and current
    market observations. Our determination of the fair value of
    options is only as accurate as the underlying assumptions. The
    assumptions pertaining to options issued during 2010, 2009 and
    2008 are shown in the following table.

The intrinsic value of a stock
    option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying
    stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options was $3.71
    for options granted during 2010, $2.37 for options granted
    during 2009 and $1.78 for options granted during 2008. During
    2010, 79,786 stock options were exercised. No options were
    exercised during 2009. The aggregate intrinsic value of
    exercised options for 2010 and 2008 was $.2 million and
    $2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010,
    unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options
    expected to vest under the plans totaled $9 million. We
    expect to recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of
    2.2 years.

Cash received from options exercised for 2010 and 2008 was
    $.4 million and $6 million, respectively. The actual
    tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from options
    exercised totaled $.1 million for 2010 and $.3 million
    for 2008.

Long-Term
    Incentive Compensation Program

Our Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program rewards senior
    executives critical to our long-term financial success; and
    covers three-year performance cycles, with a new cycle beginning
    each year. Awards are granted in a variety of forms:

♦

deferred cash payments;

♦

time-lapsed restricted stock, which generally vests after the
    end of the three-year cycle for which it was granted;



♦

performance-based restricted stock, which will not vest unless
    Key attains defined performance levels; and

♦

performance shares payable in stock, which will not vest unless
    Key attains defined performance levels.

During 2010 and 2009, we did not pay cash awards in connection
    with vested performance shares. During 2008, we paid cash awards
    in connection with vested performance shares of $1 million.

The following table summarizes activity and pricing information

The compensation cost of time-lapsed and performance-based
    restricted stock awards granted under the Program is calculated
    using the closing trading price of our common shares on the
    grant date.

Unlike time-lapsed and performance-based restricted stock,
    performance shares payable in stock and those payable in cash
    for exceeding targeted performance do not pay dividends during
    the vesting period. Consequently, the fair value of these awards
    is calculated by reducing the share price at the date of grant
    by the present value of estimated future dividends forgone
    during the vesting period, discounted at an appropriate
    risk-free interest rate.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of awards granted
    under this program was $6.74 during 2010, $6.56 during 2009 and
    $22.81 during 2008. As of December 31, 2010, unrecognized
    compensation cost related to nonvested shares expected to vest
    under the Program totaled $8 million. We expect to
    recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of
    1.8 years. The total fair value of shares vested was
    $7 million during 2010, $2 million during 2009 and
    $9 million during 2008.

Other
    Restricted Stock Awards

We also may grant, upon approval by the Compensation and
    Organization Committee, other time-lapsed restricted stock
    awards under various programs to recognize outstanding
    performance. At December 31, 2010, the majority of the
    nonvested shares shown in the table below relate to February
    2010, March 2009 and July 2008 grants of time-lapsed restricted
    stock to qualifying executives and 3,570,078 grants to certain
    other employees identified as high performers. These awards
    generally vest after three years of service.

    awards for the year ended December 31, 2010.

    of December 31, 2010, unrecognized compensation cost
    related to nonvested restricted stock expected to vest under
    these special awards totaled $17 million. We expect to
    recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of
    1.5 years. The total fair value of restricted stock vested
    was $23 million during 2010, $3 million during 2009,
    and $2 million during 2008.



Deferred
    Compensation Plans

Our deferred compensation arrangements include voluntary and
    mandatory deferral programs for Common Shares awarded to certain
    employees and directors. Mandatory deferred incentive awards,
    together with a 15% employer matching contribution, vest at the
    rate of


/


%
    per year beginning one year after the deferral date. Deferrals
    under the voluntary programs are immediately vested, except for
    any employer match, which generally will vest after three years
    of service. The voluntary deferral programs provide an employer
    match ranging from 6% to 15% of the deferral.

Several of our deferred compensation arrangements allow
    participants to redirect deferrals from Common Shares into other
    investments that provide for distributions payable in cash. We
    account for these participant-directed deferred compensation
    arrangements as stock-based liabilities and re-measure the
    related compensation cost based on the most recent fair value of
    our Common Shares. The compensation cost of all other
    nonparticipant-directed deferrals is measured based on the
    average of the high and low trading price of our Common Shares
    on the deferral date. We did not pay any stock-based liabilities
    during 2010, 2009 or 2008.

The following table summarizes activity and pricing information
    for the nonvested shares in our deferred compensation plans for

    related to nonvested shares expected to vest under our deferred
    compensation plans totaled $3 million. We expect to
    recognize this cost over a weighted-average period of

    $15 million during 2008. Dividend equivalents presented in
    the preceding table represent the value of dividends accumulated
    during the vesting period.

Discounted
    Stock Purchase Plan

Our Discounted Stock Purchase Plan provides employees the
    opportunity to purchase our Common Shares at a 10% discount
    through payroll deductions or cash payments. Purchases are
    limited to $10,000 in any month and $50,000 in any calendar
    year, and are immediately vested. To accommodate employee
    purchases, we acquire shares on the open market on or around the
    fifteenth day of the month following the month employee payments
    are received. We issued 241,445 shares at a
    weighted-average cost of $7.69 during 2010, 371,417 shares
    at a weighted-average cost of $6.31 during 2009 and
    337,544 shares at a weighted-average cost of $13.77 during
    2008.

Information pertaining to our method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation is included in Note 1
    (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under
    the heading “Stock-Based Compensation.”

19. Employee
    Benefits

In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for
    defined benefit and other postretirement plans, we measure plan
    assets and liabilities as of the end of the fiscal year.

Pension
    Plans

Effective December 31, 2009, we amended our pension plans
    to freeze all benefit accruals and close the plans to new
    employees. We will continue to credit participants’
    existing account balances for interest until they receive their
    plan benefits. We changed certain pension plan assumptions as a
    result of freezing the pension plans.

Pre-tax AOCI not yet recognized as net pension cost was
    $525 million at December 31, 2010, and
    $483 million at December 31, 2009, consisting entirely
    of net unrecognized losses. During 2011, we expect to recognize
    $11 million of net unrecognized losses in pre-tax AOCI as
    net pension cost.



The components of net pension cost and the amount recognized in
    OCI for all funded and unfunded plans are as follows:

At December 31, 2010, our primary qualified cash balance
    pension plan was sufficiently funded under the requirements of
    ERISA. Consequently, we are not required to make a minimum
    contribution to that plan in 2011. However, we expect to make
    discretionary contributions of $100 million during 2011.

At December 31, 2010, we expect to pay the benefits from
    all funded and unfunded pension plans as follows:
    2011 — $110 million; 2012 —
    $107 million; 2013 — $103 million;
    2014 — $98 million; 2015 —
    $94 million; and $429 million in the aggregate from
    2016 through 2020.

The ABO for all of our pension plans was $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. As indicated in the table
    below, all of our plans had an ABO in excess of plan assets as

We estimate that we will recognize a $13 million credit in
    net pension cost for 2011, compared to zero for 2010 and a
    $91 million expense for 2009. Costs will continue to
    decline in 2011 as plan assets increase due to our contributions
    and assumed market-related gains. Costs declined in 2010
    primarily because we amended all pension plans to freeze
    benefits effective December 31, 2009, and as a result
    changed certain pension plan assumptions. The increase in 2009
    cost was due primarily to a rise in the amortization of losses.
    Those losses stemmed largely from a decrease in the value of
    plan assets in 2008 due to steep declines in the capital
    markets, particularly the equity markets, coupled with a
    50 basis point decrease in the assumed expected return on
    assets.

We determine the expected return on plan assets using a
    calculated market-related value of plan assets that smoothes
    what might otherwise be significant

year-to-year

volatility in net pension cost. Changes in the value of plan
    assets are not recognized in the year they occur. Rather, they
    are combined with any other cumulative unrecognized asset- and
    obligation-related gains and losses, and are reflected evenly in
    the market-related value during the five years after they occur
    as long as the market-related value does not vary more than 10%
    from the plan’s FVA.

We estimate that a 25 basis point increase or decrease in
    the expected return on plan assets would either decrease or
    increase, respectively, our net pension cost for 2011 by
    approximately $3 million. Pension cost is also affected by
    an assumed discount rate. We estimate that a 25 basis point
    change in the assumed discount rate would change net pension
    cost for 2011 by approximately $1 million.



We determine the assumed discount rate based on the rate of
    return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate
    bonds with interest rates and maturities that provide the
    necessary cash flows to pay benefits when due.

The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering
    a number of factors, the most significant of which are:

♦

Our expectations for returns on plan assets over the long term,
    weighted for the investment mix of the assets. These
    expectations consider, among other factors, historical capital
    market returns of equity, fixed income, convertible and other
    securities, and forecasted returns that are modeled under
    various economic scenarios.

♦

Historical returns on our plan assets. Based on an annual
    reassessment of current and expected future capital market
    returns, our expected return on plan assets was 8.25% for 2010
    and 2009, compared to 8.75% for 2008. However, as part of an
    annual reassessment of current and expected future capital
    market returns, we deemed a rate of 7.75% to be more appropriate
    in estimating 2011 pension cost. This change will increase
    2011 net pension cost by approximately $5 million.

The investment objectives of the pension funds are developed to
    reflect the characteristics of the plans, such as pension
    formulas and cash lump sum distribution features, and the
    liability profiles created by the plans’ participants. An
    executive oversight committee reviews the plans’ investment
    performance at least quarterly, and compares performance against
    appropriate market indices. The pension funds’ investment
    objectives are to achieve an annualized rate of return equal to
    or greater than our expected return on plan assets over ten to
    twenty-year periods; to realize annual and three- and five-year
    annualized rates of return consistent with specific market
    benchmarks at the individual asset class level; and to maximize
    ten to twenty-year annualized rates of return while maintaining
    prudent levels of risk, consistent with our asset allocation
    policy. The following table shows the asset target allocations
    prescribed by the pension funds’ investment policies.

Equity securities include common stocks of domestic and foreign
    companies, as well as foreign company stocks traded as American
    Depositary Shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Fixed income
    securities include investments in domestic- and foreign-issued
    corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency bonds,
    international government bonds, and mutual funds. Convertible
    securities include investments in convertible bonds. Other
    assets include deposits under insurance company contracts and an
    investment in a multi-manager, multi-strategy investment fund.

Although the pension funds’ investment policies
    conditionally permit the use of derivative contracts, we have
    not entered into any such contracts, and we do not expect to
    employ such contracts in the future.

The valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of
    pension plan assets vary depending on the type of asset, as
    described below. For an explanation of the fair value hierarchy,
    see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value
    Measurements.”

Equity securities.

Equity securities traded
    on securities exchanges are valued at the closing price on the
    exchange or system where the security is principally traded.
    These securities are classified as Level 1 since quoted
    prices for identical securities in active markets are available.

Debt securities.

Substantially all debt
    securities are investment grade and include domestic- and
    foreign-issued corporate bonds and U.S. government and
    agency bonds. These securities are valued using evaluated prices
    provided by Interactive Data, a third-party valuation service.
    Because the evaluated prices are based on observable inputs,
    such as dealer quotes, available trade information, spreads,
    bids and offers, prepayment speeds, U.S. Treasury curves
    and interest rate movements, securities in this category are
    classified as Level 2.

Mutual funds.

Investments in mutual funds are
    valued at their closing net asset values. Exchange-traded mutual
    funds are valued at the closing price on the exchange or system
    where the security is principally traded. These securities
    generally are classified as Level 1 since quoted prices for
    identical securities in active markets are available.

Common trust funds.

Investments in common
    trust funds are valued at their closing net asset values.
    Because net asset values are based primarily on observable
    inputs, most notably quoted prices of similar assets, these
    investments are classified as Level 2.

Insurance company contracts.

Deposits under
    insurance company contracts are valued by the insurance
    companies. Because these valuations are determined using a
    significant number of unobservable inputs, these investments are
    classified as Level 3.



Multi-strategy investment funds.

Investments
    in investment funds are valued by the investment managers of the
    funds based on the fair value of a fund’s underlying
    investments. Because this valuation is determined using a
    significant number of unobservable inputs, investments in
    investment funds are classified as Level 3.

    assets by asset category at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plans

We sponsor a contributory postretirement healthcare plan that
    covers substantially all active and retired employees hired
    before 2001 who meet certain eligibility criteria.
    Retirees’ contributions are adjusted annually to reflect
    certain cost-sharing provisions and benefit limitations. We also
    sponsor a death benefit plan covering certain grandfathered
    employees; the plan is noncontributory. We use separate VEBA
    trusts to fund the healthcare plan and the death benefit plan.

There are no regulations that require contributions to the VEBA
    trusts that fund some of our benefit plans. Consequently, there
    is no minimum funding requirement. We are permitted to make
    discretionary contributions to the VEBA trusts, subject to
    certain IRS restrictions and limitations. We anticipate that our
    discretionary contributions in 2011, if any, will be minimal.

At December 31, 2010, we expect to pay the benefits from
    all funded and unfunded other postretirement plans as follows:
    2011 — $6 million; 2012 —
    $6 million; 2013 — $6 million;
    2014 — $6 million; 2015 —
    $6 million; and $28 million in the aggregate from 2016
    through 2020.

To determine the APBO, we assumed weighted-average discount
    rates of 4.75% at December 31, 2010 and 5.25% at
    December 31, 2009.

To determine net postretirement benefit cost, we assumed the
    following weighted-average rates.

The realized net investment income for the postretirement
    healthcare plan VEBA trust is subject to federal income taxes,
    which are reflected in the weighted-average expected return on
    plan assets shown above.



Our assumptions regarding healthcare cost trend rates are as
    follows:

Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline

5.00

5.00

Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate



Increasing or decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate
    by one percentage point each future year would not have a
    material impact on net postretirement benefit cost or
    obligations since the postretirement plans have cost-sharing
    provisions and benefit limitations.

We estimate that our net postretirement benefit cost for 2011
    will amount to less than $1 million, compared to a cost of
    less than $1 million for 2010 and $1 million for 2009.

We estimate the expected returns on plan assets for VEBA trusts
    much the same way we estimate returns on our pension funds. The
    primary investment objectives of the VEBA trusts are to obtain a
    market rate of return and to diversify the portfolios so they
    can satisfy the trusts’ anticipated liquidity requirements.
    The following table shows the asset target allocation ranges
    prescribed by the trusts’ investment policies.

    similar assets, these investments are classified as Level 2.

Although the VEBA trusts’ investment policies conditionally
    permit the use of derivative contracts, we have not entered into
    any such contracts, and we do not expect to employ such
    contracts in the future.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
    Act of 2003 introduced a prescription drug benefit under
    Medicare, and prescribes a federal subsidy to sponsors of
    retiree healthcare benefit plans that offer “actuarially
    equivalent” prescription drug coverage to retirees. Based
    on our application of the relevant regulatory formula, we expect
    that the prescription drug coverage related to our retiree
    healthcare benefit plan will not be actuarially equivalent to
    the Medicare benefit for the vast majority of retirees. For the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, these
    subsidies did not have a material effect on our APBO and net
    postretirement benefit cost.

The “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” and
    “Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,” which were
    signed into law on March 23, 2010 and March 30, 2010,
    respectively, changed the tax treatment of federal subsidies
    paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a
    benefit that is at least “actuarially equivalent” to
    the benefits under Medicare Part D. As a result of these
    laws, these subsidy payments become taxable in tax years
    beginning after December 31, 2012. The accounting guidance
    applicable to income taxes requires the impact of a change in
    tax law to be immediately recognized in the period that includes
    the enactment date. The changes to the tax law as a result of
    the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” and
    “Education Reconciliation Act of 2010” did not impact
    us as we did not have a deferred tax asset recorded as a result
    of Medicare Part D subsidies received.

Employee
    401(k) Savings Plan

A substantial number of our employees are covered under a
    savings plan that is qualified under Section 401(k) of the
    Internal Revenue Code. The plan permits employees to contribute
    from 1% to 25% of eligible compensation, with up to 6% being
    eligible for matching contributions in the form of KeyCorp
    Common Shares. The plan also permits us to distribute a
    discretionary profit-sharing component, which was 3% for 2010
    for eligible employees as of December 31, 2010. We also
    maintain a deferred savings plan that provides certain employees
    with benefits that they otherwise would not have been eligible
    to receive under the qualified plan because of IRS contribution
    limits. Total expense associated with the above plans was
    $75 million in 2010, $44 million in 2009, and
    $51 million in 2008. We have committed to a 3%
    profit-sharing allocation for 2011 for eligible employees as of
    December 31, 2011.

20. Shareholders’
    Equity

Cumulative
    Effect Adjustment (after-tax)

Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation
    accounting guidance. As a result of adopting this new guidance,
    we consolidated our education loan securitization trusts
    (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities). That
    consolidation added $2.8 billion in assets, liabilities and
    equity to our balance sheet and resulted in a cumulative effect
    adjustment (after-tax) of $45 million to beginning retained
    earnings on January 1, 2010. Additional information
    regarding this new accounting guidance and the consolidation of
    these education loan securitization trusts is provided in
    Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies”) and Note 13 (“Acquisition, Divestiture
    and Discontinued Operations”).

We did not undertake any new capital generating activities
    during 2010. Note 15 (“Shareholders’
    Equity”) on page 107 of our 2009 Annual Report to
    Shareholders provides information regarding our capital
    generating activities in 2009.

Common
    Stock Warrant

During 2008, in conjunction with our participation in the CPP,
    we granted a warrant to purchase 35,244,361 common shares to the
    U.S. Treasury, which we recorded at a fair value of
    $87 million. The warrant gives the U.S. Treasury the
    option to purchase common shares at an exercise price of $10.64
    per share. The warrant has a term of ten years, is immediately
    exercisable, in whole or in part, and is transferable. The
    U.S. Treasury has agreed not to exercise voting power with
    respect to any Common Shares we issue upon exercise of the
    Warrant.

Capital
    Adequacy

KeyCorp and KeyBank must meet specific capital requirements
    imposed by federal banking regulators. Sanctions for failure to
    meet applicable capital requirements may include regulatory
    enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments, require the
    adoption of remedial measures to increase capital, terminate
    FDIC deposit insurance, and mandate the appointment of a
    conservator or receiver in severe cases. In addition, failure to
    maintain a well-capitalized status affects how regulators
    evaluate applications for certain endeavors, including
    acquisitions, continuation and expansion of existing activities,
    and commencement of new activities are evaluated, and could make
    clients and potential investors less confident. As of
    December 31, 2010, KeyCorp and KeyBank met all regulatory
    capital requirements.

Federal banking regulators apply certain capital ratios to
    assign FDIC-insured depository institutions to one of five
    categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately
    capitalized,” “undercapitalized,”
    “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically
    undercapitalized.” KeyCorp’s affiliate bank, KeyBank,
    qualified as “well capitalized” at December 31,
    2010, since it exceeded the prescribed threshold ratios of
    10.00% for total risk-based capital, 6.00% for Tier 1
    risk-based capital, and 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital
    and was not subject to any written agreement, order or directive
    to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital



measure. We believe that there has not been any change in
    condition or event since that date that would cause
    KeyBank’s capital classification to change.

Bank holding companies are not assigned to any of the five
    capital categories applicable to insured depository
    institutions. However, if those categories applied to bank
    holding companies, we believe KeyCorp would satisfy the criteria
    for a “well capitalized” institution at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Federal Deposit Insurance
    Act-defined capital categories serve a limited regulatory
    function and may not accurately represent our overall financial
    condition or prospects.

The following table presents Key’s and KeyBank’s
    actual capital amounts and ratios, minimum capital amounts and
    ratios prescribed by regulatory guidelines, and capital amounts
    and ratios required to qualify as “well capitalized”
    under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

21. Line
    of Business Results

The specific lines of business that comprise each of the major
    business segments (operating segments) are described below.
    During the first quarter of 2010, we realigned the reporting
    structure for our business segments. Prior to 2010, Consumer
    Finance consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as
    exit or run-off portfolios and were included in our Key
    Corporate Bank segment. For all periods presented, we are
    reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other
    Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously
    included in Consumer Finance, has been realigned with the
    Commercial Banking line of business within the Key Community
    Bank segment. Our tuition processing business was moved from
    Consumer Finance to Global Treasury Management within the Real
    Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services. In addition,
    other previously identified exit portfolios included in the Key
    Corporate Bank have been moved to Other Segments.

    programs, succession planning, access to capital markets,
    derivatives and foreign exchange.

Key
    Corporate Bank

Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services

consists of two business units, Real Estate Capital and
    Corporate Banking Services.

Real Estate Capital is a national business that provides
    construction and interim lending, permanent debt placements and
    servicing, equity and investment banking, and other commercial
    banking products and services to developers, brokers and
    owner-investors. This unit deals primarily with
    nonowner-occupied properties (i.e., generally properties in
    which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental
    income from non-affiliated third parties).

Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest
    rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to
    clients served by Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.
    Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses,
    Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of
    commercial banking products and services to government and

not-for-profit

entities and to community banks. A variety of cash management
    services are provided through the Global Treasury Management
    unit.

Equipment Finance

meets the equipment leasing
    needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment
    manufacturers, distributors and resellers with financing options
    for their clients. Lease financing receivables and related
    revenues are assigned to other lines of business (primarily
    Institutional and Capital Markets, and Commercial Banking) if
    those businesses are principally responsible for maintaining the
    applicable client relationships.

Institutional and Capital Markets

through its
    KeyBanc Capital Markets unit, provides commercial lending,
    treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign
    exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and
    syndicated finance products and services to large corporations
    and middle-market companies.

Through its Victory Capital Management unit, Institutional and
    Capital Markets also manages or offers advice regarding
    investment portfolios for a national client base, including
    corporations, labor unions,

not-for-profit

organizations, governments and individuals. These portfolios may
    be managed in separate accounts, common funds or the Victory
    family of mutual funds.

Other
    Segments

Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, our Principal
    Investing unit and various exit portfolios that were previously
    included within Key Corporate Bank. These exit portfolios were
    moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 2010.

Reconciling
    Items

Total assets included under “Reconciling Items”
    primarily represent the unallocated portion of nonearning assets
    of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding
    of these assets are part of net interest income and are
    allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense.
    Reconciling Items also includes intercompany eliminations and
    certain items that are not allocated to the business segments
    because they do not reflect their normal operations.



The table on the following pages shows selected financial data
    for our two major business segments for December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008. This table is accompanied by supplementary
    information for each of the lines of business that make up these
    segments. The information was derived from the internal
    financial reporting system we use to monitor and manage our
    financial performance. GAAP guides financial accounting, but
    there is no authoritative guidance for “management
    accounting” — the way we use our judgment and
    experience to make reporting decisions. Consequently, the line
    of business results we report may not be comparable to line of
    business results presented by other companies.

The selected financial data are based on internal accounting
    policies designed to compile results on a consistent basis and
    in a manner that reflects the underlying economics of the
    businesses. In accordance with our policies:

♦

Net interest income is determined by assigning a standard cost
    for funds used or a standard credit for funds provided based on
    their assumed maturity, prepayment

and/or

repricing characteristics.

♦

Indirect expenses, such as computer servicing costs and
    corporate overhead, are allocated based on assumptions regarding
    the extent to which each line of business actually uses the
    services.

♦

The consolidated provision for loan and lease losses is
    allocated among the lines of business primarily based on their
    actual net charge-offs, adjusted periodically for loan growth
    and changes in risk profile. The amount of the consolidated
    provision is based on the methodology that we use to estimate
    our consolidated allowance for loan and lease losses. This
    methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading
    “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.”

♦

Income taxes are allocated based on the statutory federal income
    tax rate of 35% (adjusted for tax-exempt interest income, income
    from corporate-owned life insurance and tax credits associated
    with investments in low-income housing projects) and a blended
    state income tax rate (net of the federal income tax benefit) of
    2.2%.

♦

Capital is assigned based on our assessment of economic risk
    factors (primarily credit, operating and market risk) directly
    attributable to each line of business.

Developing and applying the methodologies that we use to
    allocate items among our lines of business is a dynamic process.
    Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to
    reflect accounting enhancements, changes in the risk profile of
    a particular business or changes in our organizational structure.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act), to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
    to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
    Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design
    and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period
    covered by this report.

    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in

    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial
    reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting, the Report of Independent Registered
    Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
