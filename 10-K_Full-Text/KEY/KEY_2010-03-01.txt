PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
    is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a bank holding
    company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and are one
    of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services
    companies, with consolidated total assets of $93.3 billion
    at December 31, 2009. KeyCorp is the parent holding company
    for KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”), its
    principal subsidiary, through which most of its banking services
    are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we
    provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking,
    commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance and
    investment banking products and services to individual,
    corporate and institutional clients through two major business
    groups, Community Banking and National Banking. As of
    December 31, 2009, these services were provided across the
    country through KeyBank’s 1,007 full-service retail banking
    branches in fourteen states, additional offices, a telephone
    banking call center services group and a network of 1,495
    automated teller machines (“ATMs”) in sixteen states.
    Additional information pertaining to KeyCorp’s two business
    groups is included in the “Line of Business Results”
    section and in Note 4 (“Line of Business
    Results”) of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2009 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto) and
    is incorporated herein by reference. KeyCorp and its
    subsidiaries had an average of 16,698 full-time equivalent
    employees for 2009.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
    deposits and making loans, our bank and trust company
    subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
    personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
    management services, investment banking and capital markets
    products, and international banking services. Through our
    subsidiary bank, trust company and registered investment adviser
    subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to
    clients that include large corporate and public retirement
    plans, foundations and endowments,

high-net-worth

individuals and multi-employer trust funds established for
    providing pension or other benefits to employees.

We provide other financial services — both within and
    outside of our primary banking markets — through
    various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include principal
    investing, community development financing, securities
    underwriting and brokerage, and merchant services. We also are
    an equity participant in a joint venture that provides merchant
    services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks
    and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
    security holders and its creditors to participate in any
    distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other
    subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the respective
    creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the
    extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as creditor of
    such banks and other subsidiaries may be recognized.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 3 (“Acquisitions and
    Divestitures”) of the Financial Review section of our 2009
    Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto) is
    incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
    competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
    compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
    holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
    credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
    mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms,
    investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local,
    regional and national



institutions that offer financial services. Key competes by
    offering quality products and innovative services at competitive
    prices.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
    concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive
    pressure on Key’s core banking products and services.
    Consolidation efforts continued during 2009 as the challenges of
    the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to redistribution
    of deposits and certain banking assets to stronger and larger
    financial institutions. Financial institutions with liquidity
    challenges sought mergers and the deposits and certain banking
    assets of the 140 banks that failed during 2009, representing
    $170.9 billion in total assets, were redistributed through
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s
    (“FDIC”) least-cost resolution process. While the
    number of bank failures increased dramatically in 2009, from 26
    in 2008, the total asset value of the 2008 bank failures
    represented $373.6 billion, in large part due to the
    failure of Washington Mutual. These factors intensified the
    concentration of the industry and placed increased competitive
    pressure on Key’s core banking products and services.

The competitive landscape continued to be affected by the
    conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding
    companies. The challenges of the liquidity crisis increased the
    desirability of the bank holding company structure due to the
    access it provides to government-sponsored sources of liquidity,
    such as the discount window and other programs designed
    specifically for bank holding companies and certain of their
    affiliates. The financial modernization legislation enacted in
    November 1999, which permits commercial bank affiliates to have
    affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities, underwrite
    insurance and make merchant banking investments under certain
    conditions, has enabled many of the more recent structural and
    regulatory changes. These structural and regulatory changes
    intensified the competitive landscape within which we compete,
    as these additional institutions now have access to low cost
    funding. For additional information on the financial
    modernization legislation, see the “Financial Modernization
    Legislation” section of this report.

Supervision
    and Regulation

The following discussion addresses certain material elements of
    the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies
    and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information
    regarding Key. This regulatory framework is intended primarily
    to protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund
    (the “DIF”) of the FDIC and the banking system as a
    whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of
    security holders.

Below is a brief discussion of selected laws, regulations and
    regulatory agency policies applicable to Key. This discussion is
    not intended to be comprehensive and is qualified in its
    entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes,
    regulations and regulatory agency policies to which this
    discussion refers. We cannot necessarily predict changes in the
    applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet
    such changes may have a material effect on our business,
    financial condition or results of operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”)
    under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
    in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
    all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies
    are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or
    industrial activities.

KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive
    regulation, supervision and examination by applicable federal
    banking agencies. KeyCorp operates one full-service,
    FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national
    bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a
    fiduciary. Both of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries and
    their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and
    examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
    (the “OCC”). Because domestic deposits in KeyBank are
    insured (up to applicable limits) and certain deposits of
    KeyBank and debt obligations of KeyBank and KeyCorp are
    temporarily guaranteed (up to applicable limits) by the FDIC,
    the FDIC also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority
    over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
    (the “FDIA”).



KeyCorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are
    subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve Board, as well as other applicable state and
    federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
    For example, KeyCorp’s brokerage and asset management
    subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the
    SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and state
    securities regulators, and KeyCorp’s insurance subsidiaries
    are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
    authorities of the various states. Other nonbank subsidiaries of
    KeyCorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they are authorized
    to do business.

Dividend
    Restrictions

On November 14, 2008, KeyCorp sold $2.5 billion of
    Fixed-Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B
    (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and a warrant to
    purchase 35,244,361 common shares, par value $1.00 (the
    “Warrant”), to the United States Department of the
    Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) in conjunction
    with its Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”). The
    terms of the transaction with the U.S. Treasury include
    limitations on KeyCorp’s ability to pay dividends and
    repurchase Common Shares. For three years after the issuance or
    until the U.S. Treasury no longer holds any Series B
    Preferred Stock, KeyCorp will not be able to increase its
    dividends above the level paid in the third quarter of 2008, nor
    will KeyCorp be permitted to repurchase any of its Common Shares
    or preferred stock without the approval of the
    U.S. Treasury, subject to the availability of certain
    limited exceptions (

e.g.,

for purchases in connection
    with benefit plans). The Federal Reserve Board also advised in
    its February 24, 2009 Supervisory Letter SR

09-04

that
    recipients of CPP funds should communicate reasonably in advance
    with Federal Reserve Board staff concerning how any proposed
    dividends, capital redemptions and capital repurchases are
    consistent with the requirements of CPP, and discouraged bank
    holding companies from using proceeds of the CPP to pay
    dividends on trust preferred securities or repay debt
    obligations.

In addition, federal banking law and regulations limit the
    amount of dividends that may be paid to KeyCorp by its bank
    subsidiaries without regulatory approval. Historically,
    dividends paid to KeyCorp by KeyBank have been an important
    source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity
    securities and interest on its debt. The approval of the OCC is
    required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if
    the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of
    such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of:
    (i) the bank’s net income for the current year plus
    (ii) the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by
    regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
    transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any
    preferred stock. In addition, a national bank can pay dividends
    only to the extent of its undivided profits. KeyCorp’s
    national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions.
    During 2009, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to KeyCorp;
    nonbank subsidiaries paid KeyCorp a total of $.8 million in
    dividends. As of the close of business on December 31,
    2009, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to
    KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a
    net loss of $1.151 billion for 2009 and a net loss of
    $1.161 billion for 2008. KeyCorp made capital infusions of
    $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, into KeyBank in the form of cash. At
    December 31, 2009, KeyCorp held $3.5 billion in
    short-term investments, the funds from which can be used to pay
    dividends, service debt, and finance corporate operations.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
    institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
    engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
    financial condition of the institution, could include the
    payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
    institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
    FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
    depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
    level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
    the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay any
    dividend (i) if payment would cause it to become less than
    “adequately capitalized” or (ii) while it is in
    default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. For
    additional information on capital guidelines see the
    “Federal Deposit Insurance Act — Prompt
    Corrective Action” section of this report. Also, the
    federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that
    provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their
    holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of
    their current operating earnings.

Holding
    Company Structure

Bank Transactions with Affiliates.

Federal
    banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose
    qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain
    transactions by a bank with its affiliates. Transactions



covered by these provisions, which include bank loans and other
    extensions of credit to affiliates, bank purchases of assets
    from affiliates, and bank sales of assets to affiliates, must be
    on arm’s length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts,
    determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital,
    and if a loan or other extension of credit, must be secured by
    collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by
    statute. For these purposes, a bank includes certain of its
    subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control, while
    an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding
    company, certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies
    it is deemed to control, and certain other companies. As a
    result, these provisions materially restrict the ability of
    KeyBank, as a bank, to fund its affiliates including KeyCorp,
    KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds,
    and KeyCorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making
    merchant banking investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under Federal
    Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to
    serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each
    of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to
    commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This
    support may be required at a time when KeyCorp may not have the
    resources to, or would choose not to, provide it. Certain loans
    by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate
    in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other
    indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law
    provides that in the event of its bankruptcy, any commitment by
    a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to
    maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
    bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Regulatory
    Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory
    Capital.

Federal law defines and prescribes
    minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies
    and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy of regulatory capital is
    assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the
    examination and supervision process, and in the evaluation of
    applications in connection with specific transactions and
    activities, including acquisitions, expansion of existing
    activities and commencement of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These
    guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to
    risk-weighted assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are
    calculated by assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories
    of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, based primarily on
    counterparty credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1
    capital by risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The
    required minimum total risk-based capital ratio is currently
    8.00%. It is calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount
    of Tier 1 capital), after certain deductions, by
    risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
    preferred equity (including the Series A Preferred Stock
    and the Series B Preferred Stock), and minority interests
    in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain
    intangible assets (including goodwill) and certain other assets.
    Tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital
    instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt
    securities, perpetual preferred equity not includable in
    Tier 1 capital, and limited amounts of term subordinated
    debt, medium-term preferred equity, certain unrealized holding
    gains on certain equity securities, and the allowance for loan
    and lease losses, limited as a percentage of net risk-weighted
    assets.

Bank holding companies, such as KeyCorp, whose securities and
    commodities trading activities exceed specified levels, also are
    required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk
    includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign
    exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad
    market movements (such as changes in the general level of
    interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or
    commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as
    idiosyncratic variation, event risk, and default risk). The
    federal banking agencies have developed and published for
    comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market
    risk capital requirements. The proposed rule would enhance
    modeling requirements consistent with advances in risk
    management, enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured
    in the current methodologies of the existing requirements, and
    modify the definition of covered position to better capture
    positions for which the market risk capital requirements are
    appropriate. It would also impose an explicit capital
    requirement for incremental default risk to capture default risk
    over a time horizon of one year taking into account the impact
    of liquidity,



concentrations, hedging, and optionality. The proposed rule has
    not yet been adopted as a final rule. At December 31, 2009,
    Key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based
    requirements, including all required adjustments for market risk.

In addition to the risk-based standard, bank holding companies
    are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s leverage ratio
    guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage ratio,
    calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average total
    consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding companies that
    either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented
    the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for
    market risk. All other bank holding companies must maintain a
    minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. At December 31,
    2009, Key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum
    leverage capital requirements.

KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC,
    which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal
    Reserve Board on bank holding companies. At December 31,
    2009, each of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries had
    regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based and
    leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
    to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
    that are not taken into account in the computation of the
    capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
    evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
    adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
    regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
    organization. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has
    advised KeyCorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any
    specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratios
    applicable to KeyCorp or such national bank subsidiary.

Basel Accords.

The current minimum risk-based
    capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking
    agencies are based on a 1988 international accord (“Basel
    I”) that was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking
    Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee published its new
    capital framework document (“Basel II”) governing the
    capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking
    organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
    management and measurement systems. Basel II is designed to
    create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk
    measurement and management processes and to better align minimum
    capital requirements with the risks underlying activities
    conducted by these organizations.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
    capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
    supervisory review, and market discipline. The minimum capital
    requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit,
    operational, and market risk exposures of a banking
    organization. The supervisory review pillar addresses the need
    for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy
    position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with
    respect to its minimum capital requirement, as well as the need
    for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and
    respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy
    assessment. The market discipline pillar imposes public
    disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are
    intended to allow market participants to assess key information
    about the organization’s risk profile and its associated
    level of capital.

In December 2007, the federal banking agencies issued a final
    rule to implement the advanced approaches framework of
    Basel II in the U.S. The rule was effective
    April 1, 2008, but implementation is subject to a
    multi-year transition period in which limits are imposed upon
    the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease. It
    does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective
    action and leverage capital requirements, and explicitly
    reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations
    to hold additional capital where appropriate. Application of the
    final rule to U.S. banking organizations is mandatory for
    some and optional for others. Currently, neither KeyCorp nor
    KeyBank is required to apply the final rule.

In July 2008, the agencies issued a proposed rule for
    implementing the standardized approach framework of Basel II.
    The proposal would provide an alternative approach to
    determining risk-based capital requirements for banking
    organizations that are not required to use the advanced
    approaches framework final rule published in December 2007.
    While the advanced approaches framework is mandatory for large,
    internationally active banking organizations, the standardized
    approach framework would be optional for others (including
    KeyCorp and KeyBank), which could also choose to remain under
    the Basel I framework.



In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
    published proposals to substantially revamp international
    capital and liquidity standards for banks. This proposal
    includes major changes to the regulatory and leverage capital
    ratio calculations, including a revised definition of capital, a
    revised capital structure, revised definitions of qualifying
    capital for Tier 1 purposes, revised Tier 1 and
    Tier 2 limits, a new common equity to risk-weighted assets
    measure, new minimum capital ratios and certain measures to
    address systemic risk. Banks have the opportunity to submit
    comments on the proposal by April 16, 2010. Specific
    requirements remain undefined and, therefore, KeyCorp cannot
    determine what impact such measures may ultimately have on the
    company.

Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Deposit Insurance Coverage Limits.

Prior to
    enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (“EESA”), the FDIC standard maximum depositor
    insurance coverage limit was $100,000, excluding certain
    retirement accounts qualifying for a maximum coverage limit of
    $250,000. Pursuant to the EESA, the FDIC standard maximum
    coverage limit had been temporarily increased to $250,000
    through December 31, 2009. This temporary increase has been
    further extended to December 31, 2013, by the Helping
    Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.

Deposit Insurance Assessments.

Substantially
    all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to
    applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, KeyBank is subject
    to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. Under
    current law, the FDIC is required to maintain the DIF reserve
    ratio within the range of 1.15% to 1.50% of estimated insured
    deposits. Because the DIF reserve ratio fell and was expected to
    remain below 1.15%, the FDIA required the FDIC to establish and
    implement a restoration plan to restore the DIF reserve ratio to
    at least 1.15% within eight years, absent extraordinary
    circumstances. Consequently, and depending upon an
    institution’s risk category, for the first quarter of 2009
    annualized deposit insurance assessments ranged from $.12 to
    $.50 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits, as compared
    with $.05 to $.43 throughout 2008. Moreover, under a new
    risk-based assessment system implemented in the second quarter
    of 2009, annualized deposit insurance assessments range from
    $.07 to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits
    based on the institution’s risk category. On May 22,
    2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis
    point special assessment on each insured depository
    institution’s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of
    June 30, 2009, not to exceed 10 basis points times the
    institution’s assessment base as of June 30, 2009.
    This special assessment was collected on September 30,
    2009. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC amended its assessment
    regulations to require insured depository institutions to
    prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly
    assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010,
    2011, and 2012. The amount of KeyBank’s FDIC assessment
    prepayment was $539 million, which we paid on
    December 30, 2009.

FICO Assessments.

Since 1997, all FDIC-insured
    depository institutions have been required through assessments
    collected by the FDIC to service the annual interest on

30-year

noncallable bonds issued by the Financing Corporation
    (“FICO”) in the late 1980s to fund losses incurred by
    the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO
    assessments are separate from and in addition to deposit
    insurance assessments, are adjusted quarterly and, unlike
    deposit insurance assessments, are assessed uniformly without
    regard to an institution’s risk category. Throughout 2009,
    the annualized FICO assessment rate ranged from $.0102 to $.0114
    for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits.

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.

In
    October 2008, the FDIC, with the written concurrence of the
    Federal Reserve Board, made a systemic risk recommendation to
    the Secretary of the Treasury, who in consultation with the
    President determined that the systemic risk exception to the
    least-cost resolution provision under the FDIA should be invoked
    to enable the FDIC to establish the Temporary Liquidity
    Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”).

The TLGP regulation permitted the FDIC to temporarily guarantee
    the unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of
    qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating
    eligible entities (the “Debt Guarantee”) as well as
    all depositor funds in qualifying noninterest-bearing
    transaction accounts maintained at participating FDIC-insured
    depository institutions (the “Transaction Account
    Guarantee”). For FDIC-guaranteed debt issued before
    April 1, 2009, the Debt Guarantee expires on the earlier of
    the maturity of the debt or June 30, 2012. For
    FDIC-guaranteed debt issued on or after April 1, 2009, the
    Debt Guarantee expires on the earlier of the maturity of the
    debt or December 31, 2012. Unless a participating
    institution elected to opt-out, the Transaction Account
    Guarantee expires on June 30, 2010.



Participants in the TLGP are subject to certain assessments by
    the FDIC. Assessments on participants under the Debt Guarantee
    part of the TLGP are computed by multiplying the amount of their
    FDIC-guaranteed debt by annualized rates that, depending on the
    type of issuer entity as well as the issuance and maturity dates
    of such debt, range from 50 to 110 basis points. Surcharges
    on these assessments ranging from 10 to 50 basis points
    depending on the issuance and maturity dates of the debt are
    also prescribed. In addition, participants under the Debt
    Guarantee part of the TLGP that have elected to have
    flexibility, before exceeding their FDIC-guaranteed debt limit,
    to issue certain senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the
    FDIC are assessed an additional one-time, nonrefundable fee of
    37.5 basis points. Assessments on participants under the
    Transaction Account Guarantee part of the TLGP are computed by
    multiplying qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction account
    balances in excess of $250,000 by an annualized ten basis point
    rate prior to January 1, 2010, and a 15, 20 or
    25 basis point rate, depending on the institution’s
    risk category, on and after January 1, 2010 until
    June 30, 2010. Moreover, to the extent that participant
    assessments are insufficient to cover the expenses or losses to
    the DIF arising from the TLGP, the FDIA requires the FDIC to
    impose one or more special assessments on FDIC-insured
    depository institutions and depository institution holding
    companies.

KeyCorp is a participant in the Debt Guarantee component of the
    TLGP. KeyBank is a participant in both the Transaction Account
    Guarantee and the Debt Guarantee components of the TLGP,
    including the special election to issue long-term, senior
    unsecured debt not guaranteed by the FDIC. As of
    December 31, 2009, KeyCorp had $937.5 million of
    guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP and KeyBank had
    $1.0 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP.

Liability of Commonly Controlled
    Institutions.

Under the FDIA, an insured
    depository institution which is under common control with
    another insured depository institution generally is liable to
    the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be
    incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any such
    commonly controlled institution, or any assistance provided by
    the FDIC to the commonly controlled institution which is in
    danger of default. The term “default” is defined
    generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver
    and the term “in danger of default” is defined
    generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that
    a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of
    regulatory assistance.

Conservatorship and Receivership of
    Institutions.

If any insured depository
    institution becomes insolvent and the FDIC is appointed its
    conservator or receiver, the FDIC may, under federal law,
    disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is
    a party, if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract
    would be burdensome, and that disaffirmance or repudiation of
    the contract would promote the orderly administration of the
    institution’s affairs. Such disaffirmance or repudiation
    would result in a claim by its holder against the receivership
    or conservatorship. The amount paid upon such claim would depend
    upon, among other factors, the amount of receivership assets
    available for the payment of such claim and its priority
    relative to the priority of others. In addition, the FDIC as
    conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into
    by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for
    termination, default, acceleration, or exercise of rights upon
    or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution,
    appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or
    exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for
    the institution. The FDIC as conservator or receiver also may
    transfer any asset or liability of the institution without
    obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s
    shareholders or creditors.

Depositor Preference.

The FDIA provides that,
    in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an
    insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors
    (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
    and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as
    receiver would be afforded a priority over other general
    unsecured claims against such an institution. If an insured
    depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors
    along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured,
    nondeposit creditors, including a parent holding company and
    subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The “prompt
    corrective action” provisions of the FDIA create a
    statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary
    and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level
    of FDIC-insured depository institutions. These provisions impose
    progressively more restrictive constraints on operations,
    management, and capital distributions of the institution as its
    regulatory capital decreases, or in some cases, based on
    supervisory information other than the institution’s
    capital level. This framework and the authority it confers on



the federal banking agencies supplements other existing
    authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory
    actions to address capital deficiencies. Moreover, other
    provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level
    designations the same as or similar to those established by the
    prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain
    restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic
    and other benefits upon institutions. These include restrictions
    on brokered deposits, limits on exposure to interbank
    liabilities, determination of risk-based FDIC deposit insurance
    premium assessments, and action upon regulatory applications.

FDIC-insured depository institutions are grouped into one of
    five prompt corrective action capital categories —
    well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
    significantly undercapitalized and critically
    undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based,
    total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the
    relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well
    capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
    least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
    6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
    and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
    directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution must have
    a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.00% and a
    Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.00% (3.00% if
    it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent
    examination and is not well capitalized). An institution’s
    prompt corrective action capital category, however, may not
    constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial
    condition or prospects of the institution or its parent bank
    holding company, and should be considered in conjunction with
    other available information regarding the financial condition
    and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank
    holding company. KeyBank is well-capitalized pursuant to the
    prompt corrective action guidelines.

Financial Modernization Legislation

The provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the
    “GLBA”) authorized new activities for qualifying
    financial institutions. The GLBA repealed significant provisions
    of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit commercial banks, among
    other things, to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in
    securities and make merchant banking investments. The GLBA
    modified the BHCA to permit bank holding companies that meet
    certain specified standards (known as “financial holding
    companies”) to engage in a broader range of financial
    activities than previously permitted under the BHCA, and allowed
    subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified
    standards (known as “financial subsidiaries”) to
    engage in a wide range of financial activities that are
    prohibited to such banks themselves. In 2000, KeyCorp elected to
    become a financial holding company. Under the authority
    conferred by the GLBA, KeyCorp has been able to expand the
    nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, acquire its Victory Capital Advisers Inc. subsidiary,
    operate its KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. subsidiary with fewer
    operating restrictions, and establish financial subsidiaries to
    engage more efficiently in certain activities.

In order for a company to maintain its status as a financial
    holding company under the GLBA, its depository institution
    subsidiaries must remain well capitalized (as defined under the
    prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA) and well
    managed (as determined by the depository institution’s
    primary regulator). If any of the depository institution
    subsidiaries of a financial holding company fail to satisfy
    these criteria, the holding company must enter into an agreement
    with the Federal Reserve Board setting forth a plan to correct
    the deficiencies. If these deficiencies are not corrected within
    a

180-day

period, the Federal Reserve Board may order the financial
    holding company to divest its depository institution
    subsidiaries. Alternatively, the holding company could retain
    its depository institution subsidiaries but would have to cease
    engaging in any activities that are permissible under the GLBA
    but were not permissible for a bank holding company prior to the
    enactment of that statute. In addition, if a depository
    institution subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a
    less than satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment
    Act (“CRA”), the holding company will not be permitted
    to commence new activities or make new acquisitions in reliance
    on the GLBA until the CRA rating of the subsidiary improves to
    being at least satisfactory.



Entry Into Certain Covenants

KeyCorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and one
    transaction (with an overallotment option) in 2008, each of
    which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities
    (“Trust Preferred Securities”) by Delaware
    statutory trusts formed by KeyCorp (the “Trusts”), as
    further described below. Simultaneously with the closing of each
    of those transactions, KeyCorp entered into a so-called
    replacement capital covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital
    Covenant” and collectively, the “Replacement Capital
    Covenants”) for the benefit of persons that buy or hold
    specified series of long-term indebtedness of KeyCorp or its
    then largest depository institution, KeyBank (the “Covered
    Debt”). Each of the Replacement Capital Covenants provide
    that neither KeyCorp nor any of its subsidiaries (including any
    of the Trusts) will redeem or purchase all or any part of the
    Trust Preferred Securities or certain junior subordinated
    debentures issued by KeyCorp and held by the Trust (the
    “Junior Subordinated Debentures”), as applicable, on
    or before the date specified in the applicable Replacement
    Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions, except to the
    extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date of that
    redemption or purchase, KeyCorp has received proceeds from the
    sale of qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the Trust Preferred
    Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, as applicable,
    at the time of redemption or purchase, and (ii) KeyCorp has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if
    such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.
    KeyCorp will provide a copy of the Replacement Capital Covenants
    to respective holders of Covered Debt upon request made in
    writing to KeyCorp, Investor Relations, 127 Public Square, Mail
    Code OH-01-27-1113, Cleveland, OH

44114-1306.

    each transaction, (ii) issuer, (iii) series of

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

An investment in our Common Shares is subject to risks inherent
    to our business, ownership of our equity securities and our
    industry. Described below are certain risks and uncertainties,
    the occurrence of which could have a material and adverse effect
    on KeyCorp. Before making an investment decision, you should
    carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below
    together with all of the other information included or
    incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and
    uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
    Although we have significant risk management policies,
    procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks,
    uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations.
    This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO
    LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
    AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS
    WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON
    SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B PREFERRED
    STOCK AND OUR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES — COULD
    DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR
    PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

Risks
    Related to our Business

Certain
    industries, including the financial services industry, are more
    significantly affected by certain economic factors such as
    unemployment and real estate asset values. Should the
    improvement of these economic factors lag the improvement of the
    overall economy, or not occur, we could be adversely
    affected.

Should the stabilization of the U.S. economy lead to a
    general economic recovery, the improvement of certain economic
    factors, such as unemployment and real estate asset values and
    rents, may nevertheless continue to lag behind the overall
    economy, or not occur at all. These economic factors typically
    affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial
    services, more significantly. For example, improvements in
    commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic
    recovery by twelve to eighteen months. Our clients include
    entities active in these industries. Furthermore, financial
    services companies, with a substantial lending business, like
    ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make
    debt service payments on loans. Should unemployment or real
    estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of
    time, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to market risks, including in the commercial real estate
    sector. Should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate
    market further deteriorate, our financial condition and results
    of operations could be adversely affected.

The fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector remain
    weak, under continuing pressure by reduced asset values, rising
    vacancies and reduced rents. Commercial real estate values
    peaked in the fall of 2007, after gaining approximately 30%
    since 2005 and 90% since 2001. According to Moody’s Real
    Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Index, at
    November 30, 2009, commercial real estate values were down
    43% from their peak. Many of our commercial real estate loans
    were originated between 2005 and 2007. A portion of our
    commercial real estate loans are construction loans. These
    properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of
    the loan, but the borrower may be reliant upon additional
    leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to
    support debt service payments. Weak economic conditions
    typically slow the execution of new leases; such conditions may
    also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these
    factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space
    are expected to continue to rise in 2010. Increased vacancies
    could result in rents falling further over the next several
    quarters. The combination of these factors could result in
    further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial
    real estate market. Should these fundamentals continue to
    deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and
    the instability of rental income, it could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Declining
    asset prices could adversely affect us.

Over the last six quarters, the volatility and disruption that
    the capital and credit markets have experienced reached extreme
    levels. The market dislocations led to the failure of several
    substantial financial institutions, causing widespread
    liquidation of assets and further constraining credit markets.
    These asset sales, along with asset sales by



other leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, rapidly
    drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded
    asset classes. Asset price deterioration has a negative effect
    on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on
    our balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at
    prices we deem acceptable. This could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to credit risk.

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
    activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
    of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
    conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
    interest rates

and/or

further weakening of economic conditions could adversely impact
    the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value
    of the collateral securing these loans.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately 71% of our loan
    portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
    loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
    mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
    types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate
    loans and consumer loans. We closely monitor and manage risk
    concentrations and utilize various portfolio management
    practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible
    to do so; however, our loan portfolio still contains a number of
    commercial loans with relatively large balances.

We also do business with environmentally sensitive industries
    and in connection with the development of Brownfield sites that
    provide appropriate business opportunities. We monitor and
    evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmental-related
    covenants, which include covenants requiring compliance with
    applicable law. We take steps to mitigate risks; however, should
    political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our
    customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants, our
    credit quality could be adversely affected.

The deterioration of one or  more of any of our loans could
    cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could
    result in net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in
    the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan
    charge-offs, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Us.

We also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect
    our lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws
    and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement
    action that could result in the assessment against us of civil
    money or other penalties, which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

The
    credit ratings of KeyCorp and KeyBank are important in order to
    maintain liquidity.

Although KeyCorp’s and KeyBank’s long-term debt is
    currently rated investment-grade by the major rating agencies,
    the ratings of Key’s long-term debt, Series A
    Preferred Stock and certain of its other securities have been
    downgraded

and/or

put
    on negative outlook by those major rating agencies. These rating
    agencies regularly evaluate the securities of KeyCorp and
    KeyBank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other
    securities are based on a number of factors, including
    Key’s financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and
    other factors, some of which are not entirely within Key’s
    control, such as conditions affecting the financial services
    industry and the economy. In light of the difficulties in the
    financial services industry, the financial markets and the
    economy, there can be no assurance that Key will maintain its
    current ratings.

If the securities of KeyCorp

and/or

KeyBank suffer additional ratings downgrades, such downgrades
    could adversely affect access to liquidity and could
    significantly increase Key’s cost of funds, trigger
    additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the
    number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to Key,
    thereby curtailing its business operations and reducing its
    ability to generate income. Further downgrades of the credit
    ratings of Key’s securities, particularly if they are below
    investment-grade, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

There
    can be no assurance that the EESA, the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other initiatives undertaken by
    the United States government to restore liquidity and stability
    to the U.S. financial system will help stabilize the U.S.
    financial system.

The EESA was enacted and signed into law by President Bush in
    October 2008 in response to the ongoing financial crisis
    affecting the banking system and financial markets and going
    concern threats to investment banks and other financial
    institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has
    authority to, among other things, purchase up to



$700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities,
    preferred equity and warrants, and certain other financial
    instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of
    stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial
    markets. Under its authority provided by EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury established the CPP, and the core provisions
    of the Financial Stability Plan. There can be no assurance
    regarding the actual impact that the EESA, the American Recovery
    and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“Recovery Bill”), or
    other programs and initiatives undertaken by the
    U.S. government will have on the financial markets. The
    extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability
    experienced in late 2008 and through the third quarter of
    2009 may return or persist. Regional financial institutions
    have faced difficulties issuing debt in the fixed-income debt
    markets; these conditions could return and pose continued
    difficulties for the issuance of both medium term note and
    long-term subordinated note issuances. The failure of the EESA
    or other government programs to sufficiently contribute to
    financial market stability and put the U.S. economy on a
    path for an economic recovery could result in a continuation or
    worsening of current financial market conditions, which could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. In the event that any of
    the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial
    markets continue, or, as the case may be, return or become
    exacerbated, there may be a Material Adverse Effect on Us from
    (1) continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in
    financial markets, (2) continued capital and liquidity
    concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our
    transaction counterparties specifically, (3) limitations
    resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or
    provide additional regulation of the financial system, or
    (4) recessionary conditions that return, are deeper, or
    last longer than currently anticipated.

The
    U.S. Treasury may require us to raise additional capital that
    would likely be dilutive to our Common Shares.

In our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, we reported
    that, under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Assessment
    Program (“CAP”), we were required to participate in
    the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (“SCAP”) to
    determine whether we would be required to raise additional
    capital. As announced on May 7, 2009, under the SCAP
    assessment, we were required to increase the amount of our
    Tier 1 common equity by $1.8 billion within six
    months. We generated in excess of the $1.8 billion of
    additional Tier 1 common equity required by the SCAP
    results. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our
    regulators, including the U.S. Treasury and the Federal
    Reserve Board, will not conduct additional “stress
    test” capital assessments outside of typical examination
    cycles, such as the SCAP,

and/or

require us to generate additional capital, including Tier 1
    common equity, in the future in the event of further negative
    economic circumstances, or in order for us to redeem our
    Series B Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury
    under the CPP. Any additional capital that KeyCorp generates in
    the future, whether through exchange offers, underwritten
    offerings of Common Shares, or other public or private
    transactions, would be dilutive to common shareholders and may
    reduce the market price of our Common Shares. These factors
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    potential issuance of a significant amount of Common Shares or
    equity convertible into our Common Shares to a private investor
    or group of private investors may be dilutive and cause the
    market price of our Common Shares to decline.

Having a significant shareholder may make some future
    transactions more difficult or perhaps impossible to complete
    without the support of such shareholder. The interests of the
    significant shareholder may not coincide with our interests or
    the interests of other shareholders. There can be no assurance
    that any significant shareholder will exercise its influence in
    our best interests as opposed to its best interests as a
    significant shareholder. A significant shareholder may make it
    difficult to approve certain transactions even if they are
    supported by the other shareholders, which may have an adverse
    effect on the market price of our Common Shares. These factors
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Issuing
    a significant amount of common equity to a private investor may
    result in a change in control of KeyCorp under regulatory
    standards and contractual terms.

Should KeyCorp obtain a significant amount of additional capital
    from any individual private investor, a change of control could
    occur under applicable regulatory standards and contractual
    terms. Such change of control may trigger notice, approval

and/or

other
    regulatory requirements in many states and jurisdictions in
    which we operate. We are a party to various contracts and other
    agreements that may require us to obtain consents from our
    respective contract counterparties in the event of a change in
    control. The failure to obtain any required regulatory consents
    or approvals or contractual consents due to a change in control
    may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.



Should
    we decide to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s Series B
    Preferred Stock, future issuance(s) of Common Shares may be
    necessary, which, if necessary, would likely result in
    significant dilution to holders of KeyCorp Common
    Shares.

In conjunction with any repurchase of the Series B
    Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, we may elect
    or be required by our regulators to increase the amount of our
    Tier 1 common equity through the sale of additional Common
    Shares. In addition, in connection with the
    U.S. Treasury’s purchase of the Series B
    Preferred Stock, pursuant to a Letter Agreement dated
    November 14, 2008, and the Securities Purchase
    Agreement — Standard Terms, the U.S. Treasury
    received a Warrant to purchase 35,244,361 of our Common Shares
    at an initial per share exercise price of $10.64, subject to
    adjustment, which expires ten years from the issuance date, and
    we have agreed to provide the U.S. Treasury with
    registration rights covering the Warrant and the underlying
    Common Shares. The terms of the Warrant provide for a procedure,
    upon repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock, to
    determine the value of the Warrant, and purchase the Warrant,
    within approximately 40 days of the repurchase of the
    Series B Preferred Stock. However, even if we were to
    redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, there is no assurance
    that this Warrant will be fully retired and, therefore, that it
    will not be exercised, prior to its expiration date. The
    issuance of additional Common Shares as a result of the exercise
    of the Warrant the U.S. Treasury holds would likely dilute
    the ownership interest of KeyCorp’s existing common
    shareholders.

The terms of the Warrant provide that, if we issue Common Shares
    or securities convertible or exercisable into or exchangeable
    for Common Shares at a price that is less than 90% of the market
    price of such shares on the last trading day preceding the date
    of the agreement to sell such shares, the number and the per
    share price of Common Shares to be purchased pursuant to the
    Warrant will be adjusted pursuant to its terms. We may also
    choose to issue securities convertible into or exercisable for
    our Common Shares and such securities may themselves contain
    anti-dilution provisions. Such anti-dilution adjustment
    provisions may have a further dilutive effect on other holders
    of our Common Shares.

There can be no assurance that we will not in the future
    determine that it is advisable, or that we will not encounter
    circumstances where we determine that it is necessary, to issue
    additional Common Shares, securities convertible into or
    exchangeable for Common Shares or common-equivalent securities
    to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to
    build additional capital. The market price of our Common Shares
    could decline as a result of such exchange offerings, as well as
    other sales of a large block of our Common Shares or similar
    securities in the market thereafter, or the perception that such
    sales could occur. These factors could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We may
    not be permitted to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP
    investment if and when we request approval to do
    so.

We have generated in excess of the $1.8 billion in
    additional Tier 1 common equity required by the SCAP. While
    it is our plan to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock
    as soon as practicable, in order to repurchase such securities,
    in whole or in part, we must establish to our regulators
    satisfaction that we have satisfied all of the conditions to
    repurchase and must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve
    and the U.S. Treasury. There can be no assurance that we
    will be able to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s TARP
    investment in our Series B Preferred Stock. In addition to
    limiting our ability to return capital to our shareholders, the
    U.S. Treasury’s investment could limit our ability to
    retain key executives and other key employees, and limit our
    ability to develop business opportunities. These factors could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

During
    2009, disruptions and volatility in financial markets adversely
    affected KeyCorp. These factors could continue to affect
    KeyCorp. Our actions in response to these financial market
    disruptions may not be sufficient to mitigate the effects of
    market uncertainties and other risks presented.

The capital and credit markets, including the fixed income
    markets, experienced extreme volatility and disruption between
    July 2007 and October 2009. The disruptions in the capital and
    credit markets reached unprecedented levels during the third and
    fourth quarters of 2008. As a result of the severe economic
    conditions, in 2009, we, and many financial institutions similar
    to us, generated and raised Tier 1 common equity through
    exchanges of existing trust preferred securities or preferred
    equity for common stock,

at-the-market

offerings of common stock or underwritten offerings of common
    stock, or a combination of the foregoing. Until the middle of
    the third quarter of 2009, regional financial institutions
    continued to encounter difficulties in the fixed income markets.



While most economists generally agree that the U.S. economy
    has stabilized, it remains unclear whether a sustainable
    recovery is underway. Uncertainties in the financial markets
    continue to present significant challenges, particularly for the
    financial services industry. As a financial services company,
    our operations and financial condition are significantly
    affected by general economic and market conditions. During 2009,
    the continued disruptions in the financial markets caused
    markdowns

and/or

losses by financial institutions from trading, hedging and other
    market activities, resulting in reduced earnings for many
    financial institutions. Additionally, financial institutions
    with lending operations faced substantial loan losses due to
    high unemployment, reduced real estate asset values and
    1.43 million bankruptcy filings in 2009, representing an
    increase of 32% from 2008. Unemployment at December 31,
    2009 was above 10%, up from 7.4% at December 31, 2008. We
    were similarly affected by these factors. During 2009, we
    increased our provision for loan losses by $1.622 billion
    or 106% in response to the continued deterioration in our loan
    portfolios resulting from the economic decline. During 2009, we
    also recorded noncash accounting charges of $268 million
    due to intangible assets impairment resulting from a decline in
    the fair value of our National Banking unit, reflecting the
    extreme weakness in financial markets, and our decisions to wind
    down the operations of Austin Capital Management Ltd.
    (“Austin”) and cease conducting our business in the
    commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets. It is
    difficult to predict how long these challenging economic
    conditions will exist, which of our markets, products or other
    businesses will ultimately be affected, and whether our actions
    will effectively mitigate these extreme external factors.
    Furthermore, the models that we use to assess the
    creditworthiness of customers and to estimate losses inherent in
    our credit exposure may become less predictive due to
    fundamental changes in the U.S. economy. Accordingly, these
    factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to interest rate risk.

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
    interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
    interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
    and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
    are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
    control, including general economic conditions, the competitive
    environment within our markets, consumer preferences for
    specific loan and deposit products and policies of various
    governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the
    Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including
    changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount
    of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
    interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
    could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
    deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
    liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
    borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
    receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
    and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
    could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
    loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest
    we pay on deposits and other borrowings. We use simulation
    analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate exposure based
    on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet changes,
    customer behavior, new products, new business volume, product
    pricing, competitor behavior, the behavior of market interest
    rates and anticipated hedging activities. Simulation analysis
    involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of
    future risks and trends. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
    that actual results will not differ from those derived in
    simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency
    of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed,
    changes in balance sheet composition, and the possible effects
    of unanticipated or unknown events.

Although we believe we have implemented effective asset and
    liability management strategies, including simulation analysis
    and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments,
    to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on
    our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in market interest rates could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to other market risk.

Traditionally, market factors such as changes in foreign
    exchange rates, changes in the equity markets and changes in the
    financial soundness of bond insurers, sureties and other
    unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect
    current market values of financial instruments. During 2008,
    market events demonstrated this to an extreme. Between July 2007
    and October 2009, conditions in the fixed income markets,
    specifically the wider credit spreads



over benchmark U.S. Treasury securities for many fixed
    income securities, caused significant volatility in the market
    values of loans, securities, and certain other financial
    instruments that are held in our trading or

held-for-sale

portfolios. Opportunities to minimize the adverse affects of
    market changes are not always available. It is possible that
    such volatility and adverse effects will continue over a
    prolonged period of time

and/or

worsen over time. It is not possible for us to predict whether
    there will be further substantial changes in the financial
    markets that could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

The
    soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect
    us.

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be
    adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of
    other financial institutions. Financial services to institutions
    are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty
    or other relationships. We have exposure to many different
    industries and counterparties, and routinely execute
    transactions with counterparties in the financial industry,
    including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment
    banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients.
    During 2008, Key incurred $54 million of derivative-related
    charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure
    of Lehman Brothers. Another example of losses related to this
    type of risk is the losses associated with the Bernie Madoff
    ponzi scheme (“Madoff ponzi scheme”). As a result of
    the Madoff ponzi scheme, our investment subsidiary, Austin,
    determined that its funds had suffered investment losses up to
    $186 million. Following Lehman Brothers failure, we took
    several steps to better measure, monitor, and mitigate our
    counterparty risks and to reduce these exposures. This includes
    daily position measurement and reporting, the use of scenario
    analysis and stress testing, replacement cost estimation, risk
    mitigation strategies, and market feedback validation.

Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more
    financial services institutions, or the financial services
    industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems
    and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other
    institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit
    risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In
    addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral
    held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices
    insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
    derivative exposure due us. It is not possible to anticipate all
    of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks
    completely. Accordingly, there is no assurance that losses from
    such risks would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to liquidity risk.

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
    level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences. Although we have implemented
    strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding
    to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in
    assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions,
    any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us. Certain credit markets that we
    participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were
    significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of
    2007 through the third quarter of 2009. These conditions in the
    recent past increase our liquidity risk exposure, and could
    return. While the credit markets have improved, the availability
    of credit and the cost of funds remain tight and more expensive
    than typical for an economy with a growing gross domestic
    product. Part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves
    promoting customer deposit growth, exiting certain noncore
    lending businesses, diversifying our funding base, maintaining a
    liquid asset portfolio, and strengthening our capital base to
    reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity. Many of these
    disrupted markets are showing signs of recovery. Nonetheless, if
    further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost
    effectiveness

and/or

the
    availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged
    period of time, we may need to expand the utilization of
    unsecured wholesale funding instruments, or use other potential
    means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as
    generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans,
    extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, purchasing
    deposits from other banks, borrowing under certain secured
    wholesale facilities, and utilizing relationships developed with
    fixed income investors in a variety of markets —
    domestic, European and Canadian — as well as increased
    management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other
    management tools. There can



be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be
    available; under certain stressed conditions experienced during
    the liquidity crisis, some of these alternative means of funding
    were not available. Should these forms of funding become
    unavailable, it is unclear what impact, given current economic
    conditions, unavailability of such funding would have on us. A
    deep and prolonged disruption in the markets could have the
    effect of significantly restricting the accessibility of cost
    effective capital and funding, which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Various
    factors may cause our allowance for loan losses to
    increase.

We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve
    established through a provision for loan losses charged to
    expense, that represents our estimate of losses within the
    existing portfolio of loans. The allowance is necessary to
    reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan
    portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects our ongoing
    evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks,
    loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present
    economic, political and regulatory conditions, and unexpected
    losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination
    of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses
    inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that
    we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future
    trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in
    economic conditions affecting borrowers, the stagnation of
    certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to,
    such as unemployment and real estate values, new information
    regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem
    loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control,
    may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In
    addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our
    allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the
    provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan
    charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ somewhat from
    those of our own management. In addition, if charge-offs in
    future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses
    (

i.e.

, if the loan allowance is inadequate), we will need
    additional loan loss provisions to increase the allowance for
    loan losses. Additional provisions to increase the allowance for
    loan losses, should they become necessary, would result in a
    decrease in net income and capital and may have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to operational risk.

Like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which
    represents the risk of loss resulting from human error,
    inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
    external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
    (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or
    noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices or ethical standards. We are also exposed to
    operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the
    affect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our
    outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to
    perform operational functions necessary to our business, such as
    certain loan processing functions. Additionally, some of our
    outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are
    subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they
    operate. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a
    system of internal controls, resulting losses from operational
    risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased
    operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone
    opportunities, any and all of which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Our
    profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in
    the geographic regions in which we operate.

Our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the
    markets in which we operate. We have concentrations of loans and
    other business activities in geographic areas where our branches
    are located — the Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the
    Great Lakes and the Northeast — as well as potential
    exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint.
    For example, the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our
    commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in several
    markets outside of our footprint. Real estate values and cash
    flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to
    weak economic conditions. Certain markets, such as Florida,
    southern California, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada,
    have experienced more significant deterioration. The
    delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs that we have
    experienced have been more heavily weighted to these specific
    markets. As a result of these and other economic factors, we
    recently increased the provision for loan losses. The regional
    economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business
    have an impact on the demand



for our products and services as well as the ability of our
    customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing
    loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A
    significant decline in general economic conditions caused by
    inflation, recession, an act of terrorism, outbreak of
    hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences,
    unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors,
    such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real
    estate, could also impact these regional economies and, in turn,
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry and market
    areas.

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
    from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
    larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
    primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
    smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
    operate. We also face competition from many other types of
    financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings
    associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance
    companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
    management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
    other local, regional and national financial services firms. In
    recent years, while the breadth of the institutions that we
    compete with has increased, competition has intensified as a
    result of consolidation efforts. During 2009, competition
    continued to intensify as the challenges of the liquidity crisis
    and market disruption led to further redistribution of deposits
    and certain banking assets to stronger and larger financial
    institutions. We expect this trend to continue. The competitive
    landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional
    investment banks to bank holding companies during the liquidity
    crisis due to the access it provides to government-sponsored
    sources of liquidity. The financial services industry’s
    competitive landscape could become even more intensified as a
    result of legislative, regulatory, structural and technological
    changes and continued consolidation. Also, technology has
    lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to
    offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
    factors, including, among other things:

•

our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and
    initiatives;

•

our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term
    customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical
    standards and safe, sound assets;

•

our ability to expand our market position;

•

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services
    offered to meet customer needs and demands;

•

the rate at which we introduce new products and services
    relative to our competitors;

•

our ability to attract and retain talented executives and
    relationship managers; and

•

industry and general economic trends.

Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
    weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
    our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to extensive government regulation and
    supervision.

We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and
    supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to
    protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds
    and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These
    regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure,
    investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other
    things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually
    review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible
    changes. It is likely that there will be significant changes to
    the banking and financial institutions’ regulatory regime
    in light of recent events affecting the financial services
    industry. It is not possible to predict the scope of such
    changes or their potential impact on our results of operations.

For example, President Obama announced in January 2010 a reform
    proposal to: (1) limit the scope of financial institutions
    and ensure that a bank will not own, invest in or sponsor a
    hedge fund or a private equity fund, or have proprietary trading
    operations unrelated to its service of its customers for its own
    profit; and (2) limit further consolidation of the
    financial sector. This proposal — sometimes referred
    to by the media as the Volcker Rule —



aims to place limits on the growth of market share at the
    largest financial firms, supplementing the existing caps on
    market share of deposits. It is impossible to predict whether
    President Obama’s proposal for financial regulatory reform
    will succeed or what the impact of any financial reform proposal
    would be on us or the banking industry generally. If this
    financial reform proposal is adopted in some form, it may, for
    example, limit the scope of financial services and investments
    that financial institutions with commercial banks may invest in,
    impose additional capital and liquidity standards,

and/or

limit
    the size of financial institutions in order to avoid any moral
    hazard associated with financial institutions deemed to big to
    fail. These types of reform could limit our ability to conduct
    certain of our businesses, such as funds that are part of our
    investment adviser subsidiary, Victory Capital Management Inc.,
    or funds sponsored and advised by, and investments in private
    equity funds made by, our principal investing line of business,
    which could require us to divest or spin-off certain of our
    business units and private equity investments. Furthermore, as
    part of the SCAP, Key was identified as a financial institution
    that was one of nineteen firms that collectively hold two-thirds
    of the banking assets and more than one-half of the loans in the
    U.S. banking system. While it is difficult to predict if
    regulatory reform will occur and the extent or nature of
    regulatory reform, should regulatory reform limit the size of
    the SCAP banks, our ability to pursue opportunities to achieve
    growth through the acquisition of other banks or deposits could
    be affected, which, in turn could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Us.

Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies; changes
    in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations
    or policies;

and/or

continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
    requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways, and could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the
    types of financial services and products that we may offer

and/or

increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial
    services and products, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with laws, regulations or policies
    (including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent
    such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
    agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us.

Our
    controls and procedures may fail or be
    circumvented.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure
    controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and
    procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and
    operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can
    provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the
    objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention
    of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with
    regulations related to controls and procedures could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We
    rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our
    funds.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    subsidiaries. With the exception of cash raised from debt and
    equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our cash flow
    from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the
    principal source of funds to pay dividends on our Common Shares
    and interest and principal on our debt. Federal banking law and
    regulations limit the amount of dividends that KeyBank
    (KeyCorp’s largest subsidiary) and certain nonbank
    subsidiaries may pay to KeyCorp. During 2008 and 2009, KeyBank
    did not pay any dividends to KeyCorp; nonbank subsidiaries paid
    KeyCorp $.8 million in dividends during 2009. As of the
    close of business on December 31, 2009, KeyBank would not
    have been permitted to pay dividends to KeyCorp without prior
    regulatory approval since the bank had a net loss of
    $1.151 billion for 2009 and a net loss of
    $1.161 billion for 2008. For further information on the
    regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by KeyBank
    see “Supervision and Regulation — Dividend
    Restrictions” of this report.

Also, KeyCorp’s right to participate in a distribution of
    assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is
    subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.
    In the event KeyBank is unable to pay dividends to KeyCorp, we
    may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay
    dividends on our Common Shares. The inability to receive
    dividends from KeyBank could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us.



Our
    earnings and/or financial condition may be affected by changes
    in accounting principles and in tax laws, or the interpretation
    of them.

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. Although these
    changes may not have an economic impact on our business, they
    could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain
    performance measures.

Like all businesses, we are subject to tax laws, rules and
    regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
    including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
    laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or
    other governmental bodies, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
    costs, among other things. Failure to appropriately comply with
    tax laws, rules and regulations could result in sanctions by
    regulatory agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Us.

Additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments of our deferred
    tax assets. The carrying value of these assets is dependent upon
    earnings forecasts and prior period earnings, among other
    things. A significant change in our assumptions could affect the
    carrying value of our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet,
    which, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Potential
    acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder
    value.

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
    risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
    other things:

•

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the
    target company;

•

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;

•

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and
    personnel of the target company;

•

potential disruption to our business;

•

potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;

•

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target
    company;

•

difficulty in estimating the value (including goodwill) of the
    target company;

•

difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets,
    liabilities and derivatives of the target company; and

•

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may
    affect the target company.

We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
    conduct due diligence activities related to possible
    transactions with other financial institutions and financial
    services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
    discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
    future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
    securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve
    the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,
    therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
    income per common share may occur in connection with any future
    transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected
    revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or
    product presence,

and/or

other
    projected benefits from an acquisition could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

We may
    not be able to attract and retain skilled people.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
    and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
    activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may
    not be able to retain or hire the people we want

and/or

need.
    In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must
    compensate such employees at market levels. Typically, those
    levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest
    expense. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain
    qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our
    competitive position, our performance, including our competitive
    position, could suffer, and, in turn, have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us. Although we maintain employment agreements with
    certain key employees, and have incentive compensation



plans aimed, in part, at long-term employee retention, the
    unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel
    could still occur, and such events may have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us because of the loss of the employee’s skills,
    knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the
    difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel
    for our talented executives

and/or

relationship managers.

Pursuant to the standardized terms of the CPP, among other
    things, we agreed to institute certain restrictions on the
    compensation of certain senior executive management positions
    that could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or
    retain the most qualified senior executives. Other restrictions
    may also be imposed under the Recovery Bill or other legislation
    or regulations. Our ability to attract

and/or

retain talented executives

and/or

relationship managers may be affected by these developments or
    any new executive compensation limits, and such restrictions
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Our
    information systems may experience an interruption or breach in
    security.

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
    conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in
    security of these systems could result in failures or
    disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
    ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies
    and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
    possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
    information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
    failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if
    any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed. The
    occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of
    our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a
    loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory
    scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible
    financial liability, any of which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

We
    continually encounter technological change.

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
    technological change with frequent introductions of new
    technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
    technology increases efficiency and enables financial
    institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our
    future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
    needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
    and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
    create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
    competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
    technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
    implement new technology-driven products and services or be
    successful in marketing these products and services to our
    customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological
    change affecting the financial services industry could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

We are
    subject to claims and litigation.

From time to time, customers

and/or

vendors may make claims and take legal action against us. We
    maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate
    based upon our assessment of the claims. Whether any particular
    claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such
    claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may
    result in significant financial liability

and/or

adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products
    and services as well as impact customer demand for those
    products and services. We are also involved, from time to time,
    in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal
    and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies
    regarding our business, including, among other things,
    accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result
    in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions
    or other relief. The number of these investigations and
    proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many
    firms in the financial services industry. There have also been a
    number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct
    by employees in the financial services industry in recent years,
    and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is
    not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and
    the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may
    not be effective in all cases. Any financial liability for which
    we have not adequately maintained reserves,

and/or

any
    reputation damage from such claims and legal actions, could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on Us.



Severe
    weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other
    external events could significantly impact our
    business.

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
    other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
    our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
    stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
    to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
    securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
    loss of revenue

and/or

cause
    us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established
    disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitor for
    significant environmental effects on our properties or our
    investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Risks
    Associated With Our Common Shares

Our
    issuance of securities to the U.S. Treasury may limit our
    ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to
    our Common Shares. If we are unable to redeem such preferred
    shares, the dividend rate increases substantially after five
    years.

In connection with our sale of $2.5 billion of the
    Series B Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury in
    conjunction with its CPP, we also issued a Warrant to purchase
    35,244,361 of our Common Shares at an exercise price of $10.64.
    The number of shares was determined based upon the requirements
    of the CPP, and was calculated based on the average market price
    of our Common Shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval
    of our issuance (which was also the basis for the exercise price
    of $10.64). The terms of the transaction with the
    U.S. Treasury include limitations on our ability to pay
    dividends and repurchase our Common Shares. For three years
    after the issuance or until the U.S. Treasury no longer
    holds any Series B Preferred Stock, we will not be able to
    increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend
    declared during the third quarter of 2008 ($0.1875 per common
    share on a quarterly basis) nor repurchase any of our Common
    Shares or preferred stock without, among other things,
    U.S. Treasury approval or the availability of certain
    limited exceptions

, e.g

., purchases in connection with
    our benefit plans. Furthermore, as long as the Series B
    Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is outstanding,
    dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to
    certain equity securities, including our Common Shares, are
    prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on
    such preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions.
    These restrictions, combined with the dilutive impact of the
    Warrant, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our
    Common Shares, and, as a result, they could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Us.

Unless we are able to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock
    during the first five years, the dividend payments on this
    capital will increase substantially at that point, from 5%
    ($125 million annually) to 9% ($225 million annually).
    Depending on market conditions at the time, this increase in
    dividends could significantly impact our liquidity and, as a
    result, have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

You
    may not receive dividends on the Common Shares.

Holders of our Common Shares are only entitled to receive such
    dividends as the Board of Directors may declare out of funds
    legally available for such payments. Furthermore, our common
    shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any
    holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing
    such preferred stock then outstanding. As of February 24,
    2010, there were 2,904,839 shares of KeyCorp’s
    Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of
    $100 per share issued and outstanding and 25,000 shares of
    the Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference
    of $100,000 per share issued and outstanding.

In July 2009, we reduced the quarterly dividend on our Common
    Shares to $0.01 per share. We do not expect to increase the
    quarterly dividend above $0.01 for the foreseeable future. We
    could decide to eliminate our Common Shares dividend altogether.
    Furthermore, as long as our Series A Preferred Stock and
    the Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, dividend
    payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain
    equity securities, including our Common Shares, are prohibited
    until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such
    preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. In
    addition, prior to November 14, 2011, unless we have
    redeemed all of the Series B Preferred Stock or the
    U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the Series B
    Preferred Stock to third parties, the consent of the
    U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other
    things, increase our Common Shares dividend above $.1875 except
    in limited circumstances. This could adversely affect the market
    price of our Common Shares. Also, KeyCorp is a bank holding
    company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is
    dependent on certain federal



regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the
    Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends.

In addition, terms of KeyBank’s outstanding junior
    subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or
    paying any dividends or distributions on KeyCorp’s capital
    stock, including its Common Shares, or purchasing, acquiring, or
    making a liquidation payment on such stock, if an event of
    default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable
    indenture, if we are in default with respect to a guarantee
    payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or
    if we have given notice of our election to defer interest
    payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced
    or a deferral period is continuing. These factors could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Us.

KeyCorp
    was required to conduct stress tests pursuant to the U.S.
    Treasury’s CAP and could be required to conduct additional
    stress tests and raise additional capital that would be dilutive
    to our Common Shares and may limit our ability to return capital
    to our shareholders.

On February 25, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced
    preliminary details of the CAP component of its Financial
    Stability Plan. The CAP was implemented to ensure the continued
    ability of U.S. financial institutions to lend to
    creditworthy borrowers in the event of a weaker than expected
    economic environment and larger than expected potential losses.
    Following the conduct of such stress tests, our regulators
    determined that we needed to generate an additional
    $1.8 billion of Tier 1 common equity.

We completed various capital transactions, generating in excess
    of $1.8 billion of additional Tier 1 common equity.
    Should the U.S. Treasury and our banking regulators
    determine that additional stress testing is necessary, or in
    order to receive approval to redeem our Series B Preferred,
    we may need to raise additional capital. Should this happen, we
    may only have a limited window to raise that capital. Should we
    need to issue additional equity capital, it would be dilutive to
    our Common Shares and may limit our ability to return capital to
    our shareholders. These factors may have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Us.

Our
    share price can be volatile.

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
    resell your Common Shares when you want and at prices you find
    attractive. Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
    response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

•

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
    operations;

•

recommendations by securities analysts;

•

operating and stock price performance of other companies that
    investors deem comparable to our business;

•

changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets,
    including the market for mortgage-related securities;

•

news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
    the financial services industry;

•

perceptions of us

and/or

our
    competitors in the marketplace;

•

new technology used, or products or services offered, by
    competitors;

•

significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic
    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments entered into
    by us or our competitors;

•

failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated
    benefits from acquisitions;

•

future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;

•

our past and future dividend practices;

•

changes in governmental regulations affecting our industry
    generally or our business and operations;

•

changes in global financial markets, economies and market
    conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock,
    commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility;



•

geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or
    military conflicts; and

•

the occurrence or nonoccurrence, as appropriate, of any
    circumstance described in these Risk Factors.

General market fluctuations, market disruption, industry factors
    and general economic and political conditions and events, such
    as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or
    credit loss trends, could also cause our share price to decrease
    regardless of operating results. Any of these factors could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

An
    investment in our Common Shares is not an insured
    deposit.

Our Common Shares are not a bank deposit and, therefore, are not
    insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
    fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our
    Common Shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in
    this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
    report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
    price of common shares in any company. As a result, if you
    acquire our Common Shares, you may lose some or all of your
    investment.

Our
    articles of incorporation and regulations, as well as certain
    banking laws, may have an anti-takeover effect.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and
    federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
    requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial
    to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may
    inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination,
    which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our
    Common Shares.

Risks
    Associated With Our Industry

Difficult
    market conditions have adversely affected the financial services
    industry, business and results of operations.

The dramatic deterioration experienced in the housing market led
    to weakness across geographies, industries, and ultimately the
    broad economy. Over the last 30 months, the housing market
    experienced falling home prices, increasing foreclosures;
    unemployment and under-employment rose significantly; and
    weakened commercial real estate fundamentals negatively impacted
    the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in
    significant write-downs of asset values by financial
    institutions, including government-sponsored entities, and
    commercial and investment banks. The resulting write-downs to
    assets of financial institutions have caused many financial
    institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger
    and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to seek government
    assistance or bankruptcy protection. It is not possible to
    predict how long these economic conditions will exist, which of
    our markets, products or other businesses will ultimately be
    affected, and whether our actions and government remediation
    efforts will effectively mitigate these factors. Accordingly,
    the resulting lack of available credit, lack of confidence in
    the financial sector, decreased consumer confidence, increased
    volatility in the financial markets and reduced business
    activity could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.
    Furthermore, continued deterioration in economic conditions
    could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and
    nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a
    decrease in demand for our products and services, among other
    things, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

As a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions,
    we may face the following risks, including, but not limited to:

•

Increased regulation of our industry, including heightened legal
    standards and regulatory requirements or expectations imposed in
    connection with the EESA, the Recovery Bill or other government
    initiatives. Compliance with such regulation will likely
    increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business
    opportunities.

•

Impairment of our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our
    customers if the models and approaches we use to select, manage,
    and underwrite customers become less predictive of future
    behaviors due to fundamental changes in economic conditions.



•

The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit
    exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments,
    including forecasts of economic conditions and how these
    economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers
    to repay their loans. In a highly uncertain economic
    environment, these processes may no longer be capable of
    accurate estimation and, in turn, may impact the reliability of
    our evaluation of our credit risk and exposure.

•

Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to
    engage in securitization funding transactions on favorable terms
    or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in
    the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating
    agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.

•

Increased intensity of competition in the financial services
    industry due to: (i) the continued trend of mergers of
    financial institutions with stronger and larger financial
    institutions and the redistribution of FDIC-insured deposits and
    certain banking assets through the FDIC least-cost resolution
    process, and (ii) the conversion of certain investment
    banks to bank holding companies. We expect competition to
    intensify as a result of these changes to the competitive
    landscape. Should competition in the financial services industry
    continue to intensify, our ability to market products and
    services may be adversely affected.

•

We will be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in
    the future because market developments have significantly
    depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of
    reserves to insured deposits. We are also likely to be required
    to pay other fees necessary to support the EESA, the Recovery
    Bill and other government efforts.

•

Financial institutions may be required, regardless of risk, to
    pay taxes or other fees to the U.S. Treasury. Such taxes or
    other fees could be designed to reimburse the U.S. Treasury
    for the many government programs and initiatives it has
    undertaken as part of its economic stimulus efforts.

•

Our ability to attract key executives

and/or

other
    key employees may be hindered as a result of executive
    compensation limits as a result of our participation in the CPP

and/or

regulations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury or
    other regulators pursuant to its authority under the EESA or the
    Recovery Bill. Furthermore, we may lose key executives

and/or

other
    key employees as a result of such limitations.

Financial
    services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of
    information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
    transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
    behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
    statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
    may also rely on representations of those customers,
    counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
    auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
    information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
    statements, credit reports or other financial information could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

Consumers
    may decide not to use banks to complete their financial
    transactions.

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
    through alternative methods financial transactions that
    historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
    maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would
    have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also
    complete transactions such as paying bills

and/or

transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The
    process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
    “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
    income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
    income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
    streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act), to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to
    KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that
    evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of
    these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all
    material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this

    over financial reporting (as defined in
