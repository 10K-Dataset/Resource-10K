ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It has elected to be a bank
holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”). At
December 31, 2005, KeyCorp was one of the nation’s
largest bank-based financial services companies with
consolidated total assets of $93.1 billion. Its
subsidiaries provide a wide range of retail and commercial
banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer
finance and investment banking products and services to
individual, corporate and institutional clients through two
major business groups: Consumer Banking, and Corporate and
Investment Banking. As of December 31, 2005, these services
were provided across much of the country through subsidiaries
operating 947 full-service retail banking branches
(“KeyCenters”), a telephone banking call center
services group and 2,180 ATMs, in sixteen states.
Additional information pertaining to the two business groups is
included in the “Line of Business Results” section
beginning on page 18 and in Note 4 (“Line of
Business Results”) beginning on page 64 of the Financial
Review section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to
Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto) and is incorporated herein
by reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries had an average of
19,485 full-time equivalent employees during 2005.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
deposits and making loans, KeyCorp’s bank and trust company
subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
management services, investment banking and capital markets
products, and international banking services. Through its
subsidiary bank, trust company and registered investment adviser
subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides investment management services to
clients that include large corporate and public retirement
plans, foundations and endowments, high net worth individuals
and Taft-Hartley plans (i.e., multiemployer trust funds
established for providing pension, vacation or other benefits to
employees).

KeyCorp provides other financial services both inside and
outside of its primary banking markets through its nonbank
subsidiaries. These services include accident, health, and
credit-life insurance on loans made by its subsidiary bank,
principal investing, community development financing, securities
underwriting and brokerage, merchant services, and other
financial services. KeyCorp is an equity participant in a joint
venture by Key Merchant Services, LLC, which provides merchant
services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank
and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
security holders and its creditors to participate in any
distribution of the assets or earnings of KeyCorp’s bank
and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the
respective creditors of such bank and other subsidiaries, except
to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as
creditor of such bank and other subsidiaries may be recognized.

The following financial data is included in the Financial Review
section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto) and is incorporated herein by reference

Acquisitions and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 3
(“Acquisitions”) on page 64 of the Financial Review
section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto) is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms,
investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local,
regional and national institutions which offer financial
services. Key competes by offering quality products and
innovative services at competitive prices.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
concentration in the banking industry and placed added
competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and
services. In addition, competition has intensified as a
consequence of the financial modernization laws that were
enacted in November 1999 to permit qualifying financial
institutions to expand into other activities. For example,
commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that
underwrite and deal in securities, underwrite insurance and make
merchant banking investments under certain conditions. See
“Financial Modernization Legislation” on page 7
of this report.

Supervision and Regulation

The following discussion addresses certain material elements of
the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies
and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information
regarding Key. The regulatory framework is intended primarily to
protect customers and depositors, the deposit insurance funds of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and
the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended to
protect security holders.

Set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws,
regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to Key.
This discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
statutes, regulations and regulatory agency policies to which
the discussion refers. Changes in applicable laws, regulations
and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be predicted
by management, yet such changes may have a material effect on
Key’s business, financial condition or results of
operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”)
under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies
are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or
industrial activities. KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries are also
subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by
applicable federal banking agencies. KeyCorp operates one
full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank
National Association (“KBNA”), and one national bank



subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a fiduciary.
Both of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries, and their
subsidiaries, are subject to regulation, supervision and
examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(the “OCC”). Because the deposits in KBNA are insured
(up to applicable limits) by the FDIC, the FDIC also has certain
regulatory and supervisory authority over KBNA.

KeyCorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are
subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
Federal Reserve Board, as well as other applicable state and
federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
For example, KeyCorp’s brokerage and asset management
subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the New York
Stock Exchange and/or state securities regulators, and
KeyCorp’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation
by the insurance regulatory authorities of the various states.
Other nonbank subsidiaries of KeyCorp are subject to laws and
regulations of both the federal government and the various
states in which they are authorized to do business.

Dividend Restrictions

The principal source of cash flow to KeyCorp, including cash
flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its
indebtedness, is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various
statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of
dividends that may be paid by KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries
without regulatory approval. The approval of the OCC is required
for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total
of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank
in any calendar year would exceed the total of: (i) the
bank’s net income for the current year plus (ii) the
retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation)
for the preceding two years, less any required transfer to
surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In
addition, a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent
of its undivided profits. KeyCorp’s national bank
subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
financial condition of the institution, could include the
payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), an
insured depository institution may not pay any dividend
(i) if payment would cause it to become less than
“adequately capitalized,” or (ii) while it is in
default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. See
“Regulatory Capital Standards and Related
Matters — Prompt Corrective Action” on page 6 of
this report. Also, the federal banking agencies have issued
policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured depository
institutions and their holding companies should generally pay
dividends only out of their current operating earnings.

Holding Company Structure

Bank Transactions With Affiliates.

Federal banking law
and regulation impose qualitative standards and quantitative
limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its
affiliates. Transactions covered by these provisions, which
include bank loans and other extensions of credit to affiliates,
bank purchases of assets from affiliates, and bank sales of
assets to affiliates, must be on arm’s length terms, cannot
exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to
the bank’s regulatory capital, and if a loan or other
extension of credit, must be secured by collateral in an amount
and quality expressly prescribed by statute. For these purposes,
a bank includes certain of its subsidiaries and other companies
it is deemed to control, while an affiliate includes the
bank’s parent bank holding company, certain of its nonbank
subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control, and
certain other companies. As a result, these provisions
materially restrict the ability of KBNA, as a bank, to fund its
affiliates including KeyCorp, McDonald Investments Inc., any of
the Victory mutual funds, and KeyCorp’s nonbanking
subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under Federal Reserve Board
policy, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source
of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary
banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources
to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be
required at a



time when KeyCorp may not have the resources to provide it or
would choose not to provide it. Certain loans by a bank holding
company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment
to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the
subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the
event of its bankruptcy, any commitment by a bank holding
company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the
capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy
trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The FDIA provides that, in the
event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an
insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors
(including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a
receiver would be afforded a priority over other general
unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal
funds and letters of credit. If an insured depository
institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with
the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit
creditors, including a parent holding company, in order of
priority of payment.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

Under the
FDIA, an insured depository institution which is under common
control with another insured depository institution is generally
liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be
incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of the
commonly controlled institution, or any assistance provided by
the FDIC to the commonly controlled institution which is in
danger of default. The term “default” is defined
generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver
and the term “in danger of default” is defined
generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that
a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of
regulatory assistance.

Regulatory Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory Capital.

Federal law
and regulation define and prescribe minimum levels of regulatory
capital for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries.
Adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the
federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision
process, and in the evaluation of applications in connection
with specific transactions and activities, including
acquisitions, expansion of existing activities, and commencement
of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These
guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to
risk-weighted assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1
capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are
calculated by assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories
of assets and off-balance-sheet exposures, based primarily on
counterparty credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1
capital by risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The
required minimum total risk-based capital ratio is currently
8.00%. It is calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1
capital and Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount
of Tier 1 capital), after deducting for investments in
certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal
holdings of capital instruments, by risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
preferred equity, and minority interests in the equity accounts
of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets
(including goodwill) and certain other assets. Tier 2
capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments,
perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, perpetual
preferred equity not includable in Tier 1 capital, and
limited amounts of term subordinated debt, medium-term preferred
equity, certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity
securities, and the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Bank holding companies, such as KeyCorp, whose securities and
commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are
required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk
includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign
exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad
market movements (such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or
commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as
idiosyncratic variation, event risk, and default risk). At
December 31, 2005, Key’s Tier 1 and total capital
to risk-weighted assets ratios were 7.59% and 11.47%,
respectively, which include required adjustments for market risk.



In addition to the risk-based standard, bank holding companies
are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s leverage ratio
guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
Tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage ratio,
calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average total
consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding companies that
either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented
the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for
market risk. All other bank holding companies must maintain a
minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. Neither KeyCorp nor
any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary
federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio
applicable to it. At December 31, 2005, Key’s
Tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 8.53%.

KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to
risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC,
which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal
Reserve Board on bank holding companies. At December 31,
2005, each of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries had
regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based and
leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
that are not taken into account in the computation of the
capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
organization. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has
advised KeyCorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any
specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratio applicable
to KeyCorp or such national bank subsidiary. Additional
information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in
the “Capital” section beginning on page 34 of the
Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to
Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Recourse Obligations, Direct Credit Substitutes, and Residual
Interests.

Specialized regulatory capital treatment is
prescribed for on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet
exposures consisting of recourse obligations, direct credit
substitutes, and residual interests that expose banking
organizations primarily to credit risk. This treatment includes
a concentration limit Tier 1 capital charge and a
dollar-for-dollar capital charge for certain types of residual
interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative
approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely
to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for
certain positions in asset securitizations.

Equity Investments in Nonfinancial Companies.

Specialized
regulatory capital treatment is prescribed for certain equity
investments made by banking organizations in companies engaged
in nonfinancial activities. This treatment imposes marginal
capital charges (applied by making deductions from Tier 1
capital) that increase as the banking organization’s
aggregate carrying amount of its covered equity investments
increase in relation to its Tier 1 capital. Such capital
charges range from 8% to 25% as such aggregate carrying amount
increases from 15% to 25% of the banking organization’s
Tier 1 capital.

Subprime Lending.

The federal banking agencies have
heightened supervisory expectations with respect to required
levels of capital for institutions with subprime lending
programs. For these purposes, a subprime lending program is one
that targets borrowers with weakened credit histories or
questionable repayment capacity. In addition to regulatory
capital, subprime lending supervisory guidance addresses
supervisory expectations with respect to risk management, the
allowance for loan and lease losses, portfolio and transaction
level examination review, analysis, and classification, cure
program documentation, and predatory or abusive lending
practices.

While this guidance principally applies to institutions with
subprime lending programs having an aggregate credit exposure of
at least 25% of Tier 1 capital, federal bank examiners may
apply it to other subprime portfolios, such as those that are
experiencing rapid growth or adverse performance trends, those
that are administered by inexperienced management, and those
that possess inadequate or weak controls. For an institution
that has subprime lending portfolio exposure equal to 25% or
more of the institution’s Tier 1 capital, the
supervisory guidance indicates that examiners are likely to
require that institution to hold capital in an amount that is
1.5 to 3.0 times greater than what is required for a portfolio
of non-subprime assets of a similar



type. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has advised
Key of any capital deficiency under this guidance.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The “prompt corrective
action” provisions of the FDIA create a statutory framework
that applies a system of both discretionary and mandatory
supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of FDIC-insured
depository institutions. These provisions impose progressively
more restrictive constraints on operations, management, and
capital distributions of an institution as its regulatory
capital decreases, or in some cases, based on supervisory
information other than the institution’s capital level.
This framework and the authority it confers on the federal
banking agencies supplements other existing authority vested in
such agencies to initiate supervisory actions to address capital
deficiencies. Moreover, other provisions of law and regulation
employ regulatory capital level designations the same as or
similar to those established by the prompt corrective action
provisions both in imposing certain restrictions and limitations
and in conferring certain economic and other benefits upon
institutions. These include restrictions on brokered deposits,
FDIC deposit insurance limits on pass-through deposits, limits
on exposure to interbank liabilities, risk-based FDIC deposit
insurance premium assessments, and expedited action upon
regulatory applications.

FDIC-insured depository institutions are grouped into one of
five prompt corrective action capital categories —
well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized and critically
undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based,
total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the
relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well
capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution must have
a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.00% and a
Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.00% (3.00% if
it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent
examination). At December 31, 2005, KBNA, KeyCorp’s
only FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiary, met the
requirements for the “well capitalized” capital
category. An institution’s prompt corrective action capital
category, however, may not constitute an accurate representation
of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or
its bank subsidiaries, and should be considered in conjunction
with other available information regarding Key’s financial
condition and results of operations.

Basel Accords.

The current minimum risk-based capital
requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies
are based on a 1988 international accord
(“Basel I”) that was developed by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision currently having member central
bank and bank supervision authority representation from Belgium,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. In 2004, the Basel Committee published its
new capital framework document (“Basel II”)
governing the capital adequacy of large, internationally active
banking organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
management and measurement systems. Basel II is designed to
create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk
measurement and management processes and to better align minimum
capital requirements with the risks underlying activities
conducted by these organizations.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
supervisory review, and market discipline. The minimum capital
requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit,
operational, and market risk exposures of a banking
organization. The supervisory review pillar addresses the need
for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy
position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with
respect to its minimum capital requirement, as well as the need
for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and
respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy
assessment. The market discipline pillar imposes public
disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are
intended to allow market participants to assess key information
about the organization’s risk profile and its associated
level of capital.

The agencies are developing a notice of proposed rulemaking to
provide banking organizations with a more definitive proposal
for implementing Basel II in the U.S. They expect to
propose a revised Basel II transitional implementation
timeline beginning in January 2008 and ending in December 2011.
In addition, the agencies



have indicated that the Basel II proposal will not change
the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital
requirements.

The agencies are also developing a notice of proposed rulemaking
to update their existing Basel I risk-based capital standards in
order to enhance the risk-sensitivity of the capital charges, to
reflect changes in accounting standards and financial markets,
and to address competitive equity questions that may be raised
by U.S. implementation of Basel II. The agencies also
have indicated that the Basel I proposal will not change the
existing leverage capital requirements.

The agencies expect to publish both the Basel I and
Basel II proposed rulemaking notices in similar time frames
in 2006.

FDIC Deposit Insurance

Because substantially all of KBNA’s deposits are insured up
to applicable limits by the FDIC, KBNA is subject to deposit
insurance premium assessments by the FDIC to maintain the Bank
Insurance Fund (“BIF”) and the Savings Association
Insurance Fund (“SAIF”) of the FDIC. The FDIC has
adopted a risk-related deposit insurance assessment system under
which premiums, ranging in 2005 from zero to $.27 for each $100
of domestic deposits, are imposed based upon the depository
institution’s capitalization and federal supervisory
evaluation. KBNA in 2005 qualified for a deposit insurance
assessment rate of zero. The FDIC is authorized to increase
deposit insurance premium assessments in certain circumstances.
Any such increase would have an adverse effect on Key’s
results of operations.

In February 2006, comprehensive deposit insurance reform
legislation was enacted. Under this legislation, BIF and SAIF
will be merged into a single Deposit Insurance Fund
(“DIF”), deposit insurance for certain retirement
accounts will increase from $100,000 to $250,000, deposit
insurance limits for accounts will be subject to an indexing
mechanism for future increases in coverage limits, and the fixed
1.25% reserve ratios for BIF and SAIF under current law will be
replaced by a reserve ratio for DIF which will be set annually
by the FDIC within a reserve ratio range of between 1.15% and
1.50%. The legislation also authorizes the FDIC to revise the
current risk-based deposit insurance premium assessment system
and to prescribe DIF restoration plans in the event that the DIF
reserve ratio were to fall below 1.15%. It also authorizes
certain premium assessment credits and, under certain
circumstances, requires certain DIF dividends. Since
implementation of this legislation requires FDIC rulemaking,
which is not required to be complete until November 2006, the
financial impact of this legislation upon insured depository
institutions, including KBNA, cannot yet be determined.

Financial Modernization Legislation

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”)
authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions.
The GLBA repealed significant provisions of the Glass -
Steagall Act to permit commercial banks to, among other things,
have affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make
merchant banking investments. The GLBA modified the BHCA to
permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified
standards (known as “financial holding companies”) to
engage in a broader range of financial activities than
previously permitted under the BHCA, and allowed subsidiaries of
commercial banks that meet certain specified standards (known as
“financial subsidiaries”) to engage in a wide range of
financial activities that are prohibited to such banks
themselves. In 2000, KeyCorp elected to become a financial
holding company. Under the authority conferred by the GLBA, Key
has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity
investments in nonfinancial companies, operate its McDonald
Investments Inc. subsidiary with fewer operating restrictions,
and acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in real estate
leasing and insurance agency activities without geographic
restriction.

The GLBA also established new privacy protections for customers
of financial institutions. Under federal law, a financial
institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy
policies and practices, describe the conditions under which the
financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal
information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties, and
provide an “opt-out” method for consumers to prevent
the financial institution from disclosing that information to
non-affiliated third parties.



The GLBA repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings
associations from the definitions of “broker” and
“dealer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”), and replaced this full exception
with functional exceptions. Under the statute, institutions that
engage in securities activities either must conduct those
activities through a registered broker-dealer or conform their
securities activities to those which qualify for functional
exceptions. While the requirements relating to dealer
registration became effective in September 2003, the SEC has
delayed the effective date of the requirements relating to
broker registration until September 2006 at the earliest.

USA PATRIOT Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(the “USA PATRIOT Act”) and the federal regulations
issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing
anti-money laundering law and regulation, increase compliance,
due diligence and reporting obligations for financial
institutions, create new crimes and penalties, and require the
federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other
acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the
parties in combating money laundering activities.

In October 2005, KBNA consented to the issuance of a consent
order (“Order”) from the OCC pursuant to which KBNA is
required to improve its compliance and operations infrastructure
designed, pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), to
detect and prevent money laundering. As part of the Order, KBNA
has agreed to strengthen its BSA internal controls, including
the development and implementation of enhanced policies and
procedures for BSA compliance; to enhance its programs and
controls for Suspicious Activity Reporting; to enhance its BSA
audit functions and its independent audit program; and to
improve employee training relating to the detection and
prevention of money laundering. At the same time, KeyCorp
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (“FRB”)
covering compliance with the BSA and other related matters.
Neither the OCC nor the FRB imposed a fine or civil money
penalty in connection with these actions.

KeyCorp and KBNA have taken significant steps to strengthen the
organizations’ compliance policies and procedures, and
operations infrastructure in areas related to those specified in
the Order and the MOU, as well as in other respects. Management
is committed to ensuring that all of the requirements of these
regulatory actions are met.

Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003
(“FACT Act”) imposes new requirements on financial
institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit
bureaus. The FACT Act also allows customers to choose to opt out
of having certain information shared across a financial
institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes.
Compliance with the FACT Act requires Key to modify numerous
computer systems and to make operational changes in several
business areas. Key believes that the changes that it has
already made or will implement in 2006 will satisfy the material
requirements of the FACT Act and the current regulations
implementing it. Although additional FACT Act implementing
regulations are still pending that may mandate additional
disclosures or impose system or process changes, Key believes
that it will be able to implement any new regulatory
requirements within the time frames provided.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent
to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that
management believes affect us are described below. Before making
an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks
and uncertainties described below together with all of the other
information included or incorporated by reference in this
report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the
only ones we face. Although we have significant risk management
policies, procedures and verification processes in place,
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware
of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial
may also impair our business operations. This report is
qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.



If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our
common shares could decline, perhaps significantly, and you
could lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Related To Our Business

We Are Subject To Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
control, including general economic conditions and policies of
various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular,
the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including
changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount
of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest
we pay on deposits and other borrowings.

Although management believes it has implemented effective asset
and liability management strategies, including the use of
derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential
effects of changes in interest rates on our results of
operations, any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change
in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Additional
information regarding interest rate risk is included in the
section captioned “Risk Management — Market risk
management — Interest rate risk management”
beginning on page 38 of the Financial Review section of
KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are Subject To Other Market Risk In Addition To
    Interest Rate Risk

The values of some financial instruments vary not only with
changes in market interest rates, but also with changes in
foreign exchange rates, factors influencing valuations in the
equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or
prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline
if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the
U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other
currencies. When the value of an instrument is tied to such
external factors, the holder faces “market risk.”

Although management believes it has implemented effective
strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit
spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolio, any
substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in those factors
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations. Additional information regarding
market risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
Management — Market risk management —
Trading portfolio risk management” beginning on page 41 of
the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual
Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are Subject To Credit Risk

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could
adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding
loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. We
also are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our
lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and
regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action
that could result in the assessment against us of civil money or
other penalties.



As of December 31, 2005, approximately 69.8% of our loan
portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
types of loans (and leases) are generally viewed as potentially
having more risk of default than residential real estate loans
or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically
larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans.
Although we closely monitor, and manage, risk concentrations and
utilize various portfolio management practices to limit
excessive concentrations when it is feasible to do so, our loan
portfolio still does contain a number of commercial loans with
relatively large balances. The deterioration of one or a few of
these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing
loans, and an increase in non-performing loans could result in a
net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the
provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan
charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations. Additional
information regarding credit risk is included in the section
captioned “Risk Management — Credit risk
management” beginning on page 42 of the Financial
Review section of KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to
Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Various Factors May Cause Our Allowance For Possible Loan
    Losses To Increase

We maintain an allowance for possible loan losses, which is a
reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses
charged to expense, that represents management’s estimate
of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The
allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to
reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan
portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s
continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific
credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio
quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions;
and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.
The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for
possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of
subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of
current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo
material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting
borrowers, new information regarding existing loans,
identification of additional problem loans and other factors,
both within and outside of our control, may require an increase
in the allowance for possible loan losses. In addition, bank
regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically
review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase
in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of
further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ
somewhat from those of our own management. In addition, if
charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible
loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the
allowance for possible loan losses. Additional provisions to
increase the allowance for possible loan losses, should they
become necessary, would result in a decrease in net income and
capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. Additional information
regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the
section captioned “Risk Management — Credit risk
management — Allowance for loan losses” beginning
on page 42 of the Financial Review section of
KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are Subject To Liquidity Risk

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
level or cost of liquidity, affecting our ongoing ability to
accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
without adverse consequences. Although management has
implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse
sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as
unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both
normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected
and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. Additional information regarding
liquidity risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
Management — Liquidity risk management” beginning
on page 46 of the Financial Review section of
KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto).



We Are Subject To Operational Risk

We, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, which
represents the risk of loss resulting from human error,
inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
(legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of,
or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
practices or ethical standards. Although we seek to mitigate
operational risk through a system of internal controls,
resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of
explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our
reputation or forgone opportunities, any and all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. Additional information regarding
operational risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
Management — Operational risk management”
beginning on page 48 of the Financial Review section of
KeyCorp’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders
(Exhibit 13 hereto).

Our Profitability Depends Significantly On Economic
    Conditions In The Geographic Regions In Which We Operate

Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions
of the markets in which we operate. Although we are somewhat
geographically diversified, assisted in part in this respect by
our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and
equipment leasing lines of business, we still do have
concentrations of loans and other business activities in
geographic areas where our KeyCenters are principally
located — the Midwest, Northeast and Pacific
Northwest. The regional economic conditions in these areas have
an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as
the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the
collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit
funding sources. A significant decline in general economic
conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism,
outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic
occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or
other factors could also impact these regional economies and, in
turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

We Operate In A Highly Competitive Industry And Market
    Areas

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
operate. However, we also face competition from many other types
of financial institutions, including, without limitation,
savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies,
finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
other local, regional and national financial services firms. The
financial services industry could become even more competitive
as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes
and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered
barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer
products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
factors, including, among other things:



Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

We Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And
    Supervision

We, primarily through KBNA and certain of its non-bank
subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state
regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily
intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit
insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not
shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices,
capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and
growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory
agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and
policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations
or regulatory policies; changes in the interpretation or
implementation of statutes, regulations or policies; and/or
continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and
unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
costs, limit the types of financial services and products that
we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer
competing financial services and products, among other things.
Failure to appropriately comply with laws, regulations or
policies (including internal policies and procedures designed to
prevent such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additional information
regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section
captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1.
Business, beginning on page 2 of this report.

Our Controls And Procedures May Fail Or Be
    Circumvented

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls,
disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance
policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions
and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that
the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or
circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to
comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We Rely On Dividends From Our Subsidiaries For Most Of Our
    Revenue

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from
dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the
principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares
and interest and principal on our debt. Various laws and
regulations limit the amount of dividends that KBNA and certain
non-bank subsidiaries may pay to KeyCorp. Also, KeyCorp’s
right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a
subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to
the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the
event KBNA is unable to pay dividends to KeyCorp, we may not be
able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our
common shares. The inability to receive dividends from KBNA
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additional information
regarding dividend restrictions is included in the section
captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1.
Business, on page 3 of this report.

Potential Acquisitions May Disrupt Our Business And Dilute
    Shareholder Value

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
other things:



We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
conduct due diligence activities related to possible
transactions with other financial institutions and financial
services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve
the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,
therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
income per common share may occur in connection with any future
transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected
revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or
product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an
acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

We May Not Be Able To Attract And Retain Skilled
    People

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not
be able to hire or retain the people we want and/or need.
Although we maintain employment agreements with certain key
employees, and have incentive compensation plans aimed, in part,
at long-term employee retention, the unexpected loss of services
of one or more of our key personnel could still occur, and such
events may have a material adverse impact on our business
because of the loss of the employee’s skills, knowledge of
our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of
promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.

Our Information Systems May Experience An Interruption Or
    Breach In Security

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in
security of these systems could result in failures or
disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies
and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or,
if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The
occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches
of our information systems could damage our reputation, result
in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional
regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and
possible financial liability, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

We Continually Encounter Technological Change

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
technological change with frequent introductions of new
technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
technology increases efficiency and enables financial
institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our
future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
implement new technology-driven products and services or be
successful in marketing these products and services to our
customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological
change affecting the financial services industry could have a
material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
financial condition and results of operations.



We Are Subject To Claims And Litigation

From time to time, customers and/or vendors may make claims and
take legal action against us. Whether these claims and legal
action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal
actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in
significant financial liability and/or adversely affect how the
market perceives us and our products and services as well as
impact customer demand for those products and services. Any
financial liability or reputation damage could have a material
adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

Our Earnings May Be Affected By Changes In Accounting
    Principles And In Tax Laws

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
could have a significant adverse effect on Key’s reported
financial results. Although these changes may not have an
economic impact on our business, they could affect our ability
to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures.

We, like all businesses, are subject to tax laws, rules and
regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or
other governmental bodies, could affect us in substantial and
unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
costs, among other things. Failure to appropriately comply with
tax laws, rules and regulations could result in sanctions by
regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation
damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Severe Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or
    Terrorism And Other External Events Could Significantly Impact
    Our Business

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses.
For example, during 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused
extensive flooding and destruction along the coastal areas of
the Gulf of Mexico. While we were not significantly and
adversely affected by the impact of these specific disasters,
other severe weather or natural disasters, acts of war or
terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the
future that do have an effect on our business. Although
management has established disaster recovery plans and
procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a
material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.

Risks Associated With Our Common Shares

Our Share Price Can Be Volatile

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find
attractive. Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
response to a variety of factors including, among other things:



General market fluctuations, industry factors and general
economic and political conditions and events, such as economic
slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss
trends, could also cause our share price to decrease regardless
of operating results.

An Investment In Our Common Shares Is Not An Insured
    Deposit

Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not
insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our
common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in
this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you
acquire our common shares, you may lose some or all of your
investment.

Our Articles Of Incorporation, Regulations And
    Shareholders Rights Plan As Well As Certain Banking Laws May
    Have An Anti-Takeover Effect

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations,
federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
requirements, and our stock purchase rights plan could make it
more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The
combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated
merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could
adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Risks Associated With Our Industry

The Earnings Of Financial Services Companies Are
    Significantly Affected By General Business And Economic
    Conditions

Our operations and profitability are impacted by general
business and economic conditions in the United States and
abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term
interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues,
legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt
and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and
finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local
economies in which we operate, all of which are beyond our
control. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in
an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets,
decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for
our products and services, among other things, any of which
could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Financial Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy And
    Completeness Of Information About Customers And
    Counterparties

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
may also rely on representations of those customers,
counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
statements, credit reports or other financial information could
have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
financial condition and results of operations.

Consumers May Decide Not To Use Banks To Complete Their
    Financial Transactions

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
through alternative methods financial transactions that
historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
maintain funds in



brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically
been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete
transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds
directly without the assistance of banks. The process of
eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
“disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.
