ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
    is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It is a bank holding
    company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding
    Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and is one
    of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services
    companies, with consolidated total assets of
    $104.531 billion at December 31, 2008. KeyCorp is the
    parent holding company for KeyBank National Association
    (“KeyBank”), its principal subsidiary, through which
    most of its banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and
    certain other subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides a wide range of
    retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment
    management, consumer finance and investment banking products and
    services to individual, corporate and institutional clients
    through two major business groups, Community Banking and
    National Banking. As of December 31, 2008, these services
    were provided across the country through KeyBank’s 986
    full-service retail banking branches (“branches”) in
    fourteen states, additional offices, a telephone banking call
    center services group and a network of 1,478 automated teller
    machines (“ATMs”) in sixteen states. Additional
    information pertaining to KeyCorp’s two business groups is
    included in the “Line of Business Results” section
    beginning on page 28 and in Note 4 (“Line of Business
    Results”) beginning on page 88 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto) and is incorporated herein by
    reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries had an average of
    18,095 full-time-equivalent employees during 2008.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
    deposits and making loans, KeyCorp’s bank and trust company
    subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
    personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
    management services, investment banking and capital markets
    products, and international banking services. Through its
    subsidiary banks, trust company and registered investment
    adviser subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides investment management
    services to clients that include large corporate and public
    retirement plans, foundations and endowments,

high-net-worth

individuals and multiemployer trust funds established for
    providing pension, vacation or other benefits to employees.

KeyCorp provides other financial services — both
    within and outside of its primary banking markets
    — through nonbank subsidiaries. These services include
    accident, health, and credit-life insurance on loans made by
    KeyBank, principal investing, community development financing,
    securities underwriting and brokerage, and merchant services.
    KeyCorp is an equity participant in a joint venture that
    provides merchant services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks
    and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
    security holders and its creditors to participate in any
    distribution of the assets or earnings of KeyCorp’s banks
    and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the
    respective creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries,
    except to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity
    as creditor of such banks and other subsidiaries may be
    recognized.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 3 (“Acquisitions and
    Divestitures”) on page 87 of the Financial Review section
    of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto) is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
    competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
    compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
    holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
    credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
    mutual funds, insurance companies,



investment management firms, investment banking firms,
    broker-dealers and other local, regional and national
    institutions that offer financial services. Key competes by
    offering quality products and innovative services at competitive
    prices.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
    concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive
    pressure on Key’s core banking products and services.
    Consolidation efforts intensified during 2008 as the challenges
    of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to
    redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to
    stronger and larger financial institutions. Financial
    institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and the
    deposits and certain banking assets of the 26 banks that failed
    during 2008 were redistributed through the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) least-cost
    resolution process. These factors intensified the concentration
    of the industry and placed increased competitive pressure on
    Key’s core banking products and services.

The competitive landscape was also affected by the conversion of
    traditional investment banks to bank holding companies. The
    challenges of the liquidity crisis increased the desirability of
    the bank holding company structure due to the access it provides
    to government-sponsored sources of liquidity, such as the
    discount window and other programs designed specifically for
    bank holding companies and certain of their affiliates. The
    financial modernization legislation enacted in November 1999,
    which permits commercial bank affiliates to have affiliates that
    underwrite and deal in securities, underwrite insurance and make
    merchant banking investments under certain conditions, has
    enabled many of the more recent structural and regulatory
    changes. These structural and regulatory changes intensified the
    competitive landscape within which Key competes, since
    additional institutions now have access to low cost funding. For
    additional information on the financial modernization
    legislation, see “Financial Modernization Legislation”
    on page 9 of this report.

Supervision
    and Regulation

The following discussion addresses certain material elements of
    the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies
    and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information
    regarding Key. This regulatory framework is intended primarily
    to protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund
    (the “DIF”) of the FDIC and the banking system as a
    whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of
    security holders.

Set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws,
    regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to Key.
    This discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is
    qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
    statutes, regulations and regulatory agency policies to which
    this discussion refers. Changes in the applicable laws,
    regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be
    predicted by management, yet such changes may have a material
    effect on Key’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”)
    under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
    in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
    all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies
    are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or
    industrial activities.

KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries are also subject to extensive
    regulation, supervision and examination by applicable federal
    banking agencies. KeyCorp operates one full-service,
    FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and one national
    bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to those of a
    fiduciary. Both of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries and
    their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and
    examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
    (the “OCC”). Because domestic deposits in KeyBank are
    insured (up to applicable limits) and certain deposits of
    KeyBank and debt obligations of KeyBank and KeyCorp are
    temporarily guaranteed (up to applicable limits) by the FDIC,
    the FDIC also has certain regulatory and supervisory authority
    over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
    (the “FDIA”).



KeyCorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are
    subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve Board, as well as other applicable state and
    federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
    For example, KeyCorp’s brokerage and asset management
    subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the
    SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and state
    securities regulators, and KeyCorp’s insurance subsidiaries
    are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
    authorities of the various states. Other nonbank subsidiaries of
    KeyCorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they are authorized
    to do business.

Dividend
    Restrictions

On November 14, 2008, KeyCorp sold $2.5 billion of
    Fixed-Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B
    (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and a Warrant to
    purchase 35,244,361 common shares, par value $1.00 (the
    “Common Shares”) to the United States Department of
    the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) in conjunction
    with its Capital Purchase Program. The terms of the transaction
    with the U.S. Treasury include limitations on
    KeyCorp’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase Common
    Shares. For three years after the issuance or until the
    U.S. Treasury no longer holds any Series B Preferred
    Stock, KeyCorp will not be able to increase its dividends above
    the level paid in the third quarter of 2008, nor will KeyCorp be
    permitted to repurchase any of its Common Shares or preferred
    stock without the approval of the U.S. Treasury, subject to
    the availability of certain limited exceptions (

e.g.,

for
    purchases in connection with benefit plans). The Federal Reserve
    Board also advised in its February 24, 2009 Supervisory
    Letter SR

09-04

that
    recipients of CPP funds should communicate reasonably in advance
    with Federal Reserve Board staff concerning how any proposed
    dividends, capital redemptions and capital repurchases are
    consistent with the requirements of CPP, and discouraged bank
    holding companies from using proceeds of the CPP to pay
    dividends on trust preferred securities or repay debt
    obligations.

In addition, various statutory and regulatory provisions limit
    the amount of dividends that may be paid to KeyCorp by its bank
    subsidiaries without regulatory approval. Historically,
    dividends paid to KeyCorp by KeyBank have been an important
    source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity
    securities and interest on its debt. The approval of the OCC is
    required for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if
    the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of
    such bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of:
    (i) the bank’s net income for the current year plus
    (ii) the retained net income (as defined and interpreted by
    regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
    transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any
    preferred stock. In addition, a national bank can pay dividends
    only to the extent of its undivided profits. KeyCorp’s
    national bank subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions.
    During 2008, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to KeyCorp;
    nonbank subsidiaries paid KeyCorp a total of $113,234 in
    dividends. As of the close of business on December 31,
    2008, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to
    KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a
    net loss of $1.161 billion for 2008. During 2008, KeyCorp
    made capital infusions of $1.6 billion into KeyBank in the
    form of cash. At December 31, 2008, KeyCorp held
    $4.756 billion in short-term investments, the funds from
    which can be used to pay dividends, service debt, and finance
    corporate operations.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
    institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
    engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
    financial condition of the institution, could include the
    payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
    institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
    FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
    depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
    level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
    the FDIA, an insured depository institution may not pay any
    dividend (i) if payment would cause it to become less than
    “adequately capitalized” or (ii) while it is in
    default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. See
    “Federal Deposit Insurance Act — Prompt
    Corrective Action” beginning on page 8. Also, the
    federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that
    provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their
    holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of
    their current operating earnings.

American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

On February 13, 2009, the House of Representatives and the
    Senate passed the economic stimulus bill known as the
    “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.”
    President Obama signed the bill into law on Tuesday,
    February 17, 2009. The bill contains provisions that will
    affect institutions that received or will receive financial



assistance under the Capital Purchase Program. KeyCorp is
    currently reviewing the requirements and will make any necessary
    revisions to its policies and procedures to ensure compliance
    with applicable law.

Holding
    Company Structure

Bank Transactions With Affiliates.

Federal
    banking law and the regulations promulgated thereunder impose
    qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain
    transactions by a bank with its affiliates. Transactions covered
    by these provisions, which include bank loans and other
    extensions of credit to affiliates, bank purchases of assets
    from affiliates, and bank sales of assets to affiliates, must be
    on arm’s length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts,
    determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital,
    and if a loan or other extension of credit, must be secured by
    collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by
    statute. For these purposes, a bank includes certain of its
    subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control, while
    an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding
    company, certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies
    it is deemed to control, and certain other companies. As a
    result, these provisions materially restrict the ability of
    KeyBank, as a bank, to fund its affiliates including KeyCorp,
    KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds,
    most of the Austin Capital funds, and KeyCorp’s nonbanking
    subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under Federal
    Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to
    serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each
    of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to
    commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This
    support may be required at a time when KeyCorp may not have the
    resources to, or would choose not to, provide it. Certain loans
    by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate
    in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other
    indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law
    provides that in the event of its bankruptcy, any commitment by
    a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to
    maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
    bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Regulatory
    Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory
    Capital.

Federal law defines and prescribes
    minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding companies
    and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy of regulatory capital is
    assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the
    examination and supervision process, and in the evaluation of
    applications in connection with specific transactions and
    activities, including acquisitions, expansion of existing
    activities and commencement of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These
    guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to
    risk-weighted assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are
    calculated by assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories
    of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, based primarily on
    counterparty credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1
    capital by risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The
    required minimum total risk-based capital ratio is currently
    8.00%. It is calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount
    of Tier 1 capital), after certain deductions, by
    risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
    preferred equity (including the Series A Preferred Stock
    and the Series B Preferred Stock), and minority interests
    in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less certain
    intangible assets (including goodwill) and certain other assets.
    Tier 2 capital includes qualifying hybrid capital
    instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt
    securities, perpetual preferred equity not includable in
    Tier 1 capital, and limited amounts of term subordinated
    debt, medium-term preferred equity, certain unrealized holding
    gains on certain equity securities, and the allowance for loan
    and lease losses.

Bank holding companies, such as KeyCorp, whose securities and
    commodities trading activities exceed specified levels, also are
    required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk
    includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign
    exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad
    market movements (such as changes in the general level of
    interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or
    commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as
    idiosyncratic variation, event risk, and default risk). The
    federal banking agencies have developed and published for
    comment a proposed rule that would modify the existing market
    risk capital



requirements. The proposed rule would enhance modeling
    requirements consistent with advances in risk management,
    enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the
    current methodologies of the existing requirements, and modify
    the definition of covered position to better capture positions
    for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate.
    It would also impose an explicit capital requirement for
    incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time
    horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity,
    concentrations, hedging, and optionality. The proposed rule has
    not yet been adopted as a final rule. At December 31, 2008,
    Key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based
    requirements, including all required adjustments for market risk.

In addition to the risk-based standard, bank holding companies
    are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s leverage ratio
    guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage ratio,
    calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average total
    consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding companies that
    either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented
    the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for
    market risk. All other bank holding companies must maintain a
    minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. At December 31,
    2008, Key had regulatory capital in excess of all minimum
    leverage capital requirements.

KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC,
    which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal
    Reserve Board on bank holding companies. At December 31,
    2008, each of KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries had
    regulatory capital in excess of all minimum risk-based and
    leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
    to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
    that are not taken into account in the computation of the
    capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
    evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
    adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
    regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
    organization. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has
    advised KeyCorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any
    specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratio applicable
    to KeyCorp or such national bank subsidiary.

Basel Accords.

The current minimum risk-based
    capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking
    agencies are based on a 1988 international accord (“Basel
    I”) that was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking
    Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee published its new
    capital framework document (“Basel II”) governing the
    capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking
    organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
    management and measurement systems. Basel II is designed to
    create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk
    measurement and management processes and to better align minimum
    capital requirements with the risks underlying activities
    conducted by these organizations.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
    capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
    supervisory review, and market discipline. The minimum capital
    requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit,
    operational, and market risk exposures of a banking
    organization. The supervisory review pillar addresses the need
    for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy
    position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with
    respect to its minimum capital requirement, as well as the need
    for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and
    respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy
    assessment. The market discipline pillar imposes public
    disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are
    intended to allow market participants to assess key information
    about the organization’s risk profile and its associated
    level of capital.

In December 2007, the federal banking agencies issued a final
    rule to implement the advanced approaches framework of
    Basel II in the U.S. The rule was effective
    April 1, 2008, but implementation is subject to a
    multi-year transition period in which limits are imposed upon
    the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease. It
    does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective
    action and leverage capital requirements, and explicitly
    reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations
    to hold additional capital where appropriate. Application of the
    final rule to U.S. banking organizations is mandatory for
    some and optional for others. Currently, neither KeyCorp nor
    KeyBank is required to apply the final rule.

In July 2008, the agencies issued a proposed rule for
    implementing the standardized approach framework of Basel II.
    The proposal would provide an alternative approach to
    determining risk-based capital requirements for banking
    organizations that are not required to use the advanced
    approaches framework final rule published in



December 2007. While the advanced approaches framework is
    mandatory for large, internationally active banking
    organizations, the standardized approach framework would be
    optional for others (including KeyCorp and KeyBank), which could
    also choose to remain under the Basel I framework.

Federal
    Deposit Insurance Act

Deposit Insurance Coverage Limits.

Prior to
    enactment of the EESA, the FDIC standard maximum depositor
    insurance coverage limit was $100,000, excluding certain
    retirement accounts qualifying for a maximum coverage limit of
    $250,000. Pursuant to the EESA, the FDIC standard maximum
    coverage limit has been temporarily increased to $250,000
    through December 31, 2009. As provided in the EESA, this
    temporary standard maximum coverage limit increase expires on
    January 1, 2010, and is not to be taken into account by the
    FDIC for purposes of setting deposit insurance assessments.

Deposit Insurance Assessments.

Substantially
    all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to
    applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, KeyBank is subject
    to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. Under
    current law, the FDIC is required to maintain the DIF reserve
    ratio within the range of 1.15% to 1.50% of estimated insured
    deposits. Because the DIF reserve ratio fell and was expected to
    remain below 1.15%, the FDIA required the FDIC to establish and
    implement a restoration plan to restore the DIF reserve ratio to
    at least 1.15% within five years, absent extraordinary
    circumstances. The FDIC has invoked the extraordinary
    circumstances provision under the FDIA to allow the restoration
    plan for the DIF to be extended to seven years. Consequently,
    and depending upon an institution’s risk category, for the
    first quarter of 2009 annualized deposit insurance assessments
    will range from $.12 to $.50 for each $100 of assessable
    domestic deposits, as compared with $.05 to $.43 throughout
    2008. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC Board of Directors
    approved an emergency special assessment of 20 basis points
    on all insured depository institutions on June 30, 2009, to
    be collected on September 30, 2009. The interim rule would
    also allow the FDIC Board to impose an emergency special
    assessment of 10 basis points if necessary to maintain
    public confidence. Moreover, under a new risk-based assessment
    system that is to be implemented in the second quarter of 2009,
    annualized deposit insurance assessments would range from $.07
    to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on
    the institution’s risk category. At December 31, 2008,
    the unused portion of the one-time premium assessment credit
    available to Key under deposit insurance reform legislation
    enacted in 2006 was approximately $3.9 million. The
    remainder of Key’s one-time premium assessment credit is
    expected to be utilized during the first quarter of 2009.

FICO Assessments.

Since 1997, all FDIC-insured
    depository institutions have been required through assessments
    collected by the FDIC to service the annual interest on

30-year

noncallable bonds issued by the Financing Corporation
    (“FICO”) in the late 1980s to fund losses incurred by
    the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO
    assessments are separate from and in addition to deposit
    insurance assessments, are adjusted quarterly and, unlike
    deposit insurance assessments, are assessed uniformly without
    regard to an institution’s risk category. Throughout 2008,
    the annualized FICO assessment rate ranged from $.011 to $.014
    for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits.

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.

In
    October 2008, the FDIC, with the written concurrence of the
    Federal Reserve Board, made a systemic risk recommendation to
    the Secretary of the Treasury, who in consultation with the
    President determined that the systemic risk exception to the
    least-cost resolution provision under the FDIA should be
    invoked. Consequently, and in order to avoid or mitigate serious
    adverse effects on economic conditions and financial stability,
    the FDIC established and by final regulation implemented its
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”).

Under the TLGP regulation, the FDIC will temporarily guarantee
    the unpaid principal and interest due under a limited amount of
    qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating
    eligible entities (the “Debt Guarantee”) as well as
    all depositor funds in qualifying noninterest-bearing
    transaction accounts maintained at participating FDIC-insured
    depository institutions (the “Transaction Account
    Guarantee”). For FDIC-guaranteed debt issued on or before
    June 30, 2009, the Debt Guarantee expires on the earlier of
    the maturity of the debt or June 30, 2012. The Transaction
    Account Guarantee expires on January 1, 2010. The U.S.
    Treasury, in conjunction with other banking regulators, has
    announced an intention to extend the TLGP as part of its
    Financial Stability Plan. Details as to how the extension
    through October 31, 2009 would be implemented have not been
    announced.



Participants in the TLGP are subject to certain assessments by
    the FDIC. Assessments on participants under the Debt Guarantee
    part of the TLGP are computed by multiplying the amount of their
    FDIC-guaranteed debt by annualized rates which, depending on the
    type of issuer entity and the maturity of such debt, range from
    50 to 110 basis points. In addition, participants under the
    Debt Guarantee part of the TLGP that have elected to have
    flexibility, before exceeding their FDIC-guaranteed debt limit,
    to issue senior unsecured debt not guaranteed by the FDIC and
    maturing beyond June 30, 2012, are assessed an additional
    one-time, nonrefundable fee. Such fee is computed by multiplying
    the participant’s qualifying senior unsecured debt
    outstanding as of September 30, 2008, and maturing no later
    than June 30, 2009 (or if no such debt was outstanding as
    of September 30, 2008, then the amount of the
    participant’s FDIC-guaranteed debt limit) by
    37.5 basis points. Assessments on participants under the
    Transaction Account Guarantee part of the TLGP are computed by
    multiplying qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction account
    balances in excess of $250,000 by an annualized 10 basis
    point rate. Moreover, to the extent that participant assessments
    are insufficient to cover the expenses or losses to DIF arising
    from the TLGP, the FDIA requires the FDIC to impose one or more
    emergency special assessments on all FDIC-insured depository
    institutions. Each such special assessment will be computed with
    reference to the amount by which an insured depository
    institution’s average total assets exceed the sum of the
    institution’s average total tangible equity and average
    total subordinated debt.

KeyCorp is a participant in the Debt Guarantee component of the
    TLGP. KeyBank is a participant in both the Transaction Account
    Guarantee and the Debt Guarantee components of the TLGP,
    including the special election to issue long-term, senior
    unsecured debt not guaranteed by the FDIC. As of
    December 31, 2008, KeyCorp had $500 million of
    guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP and KeyBank had
    $1.0 billion of guaranteed debt outstanding under the TLGP.

Liability of Commonly Controlled
    Institutions.

Under the FDIA, an insured
    depository institution which is under common control with
    another insured depository institution generally is liable to
    the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be
    incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of any such
    commonly controlled institution, or any assistance provided by
    the FDIC to the commonly controlled institution which is in
    danger of default. The term “default” is defined
    generally to mean the appointment of a conservator or receiver
    and the term “in danger of default” is defined
    generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that
    a “default” is likely to occur in the absence of
    regulatory assistance.

Conservatorship and Receivership of
    Institutions.

If any insured depository
    institution becomes insolvent and the FDIC is appointed its
    conservator or receiver, the FDIC may, under federal law,
    disaffirm or repudiate any contract to which such institution is
    a party, if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract
    would be burdensome, and that disaffirmance or repudiation of
    the contract would promote the orderly administration of the
    institution’s affairs. Such disaffirmance or repudiation
    would result in a claim by its holder against the receivership
    or conservatorship. The amount paid upon such claim would depend
    upon, among other factors, the amount of receivership assets
    available for the payment of such claim and its priority
    relative to the priority of others. In addition, the FDIC as
    conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into
    by the institution notwithstanding any provision providing for
    termination, default, acceleration, or exercise of rights upon
    or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution,
    appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or
    exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for
    the institution. The FDIC as conservator or receiver also may
    transfer any asset or liability of the institution without
    obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s
    shareholders or creditors.

Least-Cost Resolution.

In attempting to
    resolve the problems of an insured institution in default or in
    danger of default, in general the FDIC is required to satisfy
    the institution’s obligations to insured depositors at the
    least cost to DIF and not to take any action that would have the
    effect of increasing the losses to DIF by protecting depositors
    for more than the insured portion of deposits or by protecting
    creditors other than depositors.

Depositor Preference.

The FDIA provides that,
    in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an
    insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors
    (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors)
    and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as
    receiver would be afforded a priority over other general
    unsecured claims against such an institution. If an insured
    depository institution fails, insured and uninsured



depositors along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of
    unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including a parent holding
    company and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of
    payment.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The “prompt
    corrective action” provisions of the FDIA create a
    statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary
    and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level
    of FDIC-insured depository institutions. These provisions impose
    progressively more restrictive constraints on operations,
    management, and capital distributions of the institution as its
    regulatory capital decreases, or in some cases, based on
    supervisory information other than the institution’s
    capital level. This framework and the authority it confers on
    the federal banking agencies supplements other existing
    authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory
    actions to address capital deficiencies. Moreover, other
    provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level
    designations the same as or similar to those established by the
    prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain
    restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic
    and other benefits upon institutions. These include restrictions
    on brokered deposits, limits on exposure to interbank
    liabilities, determination of risk-based FDIC deposit insurance
    premium assessments, and action upon regulatory applications.

FDIC-insured depository institutions are grouped into one of
    five prompt corrective action capital categories —
    well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
    significantly undercapitalized and critically
    undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based,
    total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the
    relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well
    capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
    least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
    6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
    and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
    directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution must have
    a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.00% and a
    Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.00% (3.00% if
    it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent
    examination) and is not well capitalized. An institution’s
    prompt corrective action capital category, however, may not
    constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial
    condition or prospects of the institution or its parent bank
    holding company, and should be considered in conjunction with
    other available information regarding the financial condition
    and results of operations of the institution and its parent bank
    holding company. KeyBank is well-capitalized pursuant to the
    prompt corrective action guidelines.

Financial
    Modernization Legislation

The provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the
    “GLBA”) authorized new activities for qualifying
    financial institutions. The GLBA repealed significant provisions
    of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit commercial banks, among
    other things, to have affiliates that underwrite and deal in
    securities and make merchant banking investments. The GLBA
    modified the BHCA to permit bank holding companies that meet
    certain specified standards (known as “financial holding
    companies”) to engage in a broader range of financial
    activities than previously permitted under the BHCA, and allowed
    subsidiaries of commercial banks that meet certain specified
    standards (known as “financial subsidiaries”) to
    engage in a wide range of financial activities that are
    prohibited to such banks themselves. In 2000, KeyCorp elected to
    become a financial holding company. Under the authority
    conferred by the GLBA, KeyCorp has been able to expand the
    nature and scope of its equity investments in nonfinancial
    companies, acquire its Victory Capital Advisers Inc. subsidiary,
    operate its KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. subsidiary with fewer
    operating restrictions, and establish financial subsidiaries to
    engage more efficiently in certain activities.

In order for a company to maintain its status as a financial
    holding company under the GLBA, its depository institution
    subsidiaries must remain well capitalized (as defined under the
    prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA) and well
    managed (as determined by the depository institution’s
    primary regulator). If any of the depository institution
    subsidiaries of a financial holding company fail to satisfy
    these criteria, the holding company must enter into an agreement
    with the Federal Reserve Board setting forth a plan to correct
    the deficiencies. If these deficiencies are not corrected within
    a

180-day

period, the Federal Reserve Board may order the financial
    holding company to divest its depository institution
    subsidiaries. Alternatively, the holding company could retain
    its depository institution subsidiaries but would have to cease
    engaging in any activities that are permissible under the GLBA
    but were not permissible for a bank holding company prior to the
    enactment of that statute. In addition, if a depository
    institution subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a
    less than satisfactory rating under the



Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the holding
    company will not be permitted to commence new activities or make
    new acquisitions in reliance on the GLBA until the CRA rating of
    the subsidiary improves to being at least satisfactory.

The GLBA also established new privacy protections for customers
    of financial institutions. Under federal law, a financial
    institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy
    policies and practices, describe the conditions under which the
    financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal
    information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties, and
    provide an “opt-out” method for consumers to prevent
    the financial institution from disclosing that information to
    nonaffiliated third parties.

USA
    PATRIOT Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) and the federal regulations
    issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing
    anti-money laundering law and regulation, increase compliance,
    due diligence and reporting obligations for financial
    institutions, create new crimes and penalties, and require the
    federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other
    acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the
    parties in combating money laundering activities.

Fair and
    Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the
    “FACT Act”) imposes new requirements on financial
    institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit
    bureaus. The FACT Act also allows customers to choose to opt-out
    of having certain information shared across a financial
    institution’s affiliates for marketing solicitation
    purposes. Final regulations were issued in 2007 concerning the
    details of this marketing opt-out. Key implemented a marketing
    use opt-out three years ago, which Key believes satisfies the
    material requirements of this opt-out rule. In addition, on
    October 31, 2007, the federal financial regulatory agencies
    together issued final regulations (the “Red Flag
    Guidelines”) implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the
    FACT Act. The Red Flag Guidelines require Key to develop and
    implement an identify theft protection program for covered
    accounts. The identity theft program was in place by the
    required November 1, 2008 deadline. Compliance with the Red
    Flag Guidelines requires Key to have a formal program in place
    that identifies threats, assesses risk, prioritizes gaps,
    remediates high risk gaps and provides board level reporting.
    Key believes that it has implemented an identity theft program,
    as required by the Red Flag Guidelines, and achieved regulatory
    requirements.

Entry
    Into Certain Covenants

KeyCorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and one
    transaction (with an overallotment option) in 2008, each of
    which involved the issuance of trust preferred securities
    (“Trust Preferred Securities”) by Delaware
    statutory trusts formed by KeyCorp (the “Trusts”), as
    further described below. Simultaneously with the closing of each
    of those transactions, KeyCorp entered into a replacement
    capital covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital
    Covenant” and collectively, the “Replacement Capital
    Covenants”) for the benefit of persons that buy or hold
    specified series of long-term indebtedness of KeyCorp or its
    then largest depository institution, currently KeyBank (the
    “Covered Debt”). Each of the Replacement Capital
    Covenants provide that neither KeyCorp nor any of its
    subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts) will redeem or
    purchase all or any part of the Trust Preferred Securities
    or certain junior subordinated debentures issued by KeyCorp and
    held by the Trust (the “Junior Subordinated
    Debentures”), as applicable, on or before the date
    specified in the applicable Replacement Capital Covenant, with
    certain limited exceptions, except to the extent that, during
    the 180 days prior to the date of that redemption or
    purchase, KeyCorp has received proceeds from the sale of
    qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the Trust Preferred
    Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, as applicable,
    at the time of redemption or purchase, and (ii) KeyCorp has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if
    such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.
    KeyCorp will provide a copy of the Replacement Capital Covenants
    to respective holders of Covered Debt upon request made in
    writing to KeyCorp, Investor Relations, 127 Public Square, Mail
    Code OH-01-27-1113, Cleveland, OH

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

An investment in our Common Shares is subject to risks inherent
    to our business, our industry and ownership of our equity
    securities. Described below are certain risks and uncertainties
    that management has identified as material. Before making an
    investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and
    uncertainties described below together with all of the other
    information included or incorporated by reference in this
    report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the
    only ones we face. Although we have significant risk management
    policies, procedures and verification processes in place,
    additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware
    of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial
    may also impair our business operations. This report is
    qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.

IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO
    LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY
    AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON KEY”). IF THIS
    WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON
    SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B PREFERRED
    STOCK AND OUR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES — COULD
    DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR
    PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.



Risks
    Related To Our Business

Disruptions
    in financial markets have affected and may continue to affect
    KeyCorp. Management’s actions may be unable to mitigate the
    extreme external factors presenting market risk.

The capital and credit markets, including the fixed income
    markets, have been experiencing extreme volatility and
    disruption since July 2007. During the third and fourth quarters
    of 2008, the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented
    levels. Uncertainties in these markets present significant
    challenges, particularly for the financial services industry. As
    a financial services company, our operations and financial
    condition are significantly affected by general economic and
    market conditions. For example, during 2008, the continued
    disruptions in the financial markets caused markdowns

and/or

losses by financial institutions from trading, hedging and other
    market activities. We were similarly affected. For example, we
    recorded an after-tax, noncash charge of $420 million
    during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to goodwill impairment
    resulting from a decline in the fair value of our National
    Banking unit, reflecting the extreme weakness in financial
    markets. In addition, during 2008, we increased our provision
    for loan losses in response to the deterioration in our loan
    portfolios resulting from the economic decline. In an effort to
    reduce the potential effects of any prolonged market disruption,
    management has implemented certain strategic decisions,
    including securing additional outside sources of funding for
    certain of our businesses, divesting

and/or

ceasing to conduct certain of our noncore businesses and closely
    managing growth and investment opportunities. It is difficult to
    predict how long these challenging economic conditions will
    exist, which of our markets, products or other businesses will
    ultimately be affected, and whether management’s actions
    will effectively mitigate these extreme external factors.
    Furthermore, the models that Key uses to assess the
    creditworthiness of customers and to estimate losses inherent in
    its credit exposure may become less predictive due to
    fundamental changes in the U.S. economy. Accordingly, these
    factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Key. Additional
    information regarding disruptions in financial markets is
    included in the sections captioned
    “Introduction — Economic Overview” and
    “Highlights of Key’s 2008 Performance —
    Financial performance” beginning on pages 18 and 23,
    respectively, of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2008 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).
    Additional information regarding certain strategic decisions
    management has implemented is included in the section captioned
    “Highlights of Key’s 2008 Performance —
    Strategic developments” on page 28 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Additional information regarding market risk is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Market risk
    management” beginning on page 54 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We are
    subject to interest rate risk.

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
    interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
    interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
    and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
    are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
    control, including general economic conditions, the competitive
    environment within our markets, consumer preferences for
    specific loan and deposit products and policies of various
    governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the
    Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including
    changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount
    of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
    interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
    could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
    deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
    liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
    borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
    receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
    and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
    could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
    loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest
    we pay on deposits and other borrowings. Management uses
    simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate
    exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance
    sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business
    volume, product pricing, the behavior of market interest rates
    and anticipated hedging activities. Simulation analysis involves
    a high degree of subjectivity and requires estimates of future
    risks and trends. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
    actual results will not differ from those derived in simulation
    analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
    rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed, changes in
    balance sheet composition, and the possible effects of
    unanticipated or unknown events.



Although management believes it has implemented effective asset
    and liability management strategies, including simulation
    analysis and the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to
    reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our
    results of operations, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in market interest rates could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Key. Additional information regarding interest
    rate risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Market risk management —
    Interest rate risk management” beginning on page 54 of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We are
    subject to other market risk.

Traditionally, market factors such as changes in foreign
    exchange rates, changes in the equity markets and changes in the
    financial soundness of bond insurers, sureties and even other
    unrelated financial companies have the potential to affect
    current market values of financial instruments. Recent market
    events have demonstrated this effect to an extreme. Since July
    2007, conditions in the fixed income markets, specifically the
    widening of credit spreads over benchmark U.S. Treasury
    securities for many fixed income securities, have caused
    significant volatility in the market values of loans,
    securities, and certain other financial instruments that are
    held in our trading or

held-for-sale

portfolios. Although management works to minimize the adverse
    affects when it is feasible to do so, those opportunities are
    not always available. It is possible that such volatility and
    adverse effects will continue over a prolonged period of time

and/or

worsen over time. As such, it is not possible for management to
    predict whether there will be further substantial changes in the
    financial markets that could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Key.

Additional information regarding market risk is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Market risk
    management — Trading portfolio risk management”
    on page 56 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2008 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Declining
    asset prices could adversely affect Key.

In recent months, the volatility and disruption that the capital
    and credit markets have experienced have reached extreme levels.
    The market dislocations have led to the failure of several
    substantial financial institutions, causing widespread
    liquidation of assets and further constraining credit markets.
    These asset sales, along with asset sales by other leveraged
    investors, including some hedge funds, have rapidly driven down
    prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset
    classes. Asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the
    valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our
    balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices
    we deem acceptable. This could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Key.

There
    can be no assurance that the EESA, the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009, and other initiatives undertaken by
    the United States government to restore liquidity and stability
    to the U.S. financial system will help stabilize the U.S.
    financial system.

The EESA was enacted in response to the ongoing financial crisis
    affecting the banking system and financial markets and going
    concern threats to investment banks and other financial
    institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has
    authority to, among other things, purchase up to
    $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities,
    preferred equity and warrants, and certain other financial
    instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of
    stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial
    markets. Under its authority provided by EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury established the Capital Purchase Program, and
    the core provisions of the Financial Stability Plan. There can
    be no assurance regarding the actual impact that the EESA or the
    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the
    “Recovery Bill”), or programs and other initiatives
    undertaken by the U.S. government will have on the
    financial markets; the extreme levels of volatility and limited
    credit availability currently being experienced may persist. The
    failure of the EESA or other government programs to help
    stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening
    of current financial market conditions could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Key. For additional information on programs
    and regulatory changes as a result of the EESA, including
    increase in deposit insurance limits and the TLGP and the
    Capital Purchase Program, see the sections captioned
    “Business — Supervision and Regulation” and
    “Federal Deposit Insurance Act” beginning on pages 3
    and 7, respectively, and the sections captioned
    “Introduction — Economic Overview —
    EESA and the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase
    Program” and “FDIC’s standard maximum deposit
    insurance limit increase and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program,” each of which begins on page 19 of the Financial
    Review Section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to



Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto). In the event that recent
    turmoil in the financial markets continues, we may experience a
    Material Adverse Effect on Key from (1) continued or
    accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets,
    (2) continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding
    financial institutions generally and our transaction
    counterparties specifically, (3) limitations resulting from
    further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional
    regulation of the financial system, or (4) recessionary
    conditions that are deeper or last longer than currently
    anticipated.

The
    soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect
    Key.

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be
    adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of
    other financial institutions. Financial services to institutions
    are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty
    or other relationships. Key has exposure to many different
    industries and counterparties, and routinely executes
    transactions with counterparties in the financial industry,
    including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment
    banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients.
    During 2008, Key incurred $54 million of derivative-related
    charges as a result of market disruption caused by the failure
    of Lehman Brothers. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions
    about, one or more financial services institutions, or the
    financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide
    liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or
    by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to
    credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or
    client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the
    collateral held by Key cannot be realized upon or is liquidated
    at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
    derivative exposure due us. While we maintain processes aimed at
    minimizing such exposures, it is not possible to anticipate all
    of these risks and it is not feasible to mitigate these risks
    completely. Accordingly, there is no assurance that losses from
    such risks would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

We are
    subject to credit risk.

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
    activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
    of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
    conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
    interest rates

and/or

further weakening of economic conditions could adversely impact
    the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value
    of the collateral securing these loans. We also are subject to
    various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities.
    Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could
    subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in
    the assessment against us of civil money or other penalties.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 72% of our loan
    portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
    loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
    mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
    types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate
    loans and consumer loans. We closely monitor and manage risk
    concentrations and utilize various portfolio management
    practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible
    to do so; however, our loan portfolio still contains a number of
    commercial loans with relatively large balances. The
    deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a
    significant increase in nonperforming loans, and an increase in
    nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from
    these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an
    increase in loan charge-offs, any of which could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Key. Additional information regarding credit
    risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Credit risk management” beginning on
    page 60 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2008
    Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We are
    subject to liquidity risk.

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
    level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences. Although management has
    implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse
    sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as
    unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both
    normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Key. Certain credit markets that we
    participate in and rely upon as sources of funding have been



significantly disrupted and highly volatile since the third
    quarter of 2007. These conditions increase our liquidity risk
    exposure. Part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves
    promoting customer deposit growth, exiting certain noncore
    lending businesses, utilizing the Federal Reserve’s Term
    Auction Facility, and the FDIC’s TLGP. If market disruption
    or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness

and/or

the
    availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged
    period of time, management may expand the utilization of secured
    wholesale funding instruments, such as the Federal
    Reserve’s Term Auction Facility and the issuance of
    FDIC-guaranteed debt under the FDIC’s TLGP; or use other
    potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such
    as generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans,
    extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, purchasing
    deposits from other banks, and utilizing relationships with
    fixed income investors in a variety of markets —
    domestic, European and Canadian — as well as increased
    management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other
    management tools. However, there can be no assurance that these
    alternative means of funding will remain available, and it is
    unclear what impact, given current economic conditions,
    unavailability of such funding would have on Key. For example,
    in 2007 and 2008, Key was unable to securitize its student loan
    portfolio at cost-effective rates. Accordingly, a deep and
    prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of
    significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective
    capital and funding, which could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Key. Additional information regarding liquidity risk is
    included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Liquidity risk management” beginning
    on page 56 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2008 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Various
    factors may cause our allowance for loan losses to
    increase.

We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve
    established through a provision for loan losses charged to
    expense, that represents management’s estimate of losses
    within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the
    judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated
    loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level
    of the allowance reflects management’s continuing
    evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks;
    loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present
    economic, political and regulatory conditions; and unexpected
    losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination
    of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses
    inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that
    we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future
    trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in
    economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information
    regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem
    loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control,
    may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In
    addition, bank regulatory agencies and our independent auditors
    periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may
    require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the
    recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that
    can differ somewhat from those of our own management. In
    addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance
    for loan losses (

i.e.

, if the loan allowance is
    inadequate), we will need additional loan loss provisions to
    increase the allowance for loan losses. Additional provisions to
    increase the allowance for loan losses, should they become
    necessary, would result in a decrease in net income and capital
    and may have a Material Adverse Effect on Key. Additional
    information regarding the allowance for loan losses is included
    in the section captioned “Risk Management —
    Credit risk management — Allowance for loan
    losses” beginning on page 61 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We are
    subject to operational risk.

We, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, which
    represents the risk of loss resulting from human error,
    inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
    external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
    (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or
    noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices or ethical standards. Although we seek to mitigate
    operational risk through a system of internal controls,
    resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of
    explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our
    reputation or foregone opportunities, any and all of which could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Key. Additional information
    regarding operational risk is included in the section captioned
    “Risk Management — Operational risk
    management” beginning on page 67 of the Financial
    Review section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).



Our
    profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in
    the geographic regions in which we operate.

Our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the
    markets in which we operate. Although we are somewhat
    geographically diversified, we still do have concentrations of
    loans and other business activities in geographic areas where
    our branches are principally located — the Northwest,
    the Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes and the Northeast. We also
    have potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our
    branch footprint. For example, the residential properties
    segment of our commercial real estate construction portfolio has
    been adversely affected by the downturn in the U.S. housing
    market because of deteriorating market conditions, principally
    in Florida and southern California, and the significant and
    steady increase in the level of nonperforming loans since the
    second half of 2007. As a result, management recently increased
    the provision for loan losses. The regional economic conditions
    in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the
    demand for our products and services as well as the ability of
    our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral
    securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources.
    A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by
    inflation, recession, an act of terrorism, outbreak of
    hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences,
    unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors,
    such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real
    estate, could also impact these regional economies and, in turn,
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Key. Additional information on
    the risks of the economic conditions of the geographic regions
    in which we operate is included in the section captioned
    “Introduction — Economic overview” beginning
    on page 18 and “Figure 1. Community Banking Geographic
    Diversity” beginning on page 20, which are part of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We
    operate in a highly competitive industry and market
    areas.

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
    from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
    larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
    primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
    smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
    operate. However, we also face competition from many other types
    of financial institutions, including, without limitation,
    savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies,
    finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
    management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
    other local, regional and national financial services firms. In
    recent years, while the breadth of the institutions that we
    compete with has increased, competition has intensified as a
    result of consolidation efforts. We expect this trend to
    continue. During 2008, competition intensified as the challenges
    of the liquidity crisis and market disruption led to
    redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to
    stronger and larger financial institutions. The competitive
    landscape was also affected by the conversion of traditional
    investment banks to bank holding companies during the current
    liquidity crisis due to the access it provides to
    government-sponsored sources of liquidity. The financial
    services industry could become even more competitive as a result
    of legislative, regulatory, structural and technological changes
    and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered
    barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer
    products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
    factors, including, among other things:

•

our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and
    initiatives;

•

our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term
    customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical
    standards and safe, sound assets;

•

our ability to expand our market position;

•

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services
    offered to meet customer needs and demands;

•

the rate at which we introduce new products and services
    relative to our competitors;

•

our ability to attract and retain talented executives and
    relationship managers; and

•

industry and general economic trends.



Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
    weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
    our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Key.

We are
    subject to extensive government regulation and
    supervision.

We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and
    supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to
    protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds
    and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These
    regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure,
    investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other
    things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually
    review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible
    changes. It is likely that there will be significant changes to
    the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime in
    light of the recent performance of and government intervention
    in the financial services industry. It is not possible to
    predict the impact of such changes on our results of operations.
    Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies; changes
    in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations
    or policies;

and/or

continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
    requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
    costs, limit the types of financial services and products that
    we may offer

and/or

increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial
    services and products, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with laws, regulations or policies
    (including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent
    such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
    agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Key. Additional information regarding supervision and regulation
    is included in the section captioned “Supervision and
    Regulation” in Item 1. Business, beginning on
    page 3 of this report.

Our
    controls and procedures may fail or be
    circumvented.

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls,
    disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance
    policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions
    and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that
    the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or
    circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to
    comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

We
    rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our
    funds.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its cash flow
    from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the
    principal source of funds to pay dividends on our Common Shares
    and interest and principal on our debt. Various laws and
    regulations limit the amount of dividends that KeyBank
    (KeyCorp’s largest subsidiary) and certain nonbank
    subsidiaries may pay to KeyCorp. During 2008, KeyBank did not
    pay any dividends to KeyCorp; nonbank subsidiaries paid KeyCorp
    $113,234 in dividends. As of the close of business on
    December 31, 2008, KeyBank would not have been permitted to
    pay dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval since
    the bank had a net loss of $1.161 billion for 2008.

Also, KeyCorp’s right to participate in a distribution of
    assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is
    subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.
    In the event KeyBank is unable to pay dividends to KeyCorp, we
    may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay
    dividends on our Common Shares. The inability to receive
    dividends from KeyBank could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Key. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is
    included in the section captioned “Supervision and
    Regulation — Dividend Restrictions” in
    Item 1. Business, beginning on page 4 of this report,
    and in Note 5 (“Restrictions on Cash, Dividends and
    Lending Activities”) and Note 14
    (“Shareholders’ Equity”) under the heading
    “Preferred Stock — Series B” on page 91 and
    beginning on page 102, respectively, of the Financial
    Review section of KeyCorp’s 2008 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Our
    earnings may be affected by changes in accounting principles and
    in tax laws.

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    could have a Material Adverse Effect on Key. Although these
    changes may not have an economic impact on our business, they
    could affect our ability to attain targeted levels for certain
    performance measures.



We, like all businesses, are subject to tax laws, rules and
    regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
    including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
    laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service or
    other governmental bodies, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
    costs, among other things. Failure to appropriately comply with
    tax laws, rules and regulations could result in sanctions by
    regulatory agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on
    Key. Additional information concerning our income tax risks is
    included in Note 17 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on
    page 110 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2008 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Potential
    acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder
    value.

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
    risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
    other things:

•

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the
    target company;

•

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;

•

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and
    personnel of the target company;

•

potential disruption to our business;

•

potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;

•

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target
    company;

•

difficulty in estimating the value (including goodwill) of the
    target company;

•

difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets,
    liabilities and derivatives of the target company; and

•

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may
    affect the target company.

We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
    conduct due diligence activities related to possible
    transactions with other financial institutions and financial
    services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
    discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
    future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
    securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve
    the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,
    therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
    income per common share may occur in connection with any future
    transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected
    revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or
    product presence,

and/or

other
    projected benefits from an acquisition could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Key.

We may
    not be able to attract and retain skilled people.

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
    and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
    activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may
    not be able to retain or hire the people we want

and/or

need.
    In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must
    compensate such employees at market levels. Typically, those
    levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest
    expense. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain
    qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our
    competitive position, our performance, including our competitive
    position, could suffer, and, in turn, cause a Material Adverse
    Effect on Key. Although we maintain employment agreements with
    certain key employees, and have incentive compensation plans
    aimed, in part, at long-term employee retention, the unexpected
    loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could still
    occur, and such events may have a Material Adverse Effect on Key
    because of the loss of the employee’s skills, knowledge of
    our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of
    promptly finding qualified replacement personnel for our
    talented executives

and/or

relationship managers.

Pursuant to the standardized terms of the Capital Purchase
    Program, among other things, we agreed to institute certain
    restrictions on the compensation of certain senior executive
    management positions that could have an adverse effect on our
    ability to hire or retain the most qualified senior executives.
    Other restrictions may also be imposed under the Recovery Bill
    or other legislation or regulations. Key’s ability to
    attract

and/or

retain talented



executives

and/or

relationship managers may be affected by these developments or
    any new executive compensation limits, and such restrictions
    could result in a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

Our
    information systems may experience an interruption or breach in
    security.

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
    conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in
    security of these systems could result in failures or
    disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
    ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies
    and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
    possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
    information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
    failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if
    they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The
    occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of
    our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a
    loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory
    scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible
    financial liability, any of which could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Key.

We
    continually encounter technological change.

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
    technological change with frequent introductions of new
    technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
    technology increases efficiency and enables financial
    institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our
    future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
    needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
    and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
    create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
    competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
    technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
    implement new technology-driven products and services or be
    successful in marketing these products and services to our
    customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological
    change affecting the financial services industry could have a
    Material Adverse Effect on Key.

We are
    subject to claims and litigation.

From time to time, customers

and/or

vendors may make claims and take legal action against us. We
    maintain reserves for certain claims when management deems it is
    appropriate to do so upon its assessment of the claims. Whether
    any particular claims and legal actions are founded or
    unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in
    our favor they may result in significant financial liability

and/or

adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products
    and services as well as impact customer demand for those
    products and services. We are also involved, from time to time,
    in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal
    and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies
    regarding our business, including, among other things,
    accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result
    in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions
    or other relief. The number of these investigations and
    proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many
    firms in the financial services industry. There have also been a
    number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct
    by employees in the financial services industry in recent years,
    and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is
    not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and
    the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may
    not be effective in all cases. Any financial liability for which
    we have not adequately maintained reserves,

and/or

any
    reputation damage from such claims and legal actions, could have
    a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

Severe
    weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other
    external events could significantly impact our
    business.

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
    other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
    our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
    stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
    to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
    securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
    loss of revenue

and/or

cause
    us to incur additional expenses. Although management has
    established disaster recovery plans and procedures, the
    occurrence of any such event could have a Material Adverse
    Effect on Key.



Risks
    Associated With Our Common Shares

Our
    issuance of securities to the U.S. Treasury may limit Key’s
    ability to return capital to its shareholders and is dilutive to
    our Common Shares. If we are unable to redeem such preferred
    shares, the dividend rate increases substantially after five
    years.

In connection with our sale of $2.5 billion of the
    Series B Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury in
    conjunction with its Capital Purchase Program, we also issued a
    Warrant to purchase 35,244,361 of our Common Shares at an
    exercise price of $10.64. The number of shares was determined
    based upon the requirements of the Capital Purchase Program, and
    was calculated based on the average market price of our Common
    Shares for the 20 trading days preceding approval of our
    issuance (which was also the basis for the exercise price of
    $10.64). The terms of the transaction with the
    U.S. Treasury include limitations on our ability to pay
    dividends and repurchase our Common Shares. For three years
    after the issuance or until the U.S. Treasury no longer
    holds any Series B Preferred Stock, we will not be able to
    increase our dividends above the level of our quarterly dividend
    declared during the third quarter of 2008 ($0.1875 per common
    share on a quarterly basis) nor repurchase any of our Common
    Shares or preferred stock without, among other things,
    U.S. Treasury approval or the availability of certain
    limited exceptions

, e.g

., purchases in connection with
    our benefit plans. Furthermore, as long as the Series B
    Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is outstanding,
    dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to
    certain equity securities, including our Common Shares, are
    prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on
    such preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions.
    These restrictions combined with the dilutive impact of the
    Warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of our
    Common Shares, and, as a result, they could have a Material
    Adverse Effect on Key.

Unless we are able to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock
    during the first five years, the dividend payments on this
    capital will increase substantially at that point, from 5%
    ($125 million annually) to 9% ($225 million annually).
    Depending on market conditions at the time, this increase in
    dividends could significantly impact our liquidity, and as a
    result, have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

KeyCorp
    is required to conduct stress tests pursuant to the U.S.
    Treasury’s Capital Assistance Program, and could be
    required to raise additional capital that would be dilutive to
    our Common Shares and may limit our ability to return capital to
    our shareholders.

On February 25, 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced
    preliminary details of the Capital Assistance Program (the
    “CAP”) component of its Financial Stability Plan. The
    CAP is intended to ensure the continued ability of
    U.S. financial institutions to lend to creditworthy
    borrowers in the event of a weaker than expected economic
    environment and larger than expected potential losses. There are
    two components of CAP: (1) a supervisory exercise that
    involves a forward-looking capital assessment (the “Stress
    Test”) to determine whether any of the major
    U.S. banking organizations, including Key, need to raise
    additional capital, and (2) access to qualifying financial
    institutions to mandatory convertible preferred equity intended
    to serve as a bridge to private capital in the future.

Participation in CAP is mandatory for all bank holding companies
    with assets in excess of $100 billion, like KeyCorp. Under
    the CAP, institutions are required to conduct a Stress Test
    under assumptions provided by the U.S. government.
    Following the Stress Test, should the U.S. Treasury and
    Key’s banking regulators determine that additional capital
    is necessary Key will have a six month window to raise that
    capital privately or to access the capital made available by the
    U.S. Treasury under the CAP. Should Key need to issue
    additional equity capital, it would be dilutive to our Common
    Shares and may limit our ability to return capital to our
    shareholders. These factors may have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Key.

To view the CAP term sheet, including a summary of the terms of
    the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the warrant to
    purchase common shares that the U.S. Treasury receives in
    connection with any CAP issuance see www.financialstability.gov.



Our
    share price can be volatile.

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
    resell your Common Shares when you want and at prices you find
    attractive. Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
    response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

•

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
    operations;

•

recommendations by securities analysts;

•

operating and stock price performance of other companies that
    investors deem comparable to our business;

•

news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
    the financial services industry;

•

perceptions of us

and/or

our
    competitors in the marketplace;

•

new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;

•

significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic
    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments entered into
    by us or our competitors;

•

failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated
    benefits from acquisitions;

•

changes in governmental regulations;

•

geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or
    military conflicts; and

•

the occurrence or nonoccurrence, as appropriate, of any
    circumstance described in these Risk Factors.

General market fluctuations, market disruption, industry factors
    and general economic and political conditions and events, such
    as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or
    credit loss trends, could also cause our share price to decrease
    regardless of operating results.

An
    investment in our Common Shares is not an insured
    deposit.

Our Common Shares are not a bank deposit and, therefore, are not
    insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
    fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our
    Common Shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in
    this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
    report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
    price of Common Shares in any company. As a result, if you
    acquire our Common Shares, you may lose some or all of your
    investment.

Our
    articles of incorporation and regulations as well as certain
    banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations,
    federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
    requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial
    to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may
    inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination,
    which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our
    common shares.

Risks
    Associated With Our Industry

Difficult
    market conditions have adversely affected the financial services
    industry, business and results of operations.

Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past eighteen
    months, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures,
    unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the
    credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant
    write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including
    government-sponsored entities, and commercial and investment
    banks. The resulting write-downs to assets of financial
    institutions have caused many financial institutions to seek
    additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger
    institutions and, in some cases, to seek government assistance
    or bankruptcy protection. It is not possible to predict how long
    these economic conditions will exist, which of our markets,
    products or other businesses will ultimately be



affected, and whether management’s actions and government
    remediation efforts will effectively mitigate these factors.
    Accordingly, the resulting lack of available credit, lack of
    confidence in the financial sector, decreased consumer
    confidence, increased volatility in the financial markets and
    reduced business activity could have a Material Adverse Effect
    on Key. Furthermore, the continued deterioration in economic
    conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and
    nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a
    decrease in demand for our products and services, among other
    things, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

As a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions,
    Key may face the following risks, including, but not limited to:

•

Increased regulation of our industry, including heightened legal
    standards and regulatory requirements or expectations imposed in
    connection with the EESA, the Recovery Bill or other government
    initiatives. Compliance with such regulation will likely
    increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business
    opportunities.

•

Impairment of our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our
    customers if the models and approaches we use to select, manage,
    and underwrite customers become less predictive of future
    behaviors due to fundamental changes in economic conditions.

•

The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit
    exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments,
    including forecasts of economic conditions and how these
    economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers
    to repay their loans. Such process may no longer be capable of
    accurate estimation and, in turn, may impact the reliability of
    our evaluation of our credit risk and exposure.

•

Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to
    engage in securitization funding transactions on favorable terms
    or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in
    the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating
    agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.

•

Increased intensity of competition in the financial services
    industry due to: (i) the recent mergers of certain
    financial institutions with stronger and larger financial
    institutions and the redistribution of FDIC-insured deposits and
    certain banking assets through the FDIC least-cost resolution
    process, and (ii) the conversion of certain investment
    banks to bank holding companies. We expect competition to
    intensify as a result of these changes to the competitive
    landscape. Should competition in the financial services industry
    continue to intensify, our ability to market products and
    services may be adversely affected.

•

We will be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in
    the future because market developments have significantly
    depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of
    reserves to insured deposits. Key is also likely to be required
    to pay other fees necessary to support the EESA, the Recovery
    Bill and other government efforts.

•

Key’s ability to attract talented executives

and/or

relationship managers may be hindered as a result of executive
    compensation limits under the Capital Purchase Program

and/or

regulations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury or
    other regulators pursuant to its authority under the EESA or the
    Recovery Bill. Furthermore, Key may lose talented executives and
    relationship managers as a result of such limitations.

Financial
    services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of
    information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
    transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
    behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
    statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
    may also rely on representations of those customers,
    counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
    auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
    information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
    statements, credit reports or other financial information could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.



Consumers
    may decide not to use banks to complete their financial
    transactions.

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
    through alternative methods financial transactions that
    historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
    maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would
    have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also
    complete transactions such as paying bills

and/or

transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The
    process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
    “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
    income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
    income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
    streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
    have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act), to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to
    KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that
    evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of
    these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all
    material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this
    report. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as defined in
