ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio,
    is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. It has elected to be a bank
    holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank
    Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”).
    KeyCorp is one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial
    services companies, with consolidated total assets of
    $100.0 billion at December 31, 2007. KeyCorp is the
    parent holding company for KeyBank National Association
    (“KeyBank”), its principal subsidiary, through which
    most of its banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and
    certain other subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides a wide range of
    retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment
    management, consumer finance and investment banking products and
    services to individual, corporate and institutional clients
    through two major business groups: Community Banking and
    National Banking. As of December 31, 2007, these services
    were provided across much of the country through KeyBank’s
    955 full-service retail banking branches (“branches”)
    in thirteen states, a telephone banking call center services
    group and 1,443 automated teller machines (“ATMs”) in
    fifteen states. Following KeyBank’s acquisition of U.S.B.
    Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, in
    January 2008, KeyBank’s branches total 985 in fourteen
    states with 1,481 ATMs in sixteen states. Additional information
    pertaining to KeyCorp’s two business groups is included in
    the “Line of Business Results” section beginning on
    page 23 and in Note 4 (“Line of Business
    Results”) beginning on page 75 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto) and is incorporated herein by
    reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries had an average of
    18,934 full-time equivalent employees during 2007.

In addition to the customary banking services of accepting
    deposits and making loans, KeyCorp’s bank and trust company
    subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services,
    personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash
    management services, investment banking and capital markets
    products, and international banking services. Through its
    subsidiary bank, trust company and registered investment adviser
    subsidiaries, KeyCorp provides investment management services to
    clients that include large corporate and public retirement
    plans, foundations and endowments, high net worth individuals
    and multiemployer trust funds established for providing pension,
    vacation or other benefits to employees.

KeyCorp provides other financial services — both
    inside and outside of its primary banking markets —
    through nonbank subsidiaries. These services include accident,
    health, and credit-life insurance on loans made by KeyBank,
    principal investing, community development financing, securities
    underwriting and brokerage, and merchant services. KeyCorp is an
    equity participant in a joint venture that provides merchant
    services to businesses.

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank
    and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its
    security holders and its creditors to participate in any
    distribution of the assets or earnings of KeyCorp’s bank
    and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the
    respective creditors of such bank and other subsidiaries, except
    to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as
    creditor of such bank and other subsidiaries may be recognized.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

The information presented in Note 3 (“Acquisitions and
    Divestitures”) on page 74 of the Financial Review section
    of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto) is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

The market for banking and related financial services is highly
    competitive. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries (“Key”)
    compete with other providers of financial services, such as bank
    holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations,
    credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies,
    mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms,
    investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local,
    regional and national institutions that offer financial
    services. Key competes by offering quality products and
    innovative services at competitive prices.

In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater
    concentration in the banking industry and placed added
    competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and
    services. In addition, competition has intensified as a
    consequence of the financial modernization laws that were
    enacted in November 1999 to permit qualifying financial
    institutions to expand into other activities. For example,
    commercial banks are permitted to have affiliates that
    underwrite and deal in securities, underwrite insurance and make
    merchant banking investments under certain conditions. See
    “Financial Modernization Legislation” on page 7 of
    this report.

Supervision
    and Regulation

The following discussion addresses certain material elements of
    the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies
    and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information
    regarding Key. The regulatory framework is intended primarily to
    protect customers and depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund
    (the “DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the banking system as a
    whole, and generally is not intended to protect security holders.

Set forth below is a brief discussion of selected laws,
    regulations and regulatory agency policies applicable to Key.
    This discussion is not intended to be comprehensive and is
    qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
    statutes, regulations and regulatory agency policies to which
    the discussion refers. Changes in applicable laws,



regulations and regulatory agency policies cannot necessarily be
    predicted by management, yet such changes may have a material
    effect on Key’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations.

General

As a bank holding company, KeyCorp is subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”)
    under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies may not,
    in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or
    control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially
    all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of
    the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies
    are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or
    industrial activities. KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries are also
    subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by
    applicable federal banking agencies. KeyCorp operates one
    full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank,
    and one national bank subsidiary whose activities are limited to
    those of a fiduciary. Both of KeyCorp’s national bank
    subsidiaries, and their subsidiaries, are subject to regulation,
    supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of
    the Currency (the “OCC”). The FDIC also has certain
    regulatory and supervisory authority over KeyBank, because the
    domestic deposits in KeyBank are insured (up to applicable
    limits) by the FDIC.

KeyCorp also has other financial services subsidiaries that are
    subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
    Federal Reserve Board, as well as other applicable state and
    federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations.
    For example, KeyCorp’s branch-based and institutional
    brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to
    supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”), the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority

and/or

state
    securities regulators, and KeyCorp’s insurance subsidiaries
    are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
    authorities of the various states. Other nonbank subsidiaries of
    KeyCorp are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal
    government and the various states in which they are authorized
    to do business.

Dividend
    Restrictions

The principal source of cash flow to KeyCorp, including cash
    flow to pay dividends on its common shares and interest on its
    indebtedness, is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various
    statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of
    dividends that may be paid by KeyCorp’s bank subsidiaries
    without regulatory approval. The approval of the OCC is required
    for the payment of any dividend by a national bank if the total
    of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank
    in any calendar year would exceed the total of: (i) the
    bank’s net income for the current year plus (ii) the
    retained net income (as defined and interpreted by regulation)
    for the preceding two years, less any required transfer to
    surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In
    addition, a national bank can pay dividends only to the extent
    of its undivided profits. KeyCorp’s national bank
    subsidiaries are subject to these restrictions.

If, in the opinion of a federal banking agency, a depository
    institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to
    engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
    financial condition of the institution, could include the
    payment of dividends), the agency may require that such
    institution cease and desist from such practice. The OCC and the
    FDIC have indicated that paying dividends that would deplete a
    depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate
    level would be an unsafe and unsound practice. Moreover, under
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), an
    insured depository institution may not pay any dividend
    (i) if payment would cause it to become less than
    “adequately capitalized,” or (ii) while it is in
    default in the payment of an assessment due to the FDIC. See
    “Regulatory Capital Standards and Related
    Matters — Prompt Corrective Action” on page 6 of
    this report. Also, the federal banking agencies have issued
    policy statements that provide that FDIC-insured depository
    institutions and their holding companies should generally pay
    dividends only out of their current operating earnings.

Holding
    Company Structure

Bank Transactions With Affiliates.

Federal
    banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and
    quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank
    with its affiliates. Transactions covered by these provisions,
    which include bank loans and other extensions of credit to
    affiliates, bank purchases of assets from



affiliates, and bank sales of assets to affiliates, must be on
    arm’s length terms, cannot exceed certain amounts that are
    determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital,
    and if a loan or other extension of credit, must be secured by
    collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by
    statute. For these purposes, a bank includes certain of its
    subsidiaries and other companies it is deemed to control, while
    an affiliate includes the bank’s parent bank holding
    company, certain of its nonbank subsidiaries and other companies
    it is deemed to control, and certain other companies. As a
    result, these provisions materially restrict the ability of
    KeyBank, as a bank, to fund its affiliates including KeyCorp,
    KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds,
    any of the Austin Capital funds and KeyCorp’s nonbanking
    subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments.

Source of Strength Doctrine.

Under Federal
    Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to
    serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each
    of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to
    commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This
    support may be required at a time when KeyCorp may not have the
    resources to, or would choose not to, provide it. Certain loans
    by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate
    in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other
    indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law
    provides that in the event of its bankruptcy, any commitment by
    a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to
    maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
    bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Depositor Preference.

The FDIA provides that,
    in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution”
    of an insured depository institution, the claims of its
    depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured
    depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of
    the FDIC as a receiver would be afforded a priority over other
    general unsecured claims against such an institution, including
    federal funds and letters of credit. If an insured depository
    institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with
    the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit
    creditors, including a parent holding company, in order of
    priority of payment.

Liability of Commonly Controlled
    Institutions.

Under the FDIA, an insured
    depository institution that is under common control with another
    insured depository institution is generally liable for any loss
    incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC
    in connection with the default of the commonly controlled
    institution, or any assistance provided by the FDIC to the
    commonly controlled institution that is in danger of default.
    The term “default” is defined generally to mean the
    appointment of a conservator or receiver and the term “in
    danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of
    certain conditions indicating that a “default” is
    likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Commercial Real Estate Lending
    Concentrations.

The banking agencies jointly
    issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for
    institutions having concentrations in commercial real estate
    (“CRE”) loans. Institutions actively involved in CRE
    lending should perform ongoing risk assessments to identify CRE
    concentrations. Institutions having such concentrations should
    have risk management practices that are commensurate with the
    level and nature of their concentration risk. Key elements in
    establishing a risk management framework that effectively
    identifies, monitors, and controls CRE concentration risk
    include board and management oversight, portfolio management,
    management information systems, market analysis, credit
    underwriting standards, portfolio stress testing and sensitivity
    analysis, and credit risk review. Institutions having such
    concentrations also should have regulatory capital that is
    commensurate with the level and nature of their concentration
    risk. In assessing capital adequacy, the agencies will consider
    the level and nature of inherent risk in the CRE portfolio as
    well as management expertise, historical performance,
    underwriting standards, risk management practices, market
    conditions, and any loan loss reserves allocated for CRE
    concentration risk. Institutions potentially exposed to
    significant CRE concentration risk may be identified for further
    supervisory analysis of the level and nature of CRE
    concentration risk. Such institutions include those that have
    experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, have notable exposure
    to a specific type of CRE, or are approaching or have exceeded
    specific quantitative supervisory criteria.

Elevated Risk Complex Structured Finance
    Transactions.

The banking agencies and the SEC
    published an interagency statement on sound practices concerning
    elevated risk complex structured finance transactions
    (“CSFTs”). The statement describes the types of risk
    management principles the banking agencies and the SEC believe
    may help a financial institution identify CSFTs that may pose
    heightened levels of legal or reputational risk to the
    institution as well as evaluate, manage and address such risks
    within the institution’s internal control framework. The
    statement focuses on the maintenance of policies and procedures
    designed to allow the institution



to identify, evaluate, assess, document, and control the full
    range of market, credit, operational, legal, and reputational
    risks associated with elevated risk CSFTs. The statement also
    provides illustrative examples of both structured finance
    transactions that are not considered to be elevated risk CSFTs
    as well as structured finance transactions that may be elevated
    risk CSFTs.

Regulatory
    Capital Standards and Related Matters

Risk-Based and Leverage Regulatory
    Capital.

Federal laws and regulations define and
    prescribe minimum levels of regulatory capital for bank holding
    companies and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy of regulatory
    capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies
    in the examination and supervision process, and in the
    evaluation of applications in connection with specific
    transactions and activities, including acquisitions, expansion
    of existing activities, and commencement of new activities.

Bank holding companies are subject to risk-based capital
    guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. These
    guidelines establish minimum ratios of qualifying capital to
    risk-weighted assets. Qualifying capital includes Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital. Risk-weighted assets are
    calculated by assigning varying risk-weights to broad categories
    of assets and off-balance-sheet exposures, based primarily on
    counterparty credit risk. The required minimum Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio, calculated by dividing Tier 1
    capital by risk-weighted assets, is currently 4.00%. The
    required minimum total risk-based capital ratio is currently
    8.00%. It is calculated by dividing the sum of Tier 1
    capital and Tier 2 capital (which cannot exceed the amount
    of Tier 1 capital), after deducting for investments in
    certain subsidiaries and associated companies and for reciprocal
    holdings of capital instruments, by risk-weighted assets.

Tier 1 capital includes common equity, qualifying perpetual
    preferred equity, and minority interests in the equity accounts
    of consolidated subsidiaries less certain intangible assets
    (including goodwill) and certain other assets. Tier 2
    capital includes qualifying hybrid capital instruments,
    perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, perpetual
    preferred equity not includable in Tier 1 capital, and
    limited amounts of term subordinated debt, medium-term preferred
    equity, certain unrealized holding gains on certain equity
    securities, and the allowance for loan and lease losses.

Bank holding companies, such as KeyCorp, whose securities and
    commodities trading activities exceed specified levels also are
    required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk
    includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign
    exchange, and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad
    market movements (such as changes in the general level of
    interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, or
    commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as
    idiosyncratic variation, event risk, and default risk). The
    banking agencies have developed and published for comment a
    proposed rule that would modify the existing market risk capital
    requirements. The proposed rule would enhance modeling
    requirements consistent with advances in risk management,
    enhance sensitivity to risks not adequately captured in the
    current methodologies of the existing requirements, and modify
    the definition of covered position to better capture positions
    for which the market risk capital requirements are appropriate.
    It would also impose an explicit capital requirement for
    incremental default risk to capture default risk over a time
    horizon of one year taking into account the impact of liquidity,
    concentrations, hedging, and optionality. At December 31,
    2007, Key’s Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted
    assets ratios were 7.44% and 11.38%, respectively, which include
    required adjustments for market risk.

In addition to the risk-based standard, bank holding companies
    are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s leverage ratio
    guidelines. These guidelines establish minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 capital to total assets. The minimum leverage ratio,
    calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average total
    consolidated assets, is 3.00% for bank holding companies that
    either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented
    the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based capital measure for
    market risk. All other bank holding companies must maintain a
    minimum leverage ratio of at least 4.00%. Neither KeyCorp nor
    any of its bank subsidiaries has been advised by its primary
    federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio
    applicable to it. At December 31, 2007, Key’s
    Tier 1 capital leverage ratio was 8.39%.

KeyCorp’s national bank subsidiaries are also subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted by the OCC,
    which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal
    Reserve Board on bank holding



companies. At December 31, 2007, each of KeyCorp’s
    national bank subsidiaries had regulatory capital in excess of
    all minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements.

In addition to establishing regulatory minimum ratios of capital
    to assets for all bank holding companies and their bank
    subsidiaries, the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    also identify various organization-specific factors and risks
    that are not taken into account in the computation of the
    capital ratios but that affect the overall supervisory
    evaluation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital
    adequacy and can result in the imposition of higher minimum
    regulatory capital ratio requirements upon the particular
    organization. Neither the Federal Reserve Board nor the OCC has
    advised KeyCorp or any of its national bank subsidiaries of any
    specific minimum risk-based or leverage capital ratio applicable
    to KeyCorp or such national bank subsidiary. Additional
    information regarding regulatory capital levels is included in
    the “Capital” section beginning on page 42 of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Recourse Obligations, Direct Credit Substitutes, and Residual
    Interests.

Specialized regulatory capital
    treatment is prescribed for on-balance sheet assets and
    off-balance sheet exposures consisting of recourse obligations,
    direct credit substitutes, and residual interests that expose
    banking organizations primarily to credit risk. This treatment
    includes a concentration limit Tier 1 capital charge and a
    dollar-for-dollar capital charge for certain types of residual
    interests and the use of credit rating and certain alternative
    approaches to match regulatory capital requirements more closely
    to a banking organization’s relative risk of loss for
    certain positions in asset securitizations.

Equity Investments in Nonfinancial
    Companies.

Specialized regulatory capital
    treatment is prescribed for certain equity investments made by
    banking organizations in companies engaged in nonfinancial
    activities. This treatment imposes marginal capital charges
    (applied by making deductions from Tier 1 capital) that
    increase as the banking organization’s aggregate carrying
    amount of its covered equity investments increase in relation to
    its Tier 1 capital. Such capital charges range from 8% to
    25% as such aggregate carrying amount increases from 15% to 25%
    of the banking organization’s Tier 1 capital.

Prompt Corrective Action.

The “prompt
    corrective action” provisions of the FDIA create a
    statutory framework that applies a system of both discretionary
    and mandatory supervisory actions indexed to the capital level
    of FDIC-insured depository institutions. These provisions impose
    progressively more restrictive constraints on operations,
    management, and capital distributions of an institution as its
    regulatory capital decreases, or in some cases, based on
    supervisory information other than the institution’s
    capital level. This framework and the authority the FDIA confers
    on the federal banking agencies supplements other existing
    authority vested in such agencies to initiate supervisory
    actions to address capital deficiencies. Moreover, other
    provisions of law and regulation employ regulatory capital level
    designations the same as or similar to those established by the
    prompt corrective action provisions both in imposing certain
    restrictions and limitations and in conferring certain economic
    and other benefits upon institutions. These include restrictions
    on brokered deposits, FDIC deposit insurance limits on
    pass-through deposits, limits on exposure to interbank
    liabilities, risk-based FDIC deposit insurance premium
    assessments, and expedited action upon regulatory applications.

FDIC-insured depository institutions are grouped into one of
    five prompt corrective action capital categories —
    well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized,
    significantly undercapitalized and critically
    undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based,
    total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the
    relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well
    capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at
    least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least
    6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00%
    and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital
    directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution must have
    a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00%, a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.00% and a
    Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.00% (3.00% if
    it has achieved the highest composite rating in its most recent
    examination). At December 31, 2007, KeyBank, KeyCorp’s
    only FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiary, met the
    requirements for the “well capitalized” capital
    category. An institution’s prompt corrective action capital
    category, however, may not constitute an accurate representation
    of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or
    its bank subsidiaries, and should be considered in conjunction
    with other available information regarding Key’s financial
    condition and results of operations.

Basel Accords.

The current minimum risk-based
    capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking
    agencies are based on a 1988 international accord that was
    developed by the international Basel Committee on



Banking Supervision. In 2004, the Basel Committee published its
    new capital framework document (“Basel II”) governing
    the capital adequacy of large, internationally active banking
    organizations that generally rely on sophisticated risk
    management and measurement systems. Basel II is designed to
    create incentives for these organizations to improve their risk
    measurement and management processes and to better align minimum
    capital requirements with the risks underlying activities
    conducted by these organizations.

Basel II adopts a three-pillar framework for addressing
    capital adequacy — minimum capital requirements,
    supervisory review, and market discipline. The minimum capital
    requirement pillar includes capital charges for credit,
    operational, and market risk exposures of a banking
    organization. The supervisory review pillar addresses the need
    for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy
    position relative to its overall risk, rather than only with
    respect to its minimum capital requirement, as well as the need
    for a banking organization supervisory authority to review and
    respond to the banking organization’s capital adequacy
    assessment. The market discipline pillar imposes public
    disclosure requirements on a banking organization that are
    intended to allow market participants to assess key information
    about the organization’s risk profile and its associated
    level of capital.

In December 2007, the agencies issued and published a final rule
    for implementing Basel II in the U.S. While the final
    rule is effective April 1, 2008, implementation is subject
    to a multi-year transition period in which limits are imposed
    upon the amount by which minimum required capital may decrease.
    It does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective
    action and leverage capital requirements, and explicitly
    reserves the agencies’ authority to require organizations
    to hold additional capital where appropriate. Application of the
    final rule to U.S. banking organizations is mandatory for
    some and optional for others. Currently, neither Key nor KeyBank
    is required to apply the final rule.

FDIC
    Deposit Insurance

Because substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits
    are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, KeyBank is
    subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC.
    Comprehensive deposit insurance reform legislation was enacted
    in 2006. Pursuant to this legislation, the former Bank Insurance
    Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund were merged into the
    DIF, deposit insurance for certain retirement accounts has
    increased from $100,000 to $250,000, and deposit insurance
    limits for accounts are subject to an indexing mechanism for
    future increases in coverage limits. The legislation also
    requires the FDIC to maintain the DIF reserve ratio within a
    range of 1.15%-1.50% of estimated insured deposits, with a DIF
    restoration plan being required upon the FDIC’s
    determination that the DIF reserve ratio has fallen or will
    within six months fall below 1.15% of estimated insured
    deposits. Other changes made by this legislation have permitted
    the FDIC to change its previous risk-related deposit insurance
    assessment framework. Under the new assessment framework, in
    2007, assessed financial institutions’ premiums ranged from
    $.05 to $.43 in 2007 (compared with zero to $.27 throughout
    2006) for each $100 of domestic deposits assessed based
    upon an institution’s capitalization, financial ratios (or,
    for certain large institutions, long-term debt issuer ratings),
    and federal supervisory evaluation. This new legislation and the
    FDIC’s new assessment framework implementing it also
    authorizes certain one-time premium assessment credits and,
    under certain circumstances, requires certain dividends from the
    DIF. During 2007, KeyBank received a one-time premium assessment
    credit of $59.4 million. KeyBank used $23.7 million of
    such premium assessment credit during 2007 towards its deposit
    insurance premiums.

Financial
    Modernization Legislation

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”)
    authorized new activities for qualifying financial institutions.
    The GLBA repealed significant provisions of the Glass-Steagall
    Act to permit commercial banks to, among other things, have
    affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities and make
    merchant banking investments. The GLBA modified the BHCA to
    permit bank holding companies that meet certain specified
    standards (known as “financial holding companies”) to
    engage in a broader range of financial activities than
    previously permitted under the BHCA, and allowed subsidiaries of
    commercial banks that meet certain specified standards (known as
    “financial subsidiaries”) to engage in a wide range of
    financial activities that are prohibited to such banks
    themselves. In 2000, KeyCorp elected to become a financial
    holding company. Under the authority conferred by the GLBA, Key
    has been able to expand the nature and scope of its equity
    investments in nonfinancial companies, and acquire financial
    subsidiaries to engage in real estate leasing and insurance
    agency activities without geographic restriction.



The GLBA also established new privacy protections for customers
    of financial institutions. Under federal law, a financial
    institution must provide notice to customers about its privacy
    policies and practices, describe the conditions under which the
    financial institution may disclose nonpublic personal
    information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties, and
    provide an “opt-out” method for consumers to prevent
    the financial institution from disclosing that information to
    non-affiliated third parties.

The GLBA repealed the blanket exception for banks and savings
    associations from the definitions of “broker” and
    “dealer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    (the “Exchange Act”), and replaced this full exception
    with functional exceptions. Under the statute, institutions that
    engage in securities activities either must conduct those
    activities through a registered broker-dealer or conform their
    securities activities to those which qualify for functional
    exceptions. The requirements relating to dealer registration
    have become effective. The final requirements relating to broker
    registration were published on September 19, 2007, but
    their effective date has been delayed until January 1,
    2009. KeyCorp is reviewing the impact of these rules on its bank
    subsidiaries’ operations and expects to be in full
    compliance with these rules by the effective date.

USA
    PATRIOT Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate
    Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) and the federal regulations
    issued pursuant to it substantially broaden previously existing
    anti-money laundering law and regulation, increase compliance,
    due diligence and reporting obligations for financial
    institutions, create new crimes and penalties, and require the
    federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and other
    acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the
    parties in combating money laundering activities.

In June 2007, the OCC removed the October 2005 consent order
    concerning KeyBank’s Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and
    anti-money laundering compliance. At that same time, the Federal
    Reserve Bank of Cleveland terminated its memorandum of
    understanding with KeyCorp concerning BSA and other related
    matters.

Management endeavors to assure that all related regulatory
    requirements are met.

Fair and
    Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the
    “FACT Act”) imposes new requirements on financial
    institutions regarding identity theft and reporting to credit
    bureaus. The FACT Act also allows customers to choose to opt out
    of having certain information shared across a financial
    institution’s affiliates for market solicitation purposes.
    Final regulations were issued in 2007 concerning the details of
    this solicitation opt-out. Key believes that the changes already
    implemented will satisfy the material requirements of the
    solicitation opt-out and the new regulations promulgated under
    the FACT Act implementing it.

In addition, on October 31, 2007, the federal financial
    regulatory agencies together issued final regulations (the
    “Red Flag Guidelines”) implementing Sections 114
    and 315 of the FACT Act. The Red Flag Guidelines require Key to
    develop and implement an identity theft protection program for
    new and existing customer accounts and other accounts for which
    there is a reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft. The
    identity theft program must be in place no later than
    November 1, 2008. Compliance with the Red Flag Guidelines
    requires Key to have a formal program in place that identifies
    threats, assesses risk, prioritizes gaps, remediates high risk
    gaps and provides board level reporting. Key believes that it
    will be able to implement an identity theft program and achieve
    regulatory requirements within the time frames provided.

Entry
    Into Certain Covenants

KeyCorp entered into two transactions during 2006 and a third
    transaction on February 27, 2008, each of which involved
    the issuance of trust preferred securities
    (“Trust Preferred Securities”) by Delaware
    statutory trusts formed by KeyCorp (the “Trusts”), as
    further described below. Simultaneously with the closing of each
    of those transactions, KeyCorp entered into a replacement
    capital covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital
    Covenant” and collectively, the “Replacement Capital
    Covenants”) for the benefit of persons that buy or hold
    specified series of long-term indebtedness of KeyCorp or its
    then largest depository institution, currently KeyBank (the
    “Covered



Debt”). Each of the Replacement Capital Covenants provide
    that neither KeyCorp nor any of its subsidiaries (including any
    of the Trusts) will redeem or purchase all or any part of the
    Trust Preferred Securities or certain junior subordinated
    debentures issued by KeyCorp and held by the Trust (the
    “Junior Subordinated Debentures”), as applicable, on
    or before the date specified in the applicable Replacement
    Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions, except to the
    extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date of that
    redemption or purchase, KeyCorp has received proceeds from the
    sale of qualifying securities that (i) have equity-like
    characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than,
    the applicable characteristics of the Trust Preferred
    Securities or the Junior Subordinated Debentures, as applicable,
    at the time of redemption or purchase, and (ii) KeyCorp has
    obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if
    such approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.
    KeyCorp will provide a copy of the Replacement Capital Covenants
    to respective holders of Covered Debt upon request made in
    writing to KeyCorp, Investor Relations, at 127 Public Square
    (Mail Code OH-01-27-1113), Cleveland, OH

44114-1306.

    each transaction, (ii) issuer, (iii) series of

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

An investment in our common shares is subject to risks inherent
    to our business. Described below are certain risks and
    uncertainties that management has identified as material. Before
    making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the
    risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the
    other information included or incorporated by reference in this
    report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the
    only ones we face. Although we have significant risk management
    policies, procedures and verification processes in place,
    additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware
    of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial
    may also impair our business operations. This report is
    qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.

If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our
    common shares could decline, perhaps significantly, and you
    could lose all or part of your investment.



Risks
    Related To Our Business

Disruptions
    in Financial Markets May Affect KeyCorp

Since July 2007, certain credit markets have experienced
    difficult conditions, extraordinary volatility and rapidly
    widening credit spreads and, therefore, have provided
    significantly reduced availability of liquidity for many
    borrowers. Uncertainties in these markets present significant
    challenges, particularly for the financial services industry. As
    a financial services company, our operations and financial
    condition are affected by economic and market conditions. For
    example, in the third and fourth quarters of 2007, disruptions
    in the financial markets caused widening credit spreads
    resulting in markdowns

and/or

losses by financial institutions from trading, hedging and other
    market activities. We are similarly affected. In addition,
    during the fourth quarter of 2007, we significantly increased
    our provision for loan losses in response to deteriorating
    market conditions in our commercial real estate portfolio. In an
    effort to reduce the potential effects of any prolonged market
    disruption, management has implemented certain strategic
    decisions, including securing additional outside sources of
    funding for certain of its businesses, divesting

and/or

ceasing to conduct certain of our non-core businesses and
    closely managing growth and investment opportunities. It is
    difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will
    exist, which of our markets, products or other businesses will
    ultimately be affected, and whether management’s actions
    will effectively mitigate these external factors. Accordingly,
    these factors could materially and adversely impact our
    financial condition and results of operations. Additional
    information regarding disruptions in financial markets is
    included in the section captioned “Highlights of Key’s
    2007 Performance — Financial outlook” beginning
    on page 22 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto). Additional information regarding
    certain strategic decisions management has implemented is
    included in the section captioned “Highlights of Key’s
    2007 Performance — Strategic developments”
    beginning on page 23 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net
    interest income. Net interest income is the difference between
    interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans
    and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing
    liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates
    are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our
    control, including general economic conditions, the competitive
    environment within our markets, consumer preferences for
    specific loan and deposit products and policies of various
    governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the
    Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including
    changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount
    of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of
    interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes
    could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain
    deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and
    liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other
    borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we
    receive on loans and other investments, our net interest income,
    and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings
    could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on
    loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest
    we pay on deposits and other borrowings. Management uses
    simulation analysis to produce an estimate of interest rate
    exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance
    sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business
    volume, pricing and anticipated hedging activities. Simulation
    analysis involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires
    estimates of future risks and trends. Accordingly, there can be
    no assurance that actual results will not differ from those
    derived in simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and
    frequency of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies
    employed, changes in balance sheet composition, and the possible
    effects of unanticipated or unknown events.

Although management believes it has implemented effective asset
    and liability management strategies, including simulation
    analysis and the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to
    reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our
    results of operations, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations. Additional information regarding interest rate risk
    is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Market risk management —
    Interest rate risk management” beginning on page 46 of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).



We Are
    Subject To Other Market Risk

Recent conditions in the fixed income markets, specifically the
    widening of credit spreads over benchmark U.S. Treasury
    securities for many fixed income securities, have caused
    significant volatility in the market values of loans,
    securities, and certain other financial instruments that are
    held in our trading or held-for-sale portfolios. Other market
    factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in
    the equity markets, changes in the financial soundness of bond
    insurers, sureties and even of other unrelated financial
    companies, also have the potential to affect current market
    values of financial instruments. Recent market events have
    demonstrated this effect. Although management works to minimize
    the adverse affects when it is feasible to do so, those
    opportunities are not always available. It is not possible for
    management to predict whether there will be further substantial
    changes in the financial markets, which could materially and
    adversely impact our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Additional information regarding market risk is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Market risk
    management — Trading portfolio risk management”
    beginning on page 48 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Credit Risk

There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading
    activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact
    of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic
    conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in
    interest rates

and/or

weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability
    of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the
    collateral securing these loans. We also are subject to various
    laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Failure
    to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us
    to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the
    assessment against us of civil money or other penalties.

As of December 31, 2007, approximately 74% of our loan
    portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural
    loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial
    mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These
    types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate
    loans and consumer loans. We closely monitor and manage risk
    concentrations and utilize various portfolio management
    practices to limit excessive concentrations when it is feasible
    to do so; however, our loan portfolio still contains a number of
    commercial loans with relatively large balances. The
    deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a
    significant increase in non-performing loans, and an increase in
    non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from
    these loans, an increase in the provision for possible loan
    losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional information regarding credit
    risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Credit risk management” beginning on
    page 51 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2007
    Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Various
    Factors May Cause Our Allowance For Possible Loan Losses To
    Increase

We maintain an allowance for possible loan losses, which is a
    reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses
    charged to expense, that represents management’s estimate
    of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The
    allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to
    reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan
    portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management’s
    continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific
    credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio
    quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions;
    and unexpected losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.
    The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for
    possible loan losses inherently involves a degree of
    subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of
    current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo
    material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting
    borrowers, new information regarding existing loans,
    identification of additional problem loans and other factors,
    both within and outside of our control, may require an increase
    in the allowance for possible loan losses. In addition, bank
    regulatory agencies and our independent auditors periodically
    review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase
    in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of
    further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ
    somewhat from those of our own management. In addition, if
    charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible
    loan losses (i.e., if the loan allowance is inadequate), we will
    need additional loan loss provisions to increase the allowance
    for possible loan losses. Additional provisions to increase the
    allowance for possible loan losses, should they become



necessary, would result in a decrease in net income and capital,
    and may have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition and results of operations. Additional information
    regarding the allowance for loan losses is included in the
    section captioned “Risk Management — Credit risk
    management — Allowance for loan losses” beginning
    on page 52 of the Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s
    2007 Annual Report to Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Liquidity Risk

Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the
    level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to
    accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet
    contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business
    transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and
    without adverse consequences. Although management has
    implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse
    sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as
    unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both
    normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected

and/or

prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. Certain credit markets that we participate in and
    rely upon as sources of funding have been significantly
    disrupted and highly volatile since the third quarter of 2007.
    These conditions increase our liquidity risk exposure. Part of
    our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves utilizing the
    liquidity and stability currently present in the short-term
    credit markets (borrowings with 0-90 day maturities). At
    this time, management believes short-term funding opportunities
    remain available and cost effective. However, if market
    disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness

and/or

the
    availability of supply in the short-term credit market for a
    prolonged period of time, management may utilize other potential
    means of accessing, funding and managing liquidity, including
    more expansive utilization of secured wholesale funding
    instruments, generating client deposits, securitizing or selling
    loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings,
    purchasing deposits from other banks, and relationships with
    fixed income investors in a variety of markets —
    domestic , European and Canadian — as well as
    increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities
    and other management tools. However, there can be no assurance
    that these alternative means of funding will exist either. For
    example, in 2007, Key was unable to securitize its student loan
    portfolio at cost-effective rates. Accordingly, a deep and
    prolonged disruption in the markets could have the effect of
    significantly restricting the accessibility of cost effective
    capital and funding which could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition and results of operations. Additional
    information regarding liquidity risk is included in the section
    captioned “Risk Management — Liquidity risk
    management” beginning on page 48 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We Are
    Subject To Operational Risk

We, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, which
    represents the risk of loss resulting from human error,
    inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and
    external events. Operational risk also encompasses compliance
    (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or
    noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices or ethical standards. Although we seek to mitigate
    operational risk through a system of internal controls,
    resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of
    explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our
    reputation or foregone opportunities, any and all of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional information regarding
    operational risk is included in the section captioned “Risk
    Management — Operational risk management”
    beginning on page 55 of the Financial Review section of
    KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Our
    Profitability Depends Significantly On Economic Conditions In
    The Geographic Regions In Which We Operate

Our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the
    markets in which we operate. Although we are somewhat
    geographically diversified, assisted in part in this respect by
    our “out of footprint” commercial real estate and
    equipment leasing lines of business, we still do have
    concentrations of loans and other business activities in
    geographic areas where our branches are principally
    located — the Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, the
    Great Lakes and the Northeast. We also have potential exposure
    to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint. For
    example, the residential properties segment of Key’s
    commercial real estate construction portfolio has been



adversely affected by the downturn in the U.S. housing
    market because of deteriorating market conditions, principally
    in Florida and southern California, and the significant increase
    in the level of nonperforming loans during the second half of
    2007. As a result, management recently increased the provision
    for loan losses. The regional economic conditions in areas in
    which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for
    our products and services as well as the ability of our
    customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing
    loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A
    significant decline in general economic conditions caused by
    inflation, recession, an act of terrorism, outbreak of
    hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences,
    unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors,
    such as severe declines in the value of homes and other real
    estate, could also impact these regional economies and, in turn,
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional information on the risks of
    the economic conditions of the geographic regions in which we
    operate is included in the section captioned
    “Introduction — Economic overview” beginning
    on page 16 and “Figure 1. Community Banking Geographic
    Diversity” beginning on page 17, which are part of the
    Financial Review section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to
    Shareholders (Exhibit 13 hereto).

We
    Operate In A Highly Competitive Industry And Market
    Areas

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations
    from a variety of different competitors, many of which are
    larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors
    primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as
    smaller community banks within the various markets in which we
    operate. However, we also face competition from many other types
    of financial institutions, including, without limitation,
    savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies,
    finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment
    management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and
    other local, regional and national financial services firms. The
    financial services industry could become even more competitive
    as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes
    and continued consolidation. Also, technology has lowered
    barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer
    products and services traditionally provided by banks.

Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of
    factors, including, among other things:

•

our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and
    initiatives;

•

our ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term
    customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical
    standards and safe, sound assets;

•

our ability to expand our market position;

•

the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services
    offered to meet customer needs and demands;

•

the rate at which we introduce new products and services
    relative to our competitors; and

•

industry and general economic trends.

Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly
    weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect
    our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

We Are
    Subject To Extensive Government Regulation And
    Supervision

We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and
    supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to
    protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds
    and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These
    regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure,
    investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other
    things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually
    review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible
    changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory
    policies; changes in the interpretation or implementation of
    statutes, regulations or policies;

and/or

continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices,
    requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional
    costs, limit the types of financial services and products that
    we may offer

and/or

increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial
    services and products, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with laws, regulations or policies
    (including internal policies and procedures designed to prevent
    such violations) could result in sanctions by regulatory
    agencies, civil money penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which



could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. Additional information
    regarding supervision and regulation is included in the section
    captioned “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1.
    Business, beginning on page 2 of this report.

Our
    Controls And Procedures May Fail Or Be
    Circumvented

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls,
    disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance
    policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions
    and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that
    the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or
    circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to
    comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

We
    Rely On Dividends From Our Subsidiaries For Most Of Our
    Funds

KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its cash flow
    from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the
    principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares
    and interest and principal on our debt. Various laws and
    regulations limit the amount of dividends that KeyBank
    (KeyCorp’s largest subsidiary) and certain non-bank
    subsidiaries may pay to KeyCorp. Also, KeyCorp’s right to
    participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s
    liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of
    the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event KeyBank is unable
    to pay dividends to KeyCorp, we may not be able to service debt,
    pay obligations or pay dividends on our common shares. The
    inability to receive dividends from KeyBank could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional information regarding dividend
    restrictions is included in the section captioned
    “Supervision and Regulation — Dividend
    Restrictions” in Item 1. Business, beginning on page 3
    of this report.

Our
    Earnings May Be Affected By Changes In Accounting Principles And
    In Tax Laws

Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    could have a significant adverse effect on Key’s reported
    financial results. Although these changes may not have an
    economic impact on our business, they could affect our ability
    to attain targeted levels for certain performance measures.

We, like all businesses, are subject to tax laws, rules and
    regulations. Changes to tax laws, rules and regulations,
    including changes in the interpretation or implementation of tax
    laws, rules and regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (the
    “IRS”) or other governmental bodies, could affect us
    in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could
    subject us to additional costs, among other things. Failure to
    appropriately comply with tax laws, rules and regulations could
    result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money
    penalties

and/or

reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Further, we are currently involved in litigation (previously
    reported in our SEC filings) with the IRS concerning the tax
    treatment of one Service Contract Lease entered into by AWG
    Leasing Trust. Our management believes our tax position is
    correct. Litigation, however, is uncertain. If the litigation is
    resolved against us, it could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations and a potentially substantial impact
    on our capital. Additional information concerning our income tax
    risks is included in the “Lease Financing
    Transactions” and the “Tax— Related Accounting
    Pronouncements Adopted in 2007” sections of Note 17
    (“Income Taxes”) on page 96 of the Financial Review
    section of KeyCorp’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders
    (Exhibit 13 hereto).

Potential
    Acquisitions May Disrupt Our Business And Dilute Shareholder
    Value

Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various
    risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among
    other things:

•

potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the
    target company;

•

exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;

•

difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and
    personnel of the target company;

•

potential disruption to our business;

•

potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;



•

the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target
    company;

•

difficulty in estimating the value (including goodwill) of the
    target company;

•

difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets,
    liabilities and derivatives of the target company; and

•

potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may
    affect the target company.

We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and
    conduct due diligence activities related to possible
    transactions with other financial institutions and financial
    services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition
    discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and
    future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity
    securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve
    the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,
    therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net
    income per common share may occur in connection with any future
    transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected
    revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or
    product presence,

and/or

other
    projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

We May
    Not Be Able To Attract And Retain Skilled People

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract
    and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
    activities in which we are engaged can be intense and we may not
    be able to hire or retain the people we want

and/or

need.
    Although we maintain employment agreements with certain key
    employees, and have incentive compensation plans aimed, in part,
    at long-term employee retention, the unexpected loss of services
    of one or more of our key personnel could still occur, and such
    events may have a material adverse impact on our business
    because of the loss of the employee’s skills, knowledge of
    our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of
    promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.

Our
    Information Systems May Experience An Interruption Or Breach In
    Security

We rely heavily on communications and information systems to
    conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in
    security of these systems could result in failures or
    disruptions in our customer relationship management, general
    ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies
    and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the
    possible failure, interruption or security breach of our
    information systems, there can be no assurance that any such
    failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if
    they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The
    occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of
    our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a
    loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory
    scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible
    financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We
    Continually Encounter Technological Change

The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid
    technological change with frequent introductions of new
    technology-driven products and services. The effective use of
    technology increases efficiency and enables financial
    institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our
    future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the
    needs of our customers by using technology to provide products
    and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to
    create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest
    competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in
    technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively
    implement new technology-driven products and services or be
    successful in marketing these products and services to our
    customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological
    change affecting the financial services industry could have a
    material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We Are
    Subject To Claims And Litigation

From time to time, customers

and/or

vendors may make claims and take legal action against us. We
    maintain reserves for certain claims when management deems it is
    appropriate to do so upon its assessment of the claims. Whether
    any particular claims and legal actions are founded or
    unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in
    our favor they may result in significant financial liability

and/or

adversely affect how the market



perceives us and our products and services as well as impact
    customer demand for those products and services. Any financial
    liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves,

and/or

any
    reputation damage from such claims and legal actions, could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

Severe
    Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or Terrorism And Other
    External Events Could Significantly Impact Our
    Business

Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and
    other adverse external events could have a significant impact on
    our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the
    stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers
    to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral
    securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in
    loss of revenue

and/or

cause
    us to incur additional expenses. Although management has
    established disaster recovery plans and procedures, the
    occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Risks
    Associated With Our Common Shares

Our
    Share Price Can Be Volatile

Share price volatility may make it more difficult for you to
    resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find
    attractive. Our share price can fluctuate significantly in
    response to a variety of factors including, among other things:

•

Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
    operations.

•

Recommendations by securities analysts.

•

Operating and stock price performance of other companies that
    investors deem comparable to our business.

•

News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in
    the financial services industry.

•

Perceptions of us

and/or

our
    competitors in the marketplace.

•

New technology used, or services offered, by competitors.

•

Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic
    partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments entered into
    by us or our competitors.

•

Failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated
    benefits from acquisitions.

•

Changes in government regulations.

•

Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or
    military conflicts.

General market fluctuations, market disruption, industry factors
    and general economic and political conditions and events, such
    as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or
    credit loss trends, could also cause our share price to decrease
    regardless of operating results.

An
    Investment In Our Common Shares Is Not An Insured
    Deposit

Our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not
    insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance
    fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our
    common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in
    this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
    report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the
    price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you
    acquire our common shares, you may lose some or all of your
    investment.



Our
    Articles Of Incorporation And Regulations As Well As
    Certain Banking Laws May Have An

Anti-Takeover

Effect

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations,
    federal banking laws, including regulatory approval
    requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to
    acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial
    to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may
    inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination,
    which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our
    common shares.

Risks
    Associated With Our Industry

The
    Earnings Of Financial Services Companies Are Significantly
    Affected By General Business And Economic
    Conditions

Our operations and profitability are impacted by general
    business and economic conditions in the United States and
    abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term
    interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues,
    legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt
    and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and
    finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local
    economies in which we operate, all of which are beyond our
    control. A deterioration in economic conditions could result in
    an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets,
    decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for
    our products and services, among other things, any of which
    could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Financial
    Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy And Completeness Of
    Information About Customers And Counterparties

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other
    transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on
    behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial
    statements, credit reports and other financial information. We
    may also rely on representations of those customers,
    counterparties or other third parties, such as independent
    auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that
    information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial
    statements, credit reports or other financial information could
    have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Consumers
    May Decide Not To Use Banks To Complete Their Financial
    Transactions

Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete
    through alternative methods financial transactions that
    historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now
    maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would
    have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also
    complete transactions such as paying bills

and/or

transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The
    process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as
    “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee
    income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related
    income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue
    streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation,
    KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the design and operation of these
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all
    material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this
    report. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control
    over financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the last fiscal quarter that
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.
