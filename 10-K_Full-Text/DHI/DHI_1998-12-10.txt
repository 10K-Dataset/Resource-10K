FORM 10-K FOR D.R. HORTON, INC.


                           OVER $2 BILLION IN REVENUES

Dear Stockholders:

     New records in  revenues  and  earnings  allowed the Company to achieve its
21st consecutive year of growth and profitability,  and made D.R. Horton the 3rd
largest homebuilder in the United States.


1998 WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL YEAR IN WHICH WE:

    o Merged with Continental Homes Holding Corp. and acquired three companies:

          C.  Richard  Dobson  Builders,  Inc.   on  the  southeastern  seaboard
            (February 1998)
          Mareli Development and Construction in Louisville (May 1998)
          RMP Properties, Inc. in Portland (June 1998).

    o Restructured  our  homebuilding  bank credit  facilities to aggregate $825
      million with terms up to 4 years at reduced borrowing rates.  Further,  we
      entered into an additional  $200 million in interest rate swap  agreements
      to fix the interest rate on a portion of this debt.

    o Increased our quarterly cash dividend by 12 1/2%.

    o Expanded  mortgage  services to our homebuyers,  through our  wholly-owned
      subsidiary,  CH  Mortgage,  Ltd.  We  established  a separate  $75 million
      warehouse bank credit line to finance this activity.

    o Commenced  startup  operations  in Sacramento  and initiated  title agency
      operations in Miami and Minneapolis.

    o Provided stockholders with a 22% return on beginning stockholders' equity.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 1998 WE INCREASED:

    o Pre-tax income 47% to $159 million

    o Revenues 38% to $2.2 billion (13,944 homes)

    o New sales orders 59% to $2.5 billion (15,952 homes)

    o Year end sales backlog 73% to $1.1 billion (6,341 homes)

    o Stockholders' equity 28% to $549 million

    o Total assets 34% to $1.7 billion


ANNUAL AWARDS

     Each year, D.R. Horton formally recognizes outstanding achievements through
its individual and divisional  awards.  We  congratulate  our 1998 recipients of
these awards, who were:

    o The Los Angeles Division  managed by Gerald Nordeman,  was named "Division
      of the Year" by the managers of the Company's other divisions.

    o Cesi Pagano, of our Los Angeles  Division,  led the Company by selling the
      highest dollar volume of homes and is our "Sales Person of the Year".

    o Don Rampy, of our Continental Denver Division, is our "Construction Person
      of the Year" for supervising construction of the most homes in 1998.



     Since September 30 (year end) we:

          Converted the remaining outstanding  convertible notes to common stock
          increasing our stockholders'  equity by $58 million, to more than $600
          million.

          Announced the promotions of  Donald J. Tomnitz  to  Vice Chairman  and
          Chief Executive Officer and Richard Beckwitt to President.

          Approved  programs to  repurchase  up to $100  million  each of common
          stock and senior debt securities, if market conditions warrant.


1999 AND BEYOND

     More important  than our past, we have set the stage for continued  success
in 1999 and beyond.

     We look  forward  to a highly  successful  year ahead and  anticipate  D.R.
Horton will enjoy its 22nd year of growth and  profitability.  Some of our goals
for 2000 are to exceed $4 billion in revenues, and we plan to continue to be one
of the most profitable companies in the homebuilding  industry. We invite you to
follow our progress and become more  familiar  with our Company by accessing our
website at http://www.DRHORTON.com.

     Our rapid growth requires that we attract, develop and retain very talented
personnel.  Effective January 1, 1999, we will enhance our overall  Company-wide
employee  benefits to reward our existing  employees and to help attract  future
talent to the Company.  We commend all our  employees  for their  assistance  in
making 1998 an  exceptional  year and ask their help in making 1999 even better.
We also extend thanks to our  shareholders  and  customers  for their  continued
investment and interest in D.R. Horton, Inc.

     Our  history  demonstrates  not  only  our  ability  to grow by  initiating
operations in new markets, but also our success in acquiring companies that make
immediate  contributions to our earnings.  We continuously  explore  acquisition
candidates and new markets and plan to enter new markets annually. Additionally,
we see  significant  opportunities  to expand our mortgage  services to a larger
number  of  our  homebuyers.  The  continuous  growth  of  our  Company  through
geographic expansion is unmatched by anyone in the industry.


                                                      /s/ DONALD R. HORTON

                                     PART I


ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     D.R.  Horton,  Inc.  (the  "Company"  or  "Horton")  constructs  and  sells
single-family  homes  in  metropolitan  areas  of  the  Mid-Atlantic,   Midwest,
Southeast,   Southwest,  and  West  regions  of  the  United  States.  We  offer
high-quality homes,  designed principally for first time and move up homebuyers.
Our homes  generally  range in size from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet and range in
price from $80,000 to $600,000. For the year ended September 30, 1998, we closed
homes with an average  sales price  approximating  $153,300.  Although,  we have
historically positioned ourselves as a custom builder, we have recently acquired
two volume  building  companies which will enable us to compete across a broader
product offering.

     On  April  20,  1998,   we  acquired   Continental   Homes   Holding  Corp.
("Continental"), a geographically diversified homebuilder, through the merger of
Continental   into  Horton  (the  "Merger").   In  the  Merger,   Horton  issued
approximately  15.5  million  shares  of its  common  stock,  and  Continental's
outstanding  convertible  securities  and  options  became  convertible  into or
exercisable for an additional 8.2 million  shares.  The Merger was accounted for
as a pooling of interests.  Accordingly,  all  information for prior periods has
been restated to show the combined results of Horton and Continental.

     We are  one of the  most  geographically  diversified  homebuilders  in the
United  States,  with  operating  divisions  in 23 states  and 41  markets as of
September 30, 1998.

     The markets we operate in include:

     Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Charleston, Charlotte,
     Chicago,  Cincinnati,  Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver,  Greensboro,  Greenville,
     Hilton Head, Houston,  Jacksonville,  Kansas City, Killeen,  Las Vegas, Los
     Angeles, Louisville,  Minneapolis/St. Paul, Miami, Myrtle Beach, Nashville,
     New  Jersey,   Newport  News,  Orlando,   Pensacola,   Phoenix,   Portland,
     Raleigh/Durham,  Richmond,  Sacramento,  Salt Lake City,  San Antonio,  San
     Diego, St. Louis, Tucson, Suburban Washington, D.C. and Wilmington.

     We build homes under the following names: D.R. Horton, Joe Miller, Arappco,
Regency, Trimark, Torrey, SGS, Dobson, Continental, Milburn, RMP and Mareli.

     We were  incorporated  in Delaware  on July 1, 1991,  to acquire all of the
assets and businesses of 25 predecessor  companies,  which were residential home
construction and development companies owned or controlled by Donald R. Horton.

     Our principal  executive offices are located at 1901 Ascension Blvd., Suite
100, Arlington, Texas 76006, and its telephone number is (817) 856-8200.



Operating Strategy

     We believe  that the  following  operating  strategies  have  enabled us to
achieve consistent growth and profitability:


   Geographic Diversification

     From 1978 to late 1987, excluding Continental  locations,  our homebuilding
activities  were conducted in the  Dallas/Fort  Worth area. We then instituted a
policy of  diversifying  geographically,  entering the following  markets in the
years shown:

         Year Entered       Markets
         ------------       -------
         1987.............. Phoenix
         1988.............. Atlanta, Orlando
         1989.............. Charlotte
         1990.............. Houston
         1991.............. Suburban Washington, D.C.
         1992.............. Chicago, Cincinnati, Raleigh/Durham, South Florida
         1993.............. Austin, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Diego
         1994.............. Minneapolis / St.  Paul,  Kansas  City,  Las  Vegas,
                            San Antonio
         1995.............. Birmingham, Denver, Greensboro, St. Louis
         1996.............. Albuquerque, Pensacola
         1997.............. Greenville, Nashville, New Jersey, Tucson
         1998.............. Baltimore,  Charleston,  Hilton Head,  Jacksonville,
                            Killeen,  Louisville,  Myrtle  Beach,  Newport News,
                            Portland, Richmond, Sacramento, Wilmington

     We  continually  monitor  the sales  and  margins  achieved  in each of the
subdivisions  in which we  operate as part of our  evaluation  of the use of our
capital.  While we believe there are  significant  growth  opportunities  in our
existing markets, we intend to continue our policy of diversification by seeking
to enter new markets.  We believe our  diversification  strategy  mitigates  the
effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth potential.
Typically,  we will not invest  material  amounts in real estate,  including raw
land,  developed  lots,  models and  speculative  homes, or overhead in start-up
operations  in new markets  until such markets  demonstrate  significant  growth
potential and acceptance of our products.


   Acquisitions

     As  an  integral  component  of  our  operational   strategy  of  continued
expansion, we continually evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions.  We
believe  that  expanding  our  operations  through the  acquisition  of existing
homebuilding  companies  affords  us  several  benefits  not  found in  start-up
operations. Such benefits include:

    o Established land positions and inventories

    o Existing  relationships with land owners,  developers,  subcontractors and
      suppliers

    o Brand name recognition

    o Proven product acceptance by homebuyers in the market

     In  evaluating  potential  acquisition  candidates,  we  seek  homebuilding
companies that have an excellent reputation, a track record of profitability and
a strong management team with an entrepreneurial orientation. We limit the risks
associated with acquiring a going concern by conducting  extensive  operational,
financial  and legal due  diligence on each  acquisition  and by only  acquiring
homebuilding companies that we believe will have an immediate positive impact on
our earnings.



     During the last five fiscal years, we have made the following acquisitions,
including those of Continental prior to the merger:

         Date Acquired     Entities Acquired           Markets  
         -------------     -----------------           -------
         January 1994      Aspen Homes                 San Antonio

                                                       Raleigh/Durham

         February 1998     C. Richard Dobson           Charleston, Charlotte, 
                           Builders, Inc.              Greensboro, Greenville,
                                                       Hilton Head, 
                                                       Jacksonville, Myrtle 
                                                       Beach, Newport News, 
                                                       Raleigh, Richmond, 
                                                       Wilmington

         April 1998        Continental Homes           Phoenix, Austin, San
                           Holding Corp.               Diego, Dallas, Denver,
                                                       Miami, San Antonio

         May 1998          Mareli Development &        Louisville 
                           Construction Company, LLC      

         June 1998         RMP Properties, Inc.        Portland

     We will continue to evaluate  potential  future  acquisition  opportunities
that satisfy our acquisition criteria in both existing and new markets.


   Decentralized Operations

     We  decentralize  our  homebuilding   activities  to  give  more  operating
flexibility  to our  local  division  managers.  We have 53  separate  operating
divisions,  some of which are in the same market area. Generally, each operating
division  consists of a vice  president,  an office  manager and staff,  a sales
manager and a construction  manager. We believe that division managers,  who are
intimately familiar with local conditions, make better decisions regarding local
operations than do the  centralized,  corporate  management  teams who make such
decisions for many of our competitors. Our division managers receive performance
bonuses  based  upon  achieving  targeted  operating  levels in their  operating
divisions.

     Each operating division is responsible for:

    o Site selection which involves

      --    A feasibility study

      --    Soil and environmental reviews

      --    Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements

      --    Review of  the need for  and extent of offsite work required to meet
            local building codes

    o Negotiating lot option or similar contracts

    o Overseeing land development



    o Planning its homebuilding schedule

    o Selecting building plans and architectural schemes

    o Obtaining all necessary building approvals

    o Developing a marketing plan


   Corporate office controls

     The corporate office controls key risk elements through centralized:

    o Financing

    o Cash management

    o Risk management

    o Accounting and management reporting

    o Payment of subcontractor invoices

    o Administration of payroll and employee benefits

    o Final approval of land and lot acquisitions

    o Capital allocation

    o Oversight of inventory levels


   Cost Management

     We control our overhead costs by centralizing administrative and accounting
functions  and by  limiting  the number of field  administrative  personnel  and
middle  level  management  positions.  We also  minimize  advertising  costs  by
participating in promotional activities,  publications and newsletters sponsored
by local real estate brokers,  mortgage  companies,  utility companies and trade
associations.

     We control construction costs through the efficient design of our homes and
by obtaining favorable pricing from certain  subcontractors and national vendors
based on the high  volume of  services  they  perform  for us.  We also  control
construction  costs by  monitoring  expenses on each house  through our purchase
order system.  We control capital and overhead costs by monitoring our inventory
levels through our management information systems.


Markets

     Homebuilding   activities  are  conducted  in  five   geographic   regions,
consisting of:

      Geographic Region                             Markets
      -----------------                             -------                     
      Mid-Atlantic........... Baltimore,  Charleston,   Charlotte,   Greensboro,
                              Greenville, Hilton Head, Myrtle Beach, New Jersey,
                              Newport News,  Raleigh/Durham,  Richmond, Suburban
                              Washington, D.C. and Wilmington
      Midwest................ Chicago,  Cincinnati,  Kansas  City,   Louisville,
                              Minneapolis/St. Paul, St. Louis
      Southeast.............. Atlanta,  Birmingham,   Jacksonville,   Nashville,
                              Orlando, Pensacola, South Florida
      Southwest.............. Albuquerque, Austin,  Dallas/Fort Worth,  Houston,
                              Killeen, Phoenix, San Antonio, Tucson
      West................... Denver,   Las  Vegas,   Los  Angeles,    Portland,
                              Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Diego



     When  entering new markets or conducting  operations  in existing  markets,
among the things we consider are:

    o Regional economic conditions

    o Job growth

    o Land availability

    o Local land development process

    o Consumer tastes

    o Competition

    o Secondary home sales activity

     Our homebuilding revenues by geographic region are:



Land Policies

     Typically,  we acquire land and enter into lot option  contracts to acquire
developed building lots only after necessary  "entitlements" have been obtained,
i.e.,  when we have the right to begin  development or  construction.  Before we
acquire  lots or  tracts  of land,  we will,  among  other  things,  complete  a
feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent  environmental studies
and other  engineering  work, and determine that all necessary  zoning and other
governmental  entitlements  required  to develop and use the  property  for home
construction  have been acquired.  At September 30, 1998, about 60% of our total
lot position of 52,054 lots was being or had been  developed by us.  Although we
purchase and develop land primarily to support our own homebuilding  activities,
occasionally we sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders.

     We also use lot option contracts,  where we purchase the right, but not the
obligation,  to buy building lots at predetermined prices on a takedown schedule
commensurate with anticipated home closings.  Lot option contracts generally are
on a nonrecourse basis, thereby limiting our financial exposure to earnest money
deposits given to property sellers.  This enables us to control  significant lot
positions  with  minimal up front  capital and  substantially  reduces the risks
associated with land ownership and development.

     A summary of our land/lot position at September 30, 1998 is:




     We limit our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

    o Generally  commencing  construction  of homes  under  contract  only after
      receipt of a satisfactory down payment and, where applicable,  the buyer's
      receipt of mortgage approval

    o Limiting  the  number of  speculative  homes  (homes  started  without  an
      executed sales contract) built in each subdivision

    o Closely   monitoring   local  market  and  demographic   trends,   housing
      preferences   and  related   economic   developments,   such  as  new  job
      opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends

    o Utilizing lot option contracts, where possible

    o Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts of land

Construction

     Our home  designs  are  prepared  by  architects  in each of our markets to
appeal to local tastes and preferences of the community.  We also offer optional
interior and  exterior  features to enhance the basic home design and to promote
our sales efforts.

     Substantially all of our construction work is performed by  subcontractors.
Our construction  supervisors monitor the construction of each home, participate
in  material  design  and  building  decisions,  coordinate  the  activities  of
subcontractors and suppliers,  subject the work of subcontractors to quality and
cost  controls  and  monitor   compliance   with  zoning  and  building   codes.
Subcontractors  typically are retained for a specific  subdivision pursuant to a
contract that obligates the  subcontractor  to complete  construction at a fixed
price. Agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are negotiated
for  each  subdivision.   We  compete  with  other  homebuilders  for  qualified
subcontractors, raw materials and lots in the markets where we operate.

     Construction  time for our homes  depends on the weather,  availability  of
labor, materials and supplies, size of the home, and other factors. We typically
complete the construction of a home within four months.

     We do not  maintain  significant  inventories  of  construction  materials,
except for work in process  materials for homes under  construction.  Typically,
the  construction  materials used in our  operations are readily  available from
numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of
our building  materials that are cancellable at our option with a 30 day notice.
In recent years, we have not experienced any significant  delays in construction
due to shortages of materials or labor.


Marketing and Sales

     We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and independent
real estate  brokers.  Home sales  typically  are  conducted  from sales offices
located in furnished model homes in each subdivision.  At September 30, 1998, we
owned 532 model  homes,  which  generally  are not  offered  for sale  until the
completion of a subdivision.  Our sales personnel assist prospective  homebuyers
by providing them with floor plans, price information,  tours of model homes and
the  selection  of options and other  custom  features.  We train and inform our
sales personnel as to the availability of financing,  construction schedules and
marketing and advertising plans.

     In addition to using model homes,  we typically  build a limited  number of
speculative  homes in each  subdivision  to  enhance  our  marketing  and  sales
activities. Construction of these speculative homes also is necessary to satisfy
the  requirement  of relocated  personnel  and  independent  brokers,  who often
represent  homebuyers  requiring a completed  home within 60 days. A majority of
these  speculative  homes  are sold  while  under  construction  or  immediately
following  completion.  The number of  speculative  homes is influenced by local
market  factors,   such  as  new  employment   opportunities,   significant  job
relocations,  growing housing demand and the length of time we have built in the
market.  Depending upon the seasonality of each market,  we attempt to limit our
speculative homes in each subdivision. At September 30, 1998, we operated in 540
subdivisions   and  averaged  5  speculative   homes,   in  various   stages  of
construction, in each subdivision.



     We advertise on a limited  basis in newspapers  and in real estate  broker,
mortgage   company  and  utility   publications,   brochures,   newsletters  and
billboards. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate in subdivisions
in  conspicuous  locations  that permit us to take  advantage  of local  traffic
patterns.  We also  believe  that  model  homes play a  significant  role in our
marketing  efforts.  Consequently,  we expend  significant effort in creating an
attractive atmosphere in our model homes.

     Our sales contracts  require a down payment of at least $500. The contracts
include a financing  contingency which permit customers to cancel if they cannot
obtain  mortgage  financing  at  prevailing  interest  rates  within a specified
period,  typically four to six weeks, and may include other contingencies,  such
as the sale of an  existing  home.  We include a home sale in our sales  backlog
when the sales contract is signed and we have received the initial down payment.
We do not recognize revenue upon the sale of a home until it is closed and title
passes to the  homebuyer.  The  average  period  between  the signing of a sales
contract for a home and closing is approximately three to five months.


Customer Service and Quality Control

     Our operating  divisions are responsible for  pre-closing,  quality control
inspections  and responding to customers'  post-closing  needs.  We believe that
prompt and courteous response to homebuyers' needs during and after construction
reduces  post-closing  repair  costs,  enhances our  reputation  for quality and
service,  and ultimately leads to significant  repeat and referral business from
the real estate  community  and  homebuyers.  We provide our  homebuyers  with a
limited   one-year   warranty  on  workmanship  and  building   materials.   The
subcontractors  who  perform  most  of  the  actual  construction  also  provide
warranties of workmanship to us and are generally  prepared to respond to us and
the homeowner  promptly upon request.  In most cases, we supplement our one-year
warranty by purchasing a ten-year  limited warranty from a third party. To cover
our potential  warranty  obligations,  we accrue an estimated  amount for future
warranty costs.


Customer Financing

     We provide mortgage financing  services  principally to purchasers of homes
we build and sell. CH Mortgage,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary,  provides  mortgage
banking  services  in  Arizona,  Colorado,  Kentucky,  Nevada,  North  and South
Carolina,  Minnesota,  Texas and Florida. D.R. Horton Mortgage Company,  Ltd., a
joint venture formed in 1998 with a third party,  presently provides services in
California.  On a combined basis,  related mortgage  banking  entities  provided
mortgage  financing  services for about 42% of the homes closed  during the year
ended September 30, 1998. We anticipate  expanding these mortgage  activities to
other markets we serve.

     In other markets where we currently do not provide mortgage  financing,  we
work with a variety of mortgage  lenders  that make  available  to  homebuyers a
range of conventional  mortgage financing programs.  By making information about
these   programs   available  to  prospective   homebuyers  and   maintaining  a
relationship with such mortgage lenders,  we are able to coordinate and expedite
the entire sales transaction by ensuring that mortgage  commitments are received
and that closings take place on a timely and efficient basis.


Title Services

     Through our wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  DRH Title Company of Texas,  Ltd.,
DRH Title Company of Florida,  Inc.,  DRH Title  Company of Minnesota,  Inc. and
Travis County Title Company,  we serve as a title  insurance  agent by providing
title  insurance  policies and closing  services to purchasers of homes we build
and sell in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Orlando,  Miami,  Minneapolis and San
Antonio  markets.  We assume no  underwriting  risk  associated with these title
policies.


Employees

     At September 30, 1998, we employed  2,465  persons,  of whom 629 were sales
and  marketing  personnel,  757  were  executive,  administrative  and  clerical
personnel,  844 were  involved in  construction,  and 235 worked in mortgage and
title  operations.  Fewer than 25 of our  employees  are  covered by  collective



bargaining  agreements.  Some of the subcontractors which we use are represented
by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining  agreements.  We believe
that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.


Competition

     The single family residential housing industry is highly  competitive,  and
we compete in each of our markets with  numerous  other  national,  regional and
local  homebuilders,  often  with  larger  subdivisions  designed,  planned  and
developed  by such  homebuilders.  Our homes  compete  on the basis of  quality,
price, design, mortgage financing terms and location.


Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters

     The  housing,  mortgage  and title  insurance  industries  are  subject  to
extensive and complex  regulations.  We and our subcontractors  must comply with
various federal,  state and local laws and regulations including zoning, density
and development requirements, building, environmental,  advertising and consumer
credit  rules  and  regulations,  as well as  other  rules  and  regulations  in
connection  with our  development,  homebuilding  and  sales  activities.  These
include  requirements  affecting  the  development  process as well as  building
materials to be used, building designs and minimum elevation of properties.  Our
homes are inspected by local authorities where required,  and homes eligible for
insurance or guarantees  provided by the FHA and VA are subject to inspection by
them.  These  regulations  often provide broad  discretion to the  administering
governmental authorities.  This can delay or increase the cost of development or
homebuilding.

     We also are  subject to a variety  of local,  state and  federal  statutes,
ordinances,  rules and  regulations  concerning  protection  of  health  and the
environment.  The  particular  environmental  laws for each  site  vary  greatly
according to location,  environmental  condition and the present and former uses
of the site and adjoining  properties.  These  environmental  laws may result in
delays,  may cause us to incur  substantial  compliance and other costs, and can
prohibit or severely restrict  development and homebuilding  activity in certain
environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

     Our internal  mortgage  activities and title  insurance  agencies must also
comply  with  various  federal  and  state  laws,   consumer  credit  rules  and
regulations and rules and regulations  unique to such activities.  Additionally,
mortgage loans and title activities  originated under the FHA, VA, FNMA and GNMA
are subject to rules and regulations imposed by those agencies.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     We  own  a  52,000  square  foot  office   complex,   consisting  of  three
single-story  buildings of steel and brick  construction,  located in Arlington,
Texas,  that  serves as the  principal  executive  offices and houses two of the
Dallas/Fort Worth divisions.  We also lease approximately 213,000 square feet of
space for our operating divisions under leases expiring between October 1998 and
June 2006.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     We are a party to  routine  litigation  incidental  to our  business.  Such
matters,  if decided  adversely to us, would not, in the opinion of  management,
have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition.


ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     None.



                                     PART II


ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

     Our  common  stock  (the  "Common  Stock")  is listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "DHI". The following table sets forth the high and low
sales prices for the Common Stock for the periods indicated.



     As of  November  30,  1998,  the closing  price was $18 7/8, and there were
approximately 286 holders of record.  We have declared  quarterly cash dividends
of 2 cents per share for fiscal 1997 and 2 1/4 cents per share for fiscal 1998.

     The  declaration  of cash  dividends is at the  discretion  of our Board of
Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows,
capital  requirements,  our general  financial  condition  and general  business
conditions.  We are required to comply with certain  covenants  contained in the
bank  agreements  and Senior Notes  indentures.  The most  restrictive  of these
requirements  allows us to pay cash dividends on common stock in an amount, on a
cumulative  basis,  not to exceed 50% of  consolidated  net income,  as defined,
subject to certain other adjustments.  Pursuant to the most restrictive of these
requirements,  we had  approximately  $65.6 million available for the payment of
dividends at September 30, 1998.


ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     The following  selected  consolidated  financial  data are derived from our
Consolidated  Financial Statements.  The data should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements, related Notes thereto and other financial
data elsewhere herein.  These historical results are not necessarily  indicative
of the results to be expected in the future.






               MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
                       OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Results of Operations -- Consolidated

     D.R. Horton,  Inc. and subsidiaries  (the "Company")  provide  homebuilding
activities in 23 states and 41 markets  through its 53  homebuilding  divisions.
Through its financial  services  activities,  the Company also provides mortgage
banking and title agency services in many of these same markets.

     On April 20, 1998, D.R. Horton, Inc. ("Horton") acquired  Continental Homes
Holding Corp. ("Continental"), a geographically diversified homebuilder, through
the merger of  Continental  into Horton (the  "Merger").  In the Merger,  Horton
issued  approximately 15.5 million shares of its common stock, and Continental's
outstanding  convertible  securities  and  options  became  convertible  into or
exercisable for an additional  approximately 8.2 million shares.  The Merger was
accounted  for  as a  pooling  of  interests.  Accordingly,  Horton's  financial
information for prior periods has been restated to show the combined  results of
Horton and  Continental.  In the  description  of  business  that  follows,  the
business of Continental has been combined with Horton as though  Continental had
been a part of Horton throughout the periods described.


Year Ended September 30, 1998 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1997

     Consolidated  revenues  increased  37.9% to  $2,176.9  million in 1998 from
$1,578.4  million in 1997 due to increases in both  homebuilding  and  financial
services revenues.

     Consolidated selling,  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased
34.9% to $231.7  million in 1998 from $171.8 million in 1997. As a percentage of
consolidated  revenues,  SG&A expenses  decreased to 10.6% in 1998 from 10.9% in
1997.  Consolidated  1998 SG&A expenses  exclude $11.9 million in  non-recurring
costs  associated with the Merger with  Continental.  The merger costs consisted
primarily of fees to third party investment, accounting and legal advisors.

     Consolidated interest expense increased to $16.2 million in 1998 from $10.9
million  in  1997  due to the  increased  interest  costs  associated  with  the
Company's rapidly expanding financial services operations, increased debt levels
from acquisitions and expansion of homebuilding  activities.  Financial services
interest  expense grew from $0.7  million in 1997 to $2.2 million in 1998.  As a
percentage of consolidated revenues,  interest expense was 0.7% in both 1998 and
1997.

     Consolidated  other  income  consists  mainly of  interest  income on funds
temporarily invested and, for financial services  operations,  on mortgage loans
held for sale.  In 1998,  consolidated  other income was $7.6  million,  up $2.2
million from 1997,  primarily due to larger  amounts of  temporarily  investable
funds and mortgage loans held for sale.

     Non-recurring  merger costs  associated  with the  Continental  merger were
$11.9  million and consisted  primarily of fees paid to third party  investment,
accounting, and legal advisors.

     The  consolidated  provision  for income taxes  increased  50.8%,  to $65.7
million in 1998,  from $43.6 million in 1997,  due in part to the  corresponding
increase  in  income  before  income  taxes.  As a  percentage  of  consolidated
revenues,  the  income  tax  provision  increased  by 0.2% to 3.0% in 1998.  The
increase as a  percentage  of revenues  was due  primarily to an increase in the
total  effective  income tax rate in 1998,  from  40.2% to 41.3%,  caused by the
non-deductibility  of certain of the 1998 merger costs and increased earnings in
states with higher effective tax rates.


Year Ended September 30, 1997 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1996

     Consolidated  revenues  increased  37.5% to  $1,578.4  million in 1997 from
$1,147.7 million in 1996 due to the increase in homebuilding revenues.  Revenues
from financial services operations  decreased by 4.5% in 1997 due to a 1996 sale
of servicing  rights that resulted in  recognition of $0.9 million of revenue in
1996.



     Consolidated  SG&A  expenses  increased by 39.5% to $171.8  million in 1997
from  $123.1  million  in  1996.  As  a  percentage  of  consolidated  revenues,
consolidated SG&A expenses  increased to 10.9% in 1997 from 10.7% in 1996 due in
part to startup expenses incurred in new financial services markets.

     Consolidated  interest expense increased to $10.9 million in 1997 from $9.2
million in 1996, primarily due to the corresponding  increase in inventories and
acquisitions  financed  through  available  lines of credit.  As a percentage of
consolidated  revenues,  interest expense decreased to 0.7% in 1997 from 0.8% in
1996.

     Consolidated  other income,  which  consists  mainly of interest  income on
funds temporarily invested and, for financial services  operations,  on mortgage
loans held for resale,  increased  to $5.4  million in 1997 from $4.5 million in
1996.

     The  consolidated  provision  for income taxes  increased  18.9%,  to $43.6
million in 1997 from $36.6  million  in 1996,  due in part to the  corresponding
increase in income  before income  taxes.  The  effective tax rate  decreased to
40.2% in 1997 from 40.8% in 1996,  due to greater  earnings in states with lower
tax rates.


Results of Operations -- Homebuilding

     The following tables set forth certain operating and financial data for the
Company's homebuilding activities:








Year Ended September 30, 1998 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1997

     Revenues from homebuilding  activities  increased 37.5% to $2,155.0 million
(13,944  homes closed) in 1998 from  $1,567.5  million  (10,038 homes closed) in
1997,  despite a decrease  in land  sales  from  $34.8  million in 1997 to $16.8
million in 1998.  The number of homes closed  increased in all of the  Company's
market  regions,   with  percentage   increases   ranging  from  143.9%  in  the
Mid-Atlantic  region to 15.4% in the  Southwest  region.  The  increases in both
revenues  and homes  closed were due to strong  housing  demand,  the  Company's
entrance  into  new  markets,   and  the  home  closings   associated  with  the
acquisitions of C. Richard Dobson Builders, Inc. (Dobson), which was acquired in
February,  1998;  Mareli  Development & Construction Co. (Mareli) of Louisville,
Kentucky,  acquired in May, 1998; and RMP  Development,  Inc. (RMP) of Portland,
Oregon,  acquired in June, 1998. In markets in which the Company operated during
both fiscal years, revenues increased by 26.5% to $1,939.4 million (12,591 homes
closed).  The  average  selling  price of  homes  closed  in 1998 was  $153,300,
substantially unchanged from 1997.

     New net sales contracts increased 51.2% to 15,952 homes in 1998 from 10,551
in 1997.  Percentage increases in new net sales contracts ranging from 180.8% to
28.5% were achieved in the Company's  market  regions.  The increases in new net
sales contracts were due in part to sales achieved by the 1998 acquisitions.  In
markets  in which the  Company  operated  in both  fiscal  years,  new net sales
contracts  increased 37.2%, to 14,480 homes. The average amount of new net sales
contracts in 1998 was $158,800, up 5.0% from the $151,200 average in 1997.



     The Company was  operating  in 540  subdivisions  at  September  30,  1998,
compared to 377 at September  30, 1997.  At September  30, 1998,  the  Company's
backlog of sales contracts was $1,052.9 million (6,341 homes), up 72.8% from the
comparable  amount at  September  30,  1997.  In  markets  in which the  Company
operated during both fiscal years, the sales contract backlog was $978.9 million
(5,850  homes),  up 60.7% from 1997.  The average  sales price of homes in sales
backlog was $166,000 at September 30, 1998, up 7.9% from the $153,800 average at
September 30, 1997.

     Cost of sales increased by 36.6%, to $1,765.6 million in 1998 from $1,292.6
million in 1997. The increase in cost of sales was  attributable to the increase
in revenues.  Cost of sales as a percentage  of revenues  decreased by 0.5%,  to
81.9% in 1998 from  82.4% in 1997,  due to  excellent  housing  demand  allowing
increases in selling prices in certain markets, efforts to enhance gross margins
through efficiencies and materials discounts and purchase accounting adjustments
in 1997 that required the Company to increase its basis in acquired inventory.

     Selling,  general and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  from  homebuilding
activities  increased by 32.8% to $216.4  million in 1998 from $163.0 million in
1997. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased to 10.0% in 1998 from
10.4% in 1997.  The  decrease in SG&A  expenses as a  percentage  of revenues is
primarily due to the Company's cost containment  efforts, the increased revenues
that  absorb  the  fixed  elements  of  overhead,   and  costs  associated  with
integrating the 1997 acquisitions into the Company.

     Interest expense associated with homebuilding activities increased to $14.0
million  in  1998  from  $10.2  million  in  1997  due to the  increase  in debt
associated   with  the  growth  of  the  Company  both  internally  and  through
acquisitions.  As a percentage of homebuilding  revenues,  homebuilding interest
expense  was  0.7% in both  1998 and  1997.  The  Company  follows  a policy  of
capitalizing  interest  only on inventory  under  construction  or  development.
During both 1998 and 1997, the Company expensed the portion of incurred interest
and other financing  costs which could not be charged to inventory.  Capitalized
interest and other  financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of
home closings.


Year Ended September 30, 1997 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1996

     Revenues  from  homebuilding  activities  increased  by 37.9%  to  $1,567.5
million in 1997 from $1,136.3 million in 1996. The number of homes closed by the
Company  increased  by 31.2% to 10,038  homes in 1997 from  7,651 in 1996.  Home
closings  increased in all of the  Company's  market  regions,  with  percentage
increases  ranging from 120.2% in the Southeast  region to 8.3% in the Southwest
region.  The increases in both revenues and homes closed were due in part to the
February 1997 acquisition of Torrey.  From its acquisition through September 30,
1997, Torrey closed 962 homes, with revenues totalling $140.8 million. For 1997,
Torrey  accounted  for 9.6% of homes closed and 9.0% of the revenues  generated.
Excluding  Torrey,  1997 revenues  increased by 25.6% to $1,426.7  million.  The
average price of homes closed  increased  3.9% to $152,600 in 1997 from $146,900
in 1996 due to changes in the  geographic mix of homes closed within the Company
and different price points in certain markets.

     New net sales contracts  increased 25.1% to 10,551 homes in 1997 from 8,432
in 1996.  Percentage  increases in the dollar  value of new net sales  contracts
ranging from 110.2% to 7.4% were achieved in four of the  Company's  five market
regions,  with a 4.4%  decline  experienced  in the  Midwest  region.  From  its
acquisition  through  September 30, 1997,  Torrey's new net sales contracts were
$153.8  million  (1,049 homes).  Excluding  Torrey,  the Company's new net sales
contracts were $1,441.9  million (9,502 homes),  a 14.9% increase over 1996. The
average selling price of new sales contracts in 1997 was $151,200,  up 1.6% from
the 1996 average selling price of $148,800.

     The Company was  operating  in 377  subdivisions  at  September  30,  1997,
compared to 253 at September  30, 1996.  At September  30, 1997,  the  Company's
backlog of sales  contracts was $609.2 million  (3,961 homes),  a 20.8% increase
over the comparable  figure at September 30, 1996. At September 30, 1997, Torrey



held a sales contract  backlog of $61.8 million (413 homes).  Excluding  Torrey,
the Company's  sales contract  backlog at September 30, 1997, was $547.4 million
(3,548 homes),  up 8.5% from the prior year. The average sales price of homes in
backlog was $153,800 at September 30, 1997, down 0.2% from $154,100 at September
30, 1996.

     Cost of sales  increased  by 39.0% to $1,292.6  million in 1997 from $930.1
million in 1996.  The  increase  in cost of sales  accompanied  the  increase in
revenues.  Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  increased by 0.6% to 82.4%
in 1997 from 81.8% in 1996,  due to  competitive  pressures  causing lower gross
margins  in the Austin  and  California  markets  and the  effects  of  purchase
accounting  adjustments requiring the Company to increase its basis in inventory
acquired with Trimark, SGS and Torrey.

     Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding
activities  increased by 40.4% to $163.0  million in 1997 from $116.1 million in
1996. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expenses increased to 10.4%
in 1997 from 10.2% in 1996.  Absent the SG&A costs  associated with  integrating
the three 1997  acquisitions,  SG&A  expenses as a  percentage  of  homebuilding
revenues would have decreased by 0.2% to 10.0% in 1997.

     Interest expense associated with homebuilding activities increased to $10.2
million in 1997 from $7.5 million in 1996 due to the  corresponding  increase in
homebuilding  revenues. As a percentage of homebuilding  revenues,  homebuilding
interest expense was 0.7% in both 1997 and 1996. The Company follows a policy of
capitalizing  interest  only on inventory  under  construction  or  development.
During both 1997 and 1996, the Company expensed the portion of incurred interest
and other financing  costs which could not be charged to inventory.  Capitalized
interest and other  financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of
home closings.


Results of Operations -- Financial Services

     Financial  services include  mortgage  financing and title insurance agency
and closing services,  primarily related to purchases of homes built and sold by
the Company.  Mortgage  services are provided in  California,  Nevada,  Arizona,
Colorado,  Texas,  Florida,  Kentucky,  Minnesota and North and South  Carolina.
Title agency and closing services are provided in Texas,  Florida and Minnesota.
The following table summarizes financial and other information for the Company's
financial services operations:




Year Ended September 30, 1998 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1997

     Revenues  from  financial  services  operations  increased  99.6%  to $21.9
million in 1998 from $11.0 million in 1997.  The increase in financial  services
revenues  was due to the rapid  expansion  of the  Company's  title  agency  and
mortgage  loan  services  provided  to  the  Company's  homebuilding  customers.



Accordingly,  SG&A expenses  associated with financial services increased 74.6%,
to $15.2 million in 1998 from $8.7 million in 1997. As a percentage of financial
services revenues,  SG&A expenses decreased by 10.0% to 69.6% in 1998 from 79.6%
in 1997 due  primarily  to higher  than  normal  1997  startup  expenses  in new
markets.


Year Ended September 30, 1997 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 1996

     Revenues  from  financial  services  operations  decreased by 4.5% to $11.0
million in 1997 from $11.5  million  in 1996 due to a sale of  servicing  rights
that resulted in recognition of $0.9 million of revenues in 1996.  SG&A expenses
associated  with financial  services  increased by 24.3% to $8.7 million in 1997
from $7.0 million in 1996 due to startup expenses in new markets.  This increase
caused financial  services SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase
to 79.6% in 1997 from 61.2% in 1996.


Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

     At September 30, 1998, the Company had available cash and cash  equivalents
of  $76.8  million.  Inventories  (including  finished  homes,  construction  in
progress,  and developed  residential lots and other land) at September 30, 1998
had  increased by $333.8  million since  September  30, 1997,  partly due to the
acquisitions of the assets (primarily  inventories) of Dobson,  Mareli, and RMP.
Inventories  also increased due to a general  increase in business  activity and
the expansion of operations in all of the Company's  market areas.  Although the
inventory increase and the acquisitions of Dobson,  Mareli and RMP were financed
primarily  by borrowing  under the  revolving  credit  facility,  the  increased
borrowing  was  partially  offset by the conversion  of $27.5  million of 6 7/8%
convertible subordinated notes to common stock. As a result, the Company's ratio
of notes payable to total  capital at September 30, 1998 was 60.9%,  an increase
of only 0.6% over the September 30, 1997 level of 60.3%.

     During  fiscal  1998,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  declared  four
quarterly  cash  dividends  of $.0225  per  common  share,  the last of which is
payable on October 23, 1998, to stockholders of record on October 16, 1998.

     On April 20,  1998,  the  Company  closed its merger with  Continental.  In
accordance  with the  terms of the  merger  agreement,  a total of 15.5  million
shares  of  D.R.  Horton,  Inc.  common  stock  were  exchanged  for  all of the
Continental common stock  outstanding,  based upon an exchange ratio of 2.25. At
the time of the merger, the Company assumed Continental's  existing public debt,
consisting  of $150  million  in 10% senior  notes due April 15,  2006 and $86.1
million  (convertible  into 8.2 million shares of Horton common stock) in 6 7/8%
convertible  subordinated  notes due November 1, 2002. Of the convertible notes,
$27.5 million have been  converted to common stock as of September 30, 1998, and
the remainder were converted in October 1998.

     At September 30, 1998, the Company had outstanding  debt of $854.5 million,
of which $455.0 million represented advances under the bank credit facility.  On
April 21, 1998, the Company increased and restructured its unsecured bank credit
facility to $825 million  consisting of a $775 million four-year  revolving loan
and a $50 million  four-year letter of credit  facility.  At September 30, 1998,
under the debt covenants  associated with the restructured bank credit facility,
the Company had additional  borrowing  capacity of $364.5  million.  Because the
bank  credit  facility  has a  floating  rate,  the  Company  has  entered  into
multi-year fixed interest swap agreements with notional amounts aggregating $300
million.

     The mortgage  company has a $75 million,  one-year  maturity bank warehouse
facility that is secured by mortgage loans held for sale. The warehouse facility
is not guaranteed by the parent company. As of September 30, 1998, $28.5 million
had been drawn under this facility,  with additional financing needs provided by
the  Company.  In the  future,  it is  anticipated  that  all  mortgage  company
activities will be financed under the warehouse facility.

     In February  1998,  the Company  completed  the  acquisition  of all of the
outstanding stock of Dobson,  and certain of its affiliated  companies for $23.4
million. Dobson's assets, primarily inventories, amounted to approximately $64.3
million.  Total  liabilities  assumed amounted to  approximately  $52.4 million,
including notes payable of $49.3 million, which were paid at closing. In May and
June 1998,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of the  principal  assets



(approximately $16.9 million,  primarily  inventories) of Mareli, of Louisville,
Kentucky, and RMP, of Portland,  Oregon, for $8.1 million in cash, 70,249 shares
of  Horton  common  stock  valued  at  $1.1  million,   and  the  assumption  of
approximately  $16.0 million in trade accounts and notes payable associated with
the acquired assets.  Mareli's and RMP's  liabilities  included $13.3 million in
notes payable which were paid at closing.  These acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method and funded through available lines of credit.

     The Company's rapid growth and acquisition  strategies require  significant
amounts of cash. It is anticipated that future home  construction,  lot and land
purchases and acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds and
new and existing  credit  facilities.  The Company  maintains a universal  shelf
registration  statement with a capacity of $400 million.  Additionally,  a shelf
registration  has been filed for 10 million  shares of common stock  issuable to
effect,  in whole or in part,  possible future  acquisitions.  Market conditions
will  determine  when and whether the Company will issue  additional  securities
using the shelf registration statements.  The Company continuously evaluates its
capital  structure and, in the future,  may seek to further  increase  unsecured
debt and  obtain  additional  equity to fund  ongoing  operations  as well as to
pursue additional growth opportunities.

     At  September  30,  1998,   except  for  ordinary   expenditures   for  the
construction  of homes and the  acquisition of land and lots for development and
sale of homes, the Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures.


Inflation

     The Company and the  homebuilding  industry  in general,  may be  adversely
affected during periods of high inflation,  primarily because of higher land and
construction costs. Inflation also increases the Company's financing,  labor and
material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect
the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. The
Company  attempts to pass through to its  customers  any  increases in its costs
through  increased  sales prices and, to date,  inflation has not had a material
adverse  effect on the Company's  results of  operations.  However,  there is no
assurance  that  inflation  will  not  have a  material  adverse  impact  on the
Company's future results of operations.


Year 2000

     The "Year 2000" issue (Y2K) refers to potential  complications  that may be
caused by computer  hardware and software  that were not designed for the change
in the century. If not corrected,  such computer hardware and software may cause
management information systems to fail or miscalculate data.

     The Company has assessed  (and  continues to assess) its  vulnerability  to
Y2K,  particularly in light of its merger with  Continental.  Modifications  and
replacements  of computer  hardware and software to prepare for Y2K are ongoing.
The Company has  assessed  and tested its  principal  homebuilding  hardware and
management information system used in homebuilding  operations and believes them
to be Y2K  compliant.  Evaluation,  modification  and  testing of  non-principal
hardware and management information systems used in homebuilding  operations are
in process  and such  systems  are  expected to be  converted  to the  principal
management  information system or Y2K modifications are expected to be completed
by June, 1999, at a cost of less than one million dollars.

     Management   information  systems  for  the  Company's  financial  services
activities also are being evaluated and will require  modifications  or upgraded
software  packages  that are expected to be completed by June,  1999, at minimal
costs.

     As part of a program on continuous technology updates, for the past several
years,  the Company has upgraded  personal  computers in its  locations and this
process will continue.  As this occurs during 1999,  personal  computers at each
company  location will be tested for Y2K  compliance.  These  personal  computer
upgrades are considered to be ongoing and are not considered to be  specifically
Y2K  related.  The  Company  expects to incur  costs to  replace or repair  such
equipment, but has not presently determined the amount of these costs.



     The Company is presently  evaluating other potential Y2K issues,  including
non-management information systems. A Y2K coordinator is directing the Company's
overall effort to address these issues. As part of these reviews,  the Company's
relationships with payroll service providers,  vendors,  contractors,  financial
institutions  and other third  parties will be reviewed to determine the impact,
if any, Y2K will have on these relationships.

     The Company expects to incur Y2K specific costs in the future, but does not
anticipate  that these costs will be material.  It is possible  that the Company
could encounter  disruptions to its business that could have a material  adverse
effect on its results of operations if all systems are not Y2K compliant.  Also,
the Company  could be materially  impacted by  widespread  economic or financial
market disruptions or by Y2K computer system failures at government  agencies on
which the Company is  dependent  for  utilities,  zoning,  building  permits and
related  matters.  There can be no assurance that Y2K will not adversely  affect
the Company and its operations.

     A formal Y2K internal  contingency  plan has not been prepared at this time
due to the variety of alternatives available to the Company.  Specifically,  the
Company is presently  evaluating a new  management  information  system that, if
necessary,  could  potentially be installed by the end of 1999, or non-principal
homebuilding  management information systems could be converted to the principal
homebuilding system before Y2K compliance became an issue.


Market Risk

     The  Company is subject to  interest  rate risk on its long term debt.  The
Company  manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use
of variable and fixed rate debt. In addition, the Company hedges its exposure to
changes  in  interest  rates on its  variable  rate bank debt by  entering  into
interest rate swap  agreements to lock in a fixed interest rate for a portion of
these borrowings.

     The following  table sets forth,  as of September  30, 1998,  the Company's
long term debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted
average  interest rates and estimated fair market value. In addition,  the table
sets forth the  notional  amounts and  weighted  average  interest  rates of the
Company's interest rate swaps.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors
D.R. Horton, Inc.

     We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of D.R.
Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period  ended  September  30,  1998.  These  financial
statements are the  responsibility  of the management of D.R.  Horton,  Inc. and
subsidiaries.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the 1996 financial  statements
of Continental  Homes Holding Corp.  ("Continental")  which  statements  reflect
total  revenues  constituting  52% of the  related  consolidated  totals.  Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
and our  opinion,  insofar as it relates to data  included for  Continental,  is
based solely on the report of the other auditors.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and  disclosures  in financial  statements.  An audit also  includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

     In our  opinion,  based on our audits  and,  for 1996,  the report of other
auditors,  the financial  statements  referred to above present  fairly,  in all
material respects,  the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
subsidiaries,  at September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the  consolidated  results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  September 30, 1998,  in conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

              NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Business:  D.R.  Horton,  Inc. (the Company) is a national  builder that is
engaged  primarily in the construction  and sale of single-family  housing in 41
markets  and 23 states in the United  States.  The Company  designs,  builds and
sells single-family houses on lots developed by the Company and on finished lots
which it purchases, ready for home construction. Periodically, the Company sells
lots it has  developed.  The Company  also  provides  title  agency and mortgage
brokerage services to its homebuyers. The Company does not retain or service the
mortgages  that it  originates  but,  rather  sells the  mortgages  and  related
servicing rights to investors.

     Merger:  On April 20, 1998, the Company and Continental Homes Holding Corp.
(Continental) consummated a merger pursuant to which Continental was merged into
the Company,  with 2.25 shares of the Company  common shares  exchanged for each
outstanding share of Continental.  Approximately 15,459,500 Horton common shares
were issued to effect the merger.  The merger with  Continental was treated as a
pooling of interests for accounting purposes.  Therefore,  all financial amounts
have been presented as if  Continental  and the Company had been combined at the
earliest period presented.

     Prior  to the  merger,  Continental  had a fiscal  year end of May 31,  and
accordingly, the Continental statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the year  ended May 31,  1996 have been  combined  with the  Company's
statements  of income,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for the fiscal year
ended  September  30, 1996.  Continental's  1997  balance  sheet and the related
statements of income and cash flows have been conformed to the Company's  fiscal
year end of September 30, 1997.

     As permitted by  regulations  of the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission,
Continental's operations for the four-month period ended September 30, 1996 have
been  omitted  from the  statements  of income,  and cash  flows.  Continental's
revenues,  cost of sales, income before taxes and net income for this four month
period were $234.4  million,  $191.6  million,  $18.8 million and $11.2 million,
respectively.

     The results of operations for the separate  companies  prior to combination
and the combined amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements are:





                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial statements include
the  accounts  of the Company and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     Accounting   Principles:   The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

     Statements  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards:  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 131 "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related  Information",  issued in June 1997,  establishes annual and interim
reporting  requirements  for an  enterprise's  operating  segments  and  related
disclosures  about its products  and  services,  geographical  areas in which it
operates and major  customers.  SFAS 131 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997, with earlier  application  permitted.  Adoption of SFAS
131 is not expected to materially impact the Company.

     In June 1998,  SFAS No. 133,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging Activities,  was issued with adoption required in fiscal year 2000, when
the Company plans to adopt the Statement.  At the time of adoption,  the Company
must  recognize  all  derivatives  on the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  with
adjustments  recorded through income in certain situations.  The Company has not
yet determined what the effect of SFAS 133 will be on earnings and the financial
position of the Company at the time of adoption.

     Cash: The Company  considers all highly liquid  investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  Amounts
in transit from title companies for home closings are included in cash.

     Cost of  Sales:  Cost of sales  includes  home  warranty  costs,  purchased
discounts for customer financing, and sales commissions paid to third parties.

     Excess of Cost Over Net Assets  Acquired:  The  excess of amounts  paid for
business  acquisitions  over  the net  fair  value of the  assets  acquired  and
liabilities  assumed is amortized  using the  straight-line  method over periods
ranging  from  five to  twenty  five  years.  Additional  consideration  paid in
subsequent  periods  under the terms of  purchase  agreements  are  included  as
acquisition  costs.   Amortization   expense  was  $1,589,000,   $2,296,000  and
$3,427,000 in fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization
was $9,545,000 and $11,635,000 at September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     Interest.   The  Company   capitalizes   interest  during  development  and
construction.  Capitalized  interest  is charged to cost of sales as the related
inventory is delivered to the home buyer. Interest costs are (in thousands):





                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     Inventories:  Finished  inventories  are stated at the lower of accumulated
cost or fair value less costs to sell. Inventories under development or held for
development  are stated at  accumulated  costs,  unless  such costs would not be
recovered from the cash flows generated by future disposition. In this instance,
such inventories are measured at fair value, less costs of disposal.

     Sold  units are  expensed  on a  specific  identification  basis as cost of
sales. Included in inventories are related interest and property taxes which are
capitalized  in  inventory  during the  development  and  construction  periods.
Residential  lots are  transferred  to  construction  in progress  when building
permits are requested.  Land and  development  costs are allocated to individual
lots on a prorata basis.

     Earnings  Per Share:  The Company  adopted SFAS 128,  "Earnings  Per Share"
during  fiscal 1998 and restated  earnings per share  amounts for all periods in
conformity with the Statement.

     Basic  earnings  per share is based  upon the  weighted  average  number of
shares of common stock outstanding during each year.

     Diluted  earnings  per share is based upon the weighted  average  number of
shares of common stock outstanding during each year, adjusted for the effects of
dilutive securities.

     The  following  table  sets  forth the  computation  of basic  and  diluted
earnings per share (in thousands):



     Minority  Interest:  The Company has a joint venture  arrangement on a land
project  whereby the Company is entitled to 55% of the profits and/or losses and
is the managing partner. The financial position and results of operations of the
joint  venture  are  consolidated  for  financial  statement  purposes  and  the
partners' equity position is disclosed as a minority interest.

     Property  and  Equipment:  Property  and  equipment,  including  model home
furniture,  are stated on the basis of cost. Major renewals and improvements are
capitalized.  Repairs and  maintenance  are expensed as  incurred.  Depreciation
generally is provided using the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful
life of the asset.  Accumulated  depreciation was $12,847,000 and $18,944,000 as
of September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively.



                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     Reclassifications:  Certain  financial  statement  amounts in 1996 and 1997
have been reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation.

     Revenue  Recognition:  Revenue  generally is  recognized at the time of the
closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property  transfer to the
buyer.

     Mortgage loans:  Mortgage loans held for sale are reported net of discounts
and are  stated  at the  lower of cost or market  on an  aggregate  basis  which
approximates the fair value. Any gain or loss on the sale of loans is recognized
at  the  time  of  sale.  Loan  origination  fees,  net of  the  related  direct
origination  costs,  are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying  value of the
related  mortgage loans held for sale and are recognized in income upon the sale
of the mortgage loans.


NOTE B -- NOTES PAYABLE

     In June, 1998, the Company filed a universal shelf  registration  statement
with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  for up to $400  million  of the
Company's debt and equity securities.  The universal shelf registration provides
that  securities  may be offered  from time to time in one or more series and in
the form of senior,  senior  subordinated or subordinated debt,  preferred stock
and/or common stock.


Homebuilding:

     The Company has a $825 million  unsecured  revolving  bank credit  facility
maturing in April,  2002,  of which $50  million is reserved  for use as standby
letters of credit. The revolving credit facility was increased from $625 million
during 1998. Borrowings bear daily interest at rates based upon federal funds or
the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon the Company's
ratio of debt to tangible net worth.  In addition to the stated  interest rates,
the revolving  credit  facility  requires the Company to pay certain  fees.  The
weighted average interest rates of the unsecured bank debt at September 30, 1997
and 1998 were 7.2% and 6.2%, respectively.

     In April 1996,  the Company  issued  $130,000,000  principal  amount of 10%
Senior  Notes due  April 15,  2006.  In  January  1997,  the  Company  issued an
additional  $20,000,000  principal  amount of its 10% Senior Notes due April 15,
2006. The 10% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole
or in  part,  at any  time on or  after  April  15,  2001 at  redemption  prices
decreasing from 105%.

     In June,  1997 the Company  issued $150 million of 8 3/8% Senior  Unsecured
Notes.  The 8 3/8% Senior  Notes,  which are due June 15,  2004,  with  interest
payable  semi-annually,  represent unsecured  obligations of the Company.  The 8
3/8% Senior Notes are not  redeemable  except that 35% of the amount  originally
issued can be redeemed with proceeds of a public equity  offering by the Company
at a redemption price of 108.375% through June 15, 2000.

     Both series of the Senior Notes are senior  obligations  of the Company and
rank  pari  passu in right of  payment  to all  existing  and  future  unsecured
indebtedness  of the Company.  These Notes are guaranteed by the majority of the
Company subsidiaries.  Upon a change of control of the Company,  holders of both
the 8 3/8% and 10% Senior  Notes have the right to require the Company to redeem
the Senior  Notes at a price of 101% of the par amount,  along with  accrued and
unpaid interest.

     The  bank  credit  facilities  and  the  Senior  Notes  indentures  contain
covenants  which,  taken  together,   limit  investments  in  inventory,   stock
repurchases,  cash  dividends  and  other  restricted  payments,  incurrence  of
indebtedness,  asset  dispositions  and creation of liens,  and require  certain
levels of tangible net worth.  At September 30, 1998,  these covenants limit the
additional debt the Company could incur to $364.5 million.



                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     The Company is required to comply with certain  covenants  contained in its
bank agreements and its Senior Notes  indentures.  The most restrictive of these
requirements  allows the Company to pay cash dividends on its common stock in an
amount not to exceed,  on a cumulative basis, 50% of consolidated net income, as
defined, subject to certain other adjustments.  Pursuant to the most restrictive
of these requirements, the Company had approximately $65.6 million available for
the payment of dividends  and for the  acquisition  by the Company of its common
stock at September 30, 1998.

     The Company uses interest rate swap  agreements to help manage a portion of
its interest rate  exposure.  The agreements  convert a notional  amount of $300
million from a variable rate to a fixed rate.  $200 million of these  agreements
are  cancellable  by a third party during  periods  where LIBOR  exceeds 7%. The
agreements expire at dates through September,  2008. The Company does not expect
non-performance by the counterparty,  a major U.S. bank, and any losses incurred
in the  event of  non-performance  would not be  expected  to be  material.  Net
payments or receipts  under the  Company's  interest  rate swap  agreements  are
recorded as adjustments to interest  incurred.  As a result of these agreements,
the Company  incurred  additional  net  interest  cost of $0.7  million and $0.3
million during 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     In November and December  1995, the Company  issued  $86,250,000  principal
amount of 6 7/8% Convertible Subordinated  Notes due November 1, 2002. The Notes
are  convertible  at a rate of  94.73625  shares  of  Common  Stock  per  $1,000
principal  amount  of  Notes  at any  time  prior to  maturity.  The  Notes  are
redeemable  in whole or in part at the  option of the  Company at any time on or
after November 1, 1998, at redemption prices decreasing from 103.438%. The Notes
are subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the Company.  During fiscal 1998,
conversions of these securities for common stock reduced the amount  outstanding
at  September  30, 1998 to $58.8  million.  Subsequent  to  September  30, 1998,
essentially  all the  principal  amount of these  notes  were  converted  by the
holders to 5.6 million shares of common stock.

     Maturities of notes payable,  excluding the  convertible  debt and assuming
the revolving  bank facility is not  extended,  are $16.1 million in 1999,  $0.6
million in 2000,  $455.2  million  in 2002,  $0.4  million  in 2003,  and $294.9
million thereafter.


Financial Services:

     The Company has a $75 million mortgage  warehouse line payable to financial
institutions,  secured by mortgage loans held for sale,  maturing August 1999 at
LIBOR + 1%. These notes payable enable the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CH
Mortgage  Company  I, Ltd.,  to perform  its loan  origination  and  warehousing
functions.

NOTE C -- ACQUISITIONS

     In fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company made the following acquisitions:



     Consideration  includes cash paid,  Company stock issued, and assumption of
certain accounts payable and notes payable,  which were repaid subsequent to the
acquisitions.

     Except for the Torrey  Group and Dobson  Builders,  the above  acquisitions
contain  provisions for additional  consideration  to be paid annually for up to
four years subsequent to the acquisition  date. The additional  consideration is
based upon subsequent pretax income,  adjusted for a preferential  return to the
Company.  Such additional  consideration will be recorded when paid as excess of
cost over net assets acquired, which is amortized using the straight line method
over a period  ranging  from 5 to 25 years.  All of the acquired  companies  are
involved in  homebuilding  and land  development.  The Company has accounted for
these  acquisitions under the purchase method and has included the operations of
the acquired  businesses  in its  Consolidated  Statements of Income since their
acquisition.

     The following  unaudited pro forma  summaries of combined  operations  were
prepared  to  illustrate  the  estimated  effects  of the 1997  acquisitions  of
Trimark, SGS and Torrey as if such acquisitions had occurred on the first day of
the  respective   periods   presented.   Pro  forma  information  for  the  1998
acquisitions  of Dobson,  Mareli  and RMP is not  significantly  different  from
historical  results and is not presented.  The pro forma  information  should be
read in conjunction with the historical  financial statements and notes thereto.
The pro forma financial  information is provided for  comparative  purposes only
and is not necessarily  indicative of the results which would have been obtained
if the  acquisitions  had been  effected  throughout  the period.  The pro forma
financial information is based upon the purchase method of accounting.

NOTE D -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     On April 22,  1996,  the Board of  Directors  declared  an 8% common  stock
dividend.   Since  this  stock  dividend  occurred  prior  to  the  merger  with
Continental,  only D.R. Horton, Inc. stockholders at the time of the transaction
participated in it.

     In June 1998,  the Company filed a shelf  registration  statement  with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to issue, from time to time, up to 10 million
shares of registered common stock in connection with future acquisitions.

     Subsequent to year end, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to  $100  million  each  of  the  Company's  common  stock  and  senior  debt
securities, as market conditions warrant.


NOTE E -- PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes  and the  amounts  used for  income  tax  purposes.  These  differences
primarily  relate to the  capitalization  of  inventory  costs,  the  accrual of
warranty  costs,  and  depreciation.  The  Company's  deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities are not significant.

     The difference  between income tax expense and tax computed by applying the
federal statutory income tax rate to income before taxes is due primarily to the
effect  of  applicable  state  income  taxes  (4% to 6%) and,  in 1998,  certain
non-deductible merger costs (1%).

     Income tax expense from continuing operations was:




NOTE F -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     The Company has 401(k)  plans for Company  employees.  The Company  matches
portions   of   employees'   voluntary   contributions.    Additional   employer
contributions  in the  form  of  profit  sharing  are at the  discretion  of the
Company. Expenses for these Plans were $1,023,000, $1,200,000 and $1,977,000 for
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.



                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     The  Company's   Supplemental   Executive  Retirement  Plans  (SERP's)  are
non-qualified  deferred  compensation  programs that provide benefits payable to
certain  management   employees  upon  retirement,   death,  or  termination  of
employment  with the Company.  Under one SERP,  the Company  accrues an unfunded
benefit, as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined  formula.  The
Company  recorded  $313,000,  $543,000  and $573,000 of expense for this plan in
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted the D.R. Horton,  Inc. Stock
Tenure  Plan (an  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan),  covering  those  employees
generally  not  participating  in  the  stock  option  or  SERP  benefit  plans.
Contributions  are made at the  discretion of the Company.  Expenses  related to
Company  contributions  of common  stock to the Plan of  $229,000,  $309,000 and
$999,000 were recognized for 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     The Company Stock Incentive Plans provide for the granting of stock options
to certain key  employees  of the Company to  purchase  shares of common  stock.
Options are granted at exercise prices which approximate the market value of the
Company's  common stock at the date of the grant.  Options  generally  expire 10
years after the dates on which they were granted. Options vest over periods of 3
to 10 years.  There were 264,007 and 635,848 shares  available for future grants
under the Plans at September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     Activity under the plan is:



     Exercise prices for options  outstanding at September 30, 1998, ranged from
$1.804 to $22.6875.



                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     The weighted average remaining contractual lives of those options are:



     The Company has elected to follow  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25, in accounting  for its employee  stock  options.  The exercise  price of the
Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, and therefore no compensation expense is recognized.  SFAS
No. 123 requires  disclosure  of pro forma income and pro forma income per share
as if the fair value based  method had been  applied in  measuring  compensation
expense for option  awards  granted in fiscal  1996,  1997 and 1998.  Management
believes  the  fiscal  1996,  1997  and  1998  pro  forma  amounts  may  not  be
representative  of the  effects of option  awards on future pro forma net income
and pro forma net income per share because  options  granted before 1996 are not
considered  in these  calculations.  Application  of the fair value  method,  as
specified by SFAS 123, would decrease net income by $118,000  ($0.01 per diluted
share),  $398,000  ($0.01 per  diluted  share) and  $815,000  ($0.01 per diluted
share) in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

     The weighted average fair value of grants made in 1998 was $10.09.

     The fair values of the options  granted were estimated on the date of their
grant  using the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  based on the  following
weighted average assumptions:



NOTE G -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The fair values of the Company's financial  instruments are based on quoted
market prices, where available, or are estimated.  Fair value estimates are made
at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information
about the  financial  instrument.  These  estimates  are  subjective  in nature,
involve matters of judgment and therefore,  cannot be determined with precision.
Estimated fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used.



                       D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     The table below sets for the carrying  values and estimated  fair values of
the Company's financial instruments (in thousands).



     The Company used the following  methods and  assumptions in estimating fair
values:

     For cash and cash equivalents,  the revolving credit facility,  other notes
payable,  and standby  letters of credit the  carrying  amounts  reported in the
balance sheet  approximate  fair values due to their short  maturity or floating
interest rate terms, as applicable.

     For senior notes,  convertible  subordinated notes, mortgage loans held for
sale,  interest rate swaps and mortgage  loans held for sale, the fair values of
these  financial  instruments  are  estimated  based on quoted market prices for
similar financial instruments.


NOTE H -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company is involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the ordinary
course of business.  Management believes that, while the ultimate outcome of the
contingencies  cannot be predicted with certainty,  the ultimate  liability,  if
any,  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Company's  financial
position.

     In the  ordinary  course  of  business,  the  Company  enters  into  option
agreements  to purchase land and  developed  lots.  At September 30, 1998,  cash
deposits of approximately  $16.4 million and promissory notes approximating $2.3
million secured the Company's performance under these agreements.

     Additionally,  in the normal course of its business activities, the Company
provides  standby  letters  of credit  and  performance  bonds,  issued by third
parties,  to secure performance under various contracts.  At September 30, 1998,
outstanding  standby letters of credit were $19.8 million and performance  bonds
were $140.1 million. The Company has an additional capacity of $30.2 million for
standby letters of credit under its revolving credit facility.

     The Company  leases  office  space under  noncancelable  operating  leases.
Minimum  annual  lease  payments  under  these  leases  at  September  30,  1998
approximate:


     Rent expense approximated  $2,594,000,  $3,177,000 and $4,674,000 for 1996,
1997 and 1998, respectively.


NOTE I -- SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

                              CORPORATE INFORMATION

     D.R. Horton,  Inc. (the "Company") is engaged primarily in the construction
and sale of  single-family  homes.  The Company offers  high-quality  homes with
custom features, designed principally for the entry-level and move-up segments.

     Horton  has  established  a unique  marketing  niche,  offering  a  broader
selection  of homes  that  typically  have more  amenities  and  greater  design
flexibility than homes offered by volume builders,  at prices that are generally
more affordable than those charged by local custom builders.  Horton homes range
in size from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet and are priced from $80,000 to $600,000.
For the year ended  September 30, 1998,  the Company closed 13,944 homes with an
average sales price of approximately $153,300.

     The Company is  geographically  diversified,  operating in 23 states and 41
markets. Plans call for continued expansion in current markets, as well as entry
into new markets that have  significant  entry-level and move-up market segments
consistent with the Company's product and pricing strategy.
