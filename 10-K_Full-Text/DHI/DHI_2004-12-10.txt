PART 1

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is a national homebuilder. We
construct and sell high quality single-family homes, designed
principally for first-time and move-up homebuyers, through our
operating divisions in 21 states and 63 metropolitan
markets of the United States, primarily under the name of D.R.
Horton,

America’s Builder.

D.R. Horton, Inc. is
a Fortune 500 company listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the context
otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the
“Company,” “we” and “our” used
herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business
in 1978. In 1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire
the assets and businesses of our predecessor companies, which
were residential home construction and development companies
owned or controlled by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed
our initial public offering of our common stock. From inception,
we have consistently grown the size of our company by investing
our available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and
into start-up operations in new markets. Additionally, from July
1993 to February 2002, we acquired 17 other homebuilding
companies, which strengthened our market position in existing
markets and expanded our geographic presence and product
offerings in other markets. We are now the largest homebuilding
company in the United States, based on domestic homebuilding
revenues, homes sold and homes closed during the year ended
September 30, 2004. Our homes generally range in size from
1,000 to 5,000 square feet and range in price from $80,000
to $900,000. For the year ended September 30, 2004, we
closed 43,567 homes with an average closing sales price
approximating $240,800.

Through our financial services operations, we
provide mortgage banking and title agency services to homebuyers
in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly
owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services,
principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell. Our
subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by
providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
services, primarily to purchasers of homes we build and sell.

Our financial reporting segments consist of
homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations
are a substantial part of our business, comprising approximately
98% of consolidated revenues and approximately 95% of
consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal year 2004. Our
homebuilding segment generates the majority of its revenues from
the sale of completed homes with a lesser amount from the sale
of land and lots. In addition to building traditional single
family detached homes, the homebuilding segment also builds
attached homes, such as town homes, condominiums, duplexes, and
triplexes, which share common walls and roofs. Approximately
84%, 91%, and 92% of home sales revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, were generated from the sale of detached
homes. Our financial services segment generates its revenues
from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for
title insurance and closing services. Financial information,
including revenue, pre-tax income and identifiable assets, for
both of our reporting segments is included in our consolidated
financial statements.

We make available, as soon as reasonably
practicable, on our Internet website all of our reports required
to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These
reports include our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K,
changes in beneficial ownership reports on Forms 3, 4,
and 5, proxy statements and amendments to such reports. These
reports may be accessed by going to our website at
www.drhorton.com and clicking on the “Investor
Relations” link. We will also provide these reports in
electronic or paper format to our stockholders free of charge
upon request made to our Investor Relations department.
Information on our Internet website is not part of this annual
report on Form 10-K.

Our principal executive offices are located at
301 Commerce Street, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. Our telephone
number is (817) 390-8200, and our Internet website address

Operating Strategy

We believe that the following operating
strategies have enabled us to achieve consistent growth and
profitability:

Geographic Diversity

From 1978 to late 1987, our homebuilding
activities were conducted in the Dallas/ Fort Worth area.
We then began diversifying geographically by entering additional
markets, both through startup operations and acquisitions.

We believe our diversification strategy mitigates
the effects of local and regional economic cycles and enhances
our growth potential. Typically, we do not invest material
amounts of capital in real estate, including raw land, developed
lots, models and speculative homes, or overhead in start-up
operations in new markets, until such markets demonstrate
significant growth potential and acceptance of our products.
While we believe there are significant growth opportunities in
our existing markets, we also intend to continue our
diversification strategy by seeking to enter new markets. We
continually monitor the sales, margins and returns achieved in
each of our markets as part of our evaluation of the use of our
capital.

Decentralized Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to
give more operating flexibility to our local division
presidents. We have 42 separate operating divisions, some of
which are in the same market area and some of which operate in
more than one market area. Generally, each operating division
consists of a division president, land acquisition and
development personnel, a sales manager and sales personnel, a
construction manager and construction superintendents, a
controller, a purchasing manager and office staff. We believe
that division presidents and their management teams, who are
intimately familiar with local conditions, make better decisions
regarding local operations. Our division presidents receive
performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial
measures in their operating divisions.

Operating Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other
governmental requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of
offsite work required to meet local building codes;

Centralized Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our
homebuilding business through our regional and corporate
offices. We have six separate homebuilding operating regions,
each of which generally consists of a region



president, legal counsel, a chief financial
officer and a purchasing manager. Each of our region presidents
and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the
operations of four to ten divisions, including review and
approval of division business plans and budgets, review and
approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts, allocation
of capital, oversight of inventory levels, and review of major
personnel decisions and division president compensation plans.

Our corporate office departments are responsible
for establishing our operational policies and internal control
standards and monitoring compliance with established policies
and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office
also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain
key risk elements and initiatives through the following
centralized functions:

Cost Management

We control our overhead costs by centralizing
certain administrative and accounting functions and by closely
monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management
positions in our operating divisions and our corporate office.
We also minimize advertising costs by actively participating in
promotional activities sponsored by local real estate brokers
and trade associations.

We control construction costs by striving to
efficiently design our homes, by obtaining competitive bids for
construction materials and labor and by negotiating favorable
pricing from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on
the volume of services and products we purchase from them on a
local, regional and national basis. We monitor our construction
costs on each house through our purchasing and construction
budgeting systems, and we monitor our inventory levels, margins,
returns and expenses through our management information systems.

Acquisitions

We have recently focused on internal growth.
However, as an integral component of our operational strategy,
we continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic
acquisitions. We believe that expanding our operations through
the acquisition of existing homebuilding companies affords us
several benefits not found in start-up operations. Such benefits
include:

•

Established land positions and inventories;

•

Existing relationships with land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers; and

•

Proven product acceptance by homebuyers and local
    brand name recognition in new markets.



In evaluating potential acquisition candidates,
we seek homebuilding companies that have excellent reputations,
track records of profitability and strong management teams. We
limit the risks associated with acquiring a going concern by
conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due
diligence on each acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding
companies that we believe will have a positive impact on our
earnings within one year. We believe that our acquisition
evaluation and due diligence processes and our decentralized
operating approach with centralized controls have contributed to
the successful integration of our prior acquisitions. In the
future, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition
opportunities that satisfy our acquisition criteria in existing
or new markets.

Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in all of
the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we
conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these
markets as indicated in the following table:



When evaluating the viability of new or existing
homebuilding markets, we consider the following factors, among
others:

Our homebuilding revenues from home sales by
geographic region are:

Our homebuilding revenues from land and lot sales
by geographic region are:

The majority of our homebuilding inventories are
concentrated in six states: Arizona, California, Colorado,
Florida, Nevada and Texas.

Land Policies

Typically, we acquire land only after we have
completed appropriate due diligence and after we have obtained
the rights (“entitlements”) to begin development or
construction work. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we
will, among other things, complete a feasibility study, which
includes soil tests, independent environmental studies and other
engineering work, and determine that all necessary zoning and
other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
property for home construction have been obtained. Although we
purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding
activities, occasionally we sell lots and land to other
developers and homebuilders.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in
which we purchase the right, but generally not the obligation,
to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined
schedule commensurate with



anticipated home closings or planned land
development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse,
which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money
deposited with land and lot sellers. This enables us to control
significant land and lot positions with minimal capital
investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated
with land ownership and development.

We limit our exposure to real estate inventory
risks by:

Construction

Our home designs are prepared by architects in
each of our markets to appeal to local tastes and preferences of
homebuyers in each community. We also offer optional interior
and exterior features to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic
home design and to allow us to generate additional revenues from
each home sold.

Substantially all of our construction work is
performed by subcontractors. Our construction supervisors
monitor the construction of each home, participate in important
design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of
subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors
for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning
and building codes. Subcontractors typically are retained for a
specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
subcontractor to complete construction at a fixed price.
Agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers generally are
negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with other
homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials and
lots in the markets where we operate.

Construction time for our homes depends on the
weather, availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of
the home, and other factors. We typically complete the
construction of a home within four to six months.

We do not maintain significant inventories of
construction materials, except for work in progress materials
for homes under construction. Typically, the construction
materials used in our operations are readily available from
numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
have not experienced any significant delays in construction due
to shortages of materials or labor.

Marketing and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned
employees and independent real estate brokers. We typically
conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model
homes in each subdivision. We generally do not offer our model
homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales
personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with
floor plans, price information, tours of model homes and the
selection of options and other custom features. We train and
inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing,
construction schedules, and marketing and advertising plans.



We advertise in our local markets as necessary.
We advertise in newspapers and trade publications (i.e. real
estate broker, mortgage company and utility publications), as
well as with marketing brochures and newsletters. We also use
billboards, radio and television advertising and our Internet
website to market the location, price range and availability of
our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we also attempt to
operate in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us
to take advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe
that model homes play a significant role in our marketing
efforts, so we expend significant effort to create an attractive
atmosphere in our model homes.

In addition to using model homes, we typically
build a limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision
to enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective
homebuyers who are relocating to our markets and to independent
brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed
home within 60 days. We sell a majority of these
speculative homes while they are under construction or
immediately following completion. We determine the number of
speculative homes to build in each market based on local market
factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations,
housing demand, seasonality and our past experience in the
market.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money
deposit of at least $500. The amount of earnest money required
varies between markets and subdivisions, and may significantly
exceed $500. Additionally, customers are generally required to
pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade
features for their homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate
that when customers cancel their contracts with us, we have the
right to retain their earnest money and option deposits;
however, our operating divisions occasionally choose to refund
such deposits. Our sales contracts also include a financing
contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a
refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage
financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a
specified period, and our contracts may include other
contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. Generally,
the length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a
home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is
three to six months.

Customer Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for
pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to
customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that prompt and
courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after
construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our
reputation for quality and service, and ultimately leads to
significant repeat and referral business from the real estate
community and homebuyers. We provide our homebuyers with a
limited one-year warranty on workmanship and building materials.
The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction
also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally
prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon
request. In addition, we provide a supplemental ten-year limited
warranty that covers major construction defects.

Customer Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services
principally to purchasers of homes we build and sell in the
majority of our homebuilding markets through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage coordinates and expedites
the entire sales transaction for both our homebuyers and our
homebuilding operations by ensuring that mortgage commitments
are received and that closings take place on a timely and
efficient basis. During the year ended September 30, 2004,
92% of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed
by our homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage provided
mortgage financing services for approximately 61% of our total
homes closed.

DHI Mortgage originates mortgage loans, and then
packages and sells substantially all of the loans and their
servicing rights to third-party investors shortly after
origination on a non-recourse or limited recourse basis. In
markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing, we
work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to
homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs.



Title Services

We serve as a title insurance agent in selected
markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and
closing services to purchasers of homes we build and sell,
through our subsidiary title companies. We assume little or no
underwriting risk associated with these title policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2004, we employed 7,466
persons, of whom 1,420 were sales and marketing personnel, 2,571
were executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 2,170
were involved in construction, and 1,305 worked in mortgage and
title operations. The Company had fewer than 20 employees
covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees of some
of the subcontractors which we use are represented by labor
unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We
believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors
are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive.
We compete in each of our markets with numerous other national,
regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable
properties, raw materials, skilled labor and financing. Our
homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design, mortgage
financing terms and location.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental
Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive
and complex regulations. We and our subcontractors must comply
with various federal, state and local laws and regulations,
including zoning, density and development requirements,
building, environmental, advertising and real estate sales rules
and regulations. These requirements affect the development
process, as well as building materials to be used, building
designs and minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are
inspected by local authorities where required, and homes
eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA
are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often
provide broad discretion to the administering governmental
authorities. This can delay or increase the cost of development
or homebuilding.

Our new housing developments may be subject to
various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public
improvements. These assessments increase our development and
homebuilding costs and can cause increases in the prices of our
homes.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a
variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules
and regulations concerning protection of health and the
environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
the present and former uses of the site and adjoining
properties. These environmental laws may result in delays, may
cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and
may prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding
activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies
must also comply with various federal and state laws, consumer
credit rules and regulations and other rules and regulations
unique to such activities. Additionally, mortgage loans and
title activities originated under the FHA, VA, GNMA, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac are subject to rules and regulations imposed by
those agencies.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

We own a 52,000 square foot office complex,
consisting of three single-story buildings of steel and brick
construction, located in Arlington, Texas, that served as our
principal executive and administrative offices from September
1992 through November 2004. In December 2004, we began leasing
approximately 160,000 square feet of office space in
downtown Fort Worth, Texas that serves as our principal
executive and corporate administrative offices.



We also own several office buildings totaling
approximately 128,000 square feet and we lease
approximately 994,000 square feet of office space under
leases expiring through October 2011, in our various operating
markets to house our homebuilding and financial services
operating division and region offices.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other
contingencies in the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that, while the ultimate outcome of the contingencies
cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability, if
any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or operations.

ITEM 4.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY
    HOLDERS

None.



PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND
    RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Our common stock (the “Common Stock”)
is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
“DHI”. The following table shows the high and low
sales prices for the Common Stock for the periods indicated, as
reported by the NYSE, adjusted for the three-for-two stock split
(effected as a 50% stock dividend) of January 12, 2004 and
dividends declared per share (split-adjusted).

As of December 2, 2004, the closing price
was $35.29, and there were approximately 682 holders of record.

The declaration of cash dividends is at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among
other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements,
our general financial condition and general business conditions.
We are required to comply with certain covenants contained in
the bank agreements and many of our senior note and senior
subordinated note indentures. The most restrictive of these
requirements allows us to pay cash dividends on Common Stock in
an amount, on a cumulative basis, not to exceed 50% of
consolidated net income, as defined, subject to certain other
adjustments. Pursuant to the most restrictive of these
requirements, at September 30, 2004, we had approximately
$789.9 million available for the payment of dividends, the
acquisition of our common stock and other restricted payments.



ITEM 6.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Critical Accounting Policies

General

—
A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting
policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in
Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, and for the years ended
September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Each of our accounting
policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative
literature that collectively comprises Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) for public companies
operating in the United States of America. In instances where
alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we
have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the
nature of our business, the results of our operations and our
financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods
over each of the periods presented in the financial statements.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and
approved the accounting policies selected.

Basis of
presentation

— Our financial
statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of
its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation. We have also consolidated
certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing
lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of
Interpretation No. 46 issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”).

Segment
information

— Our reportable
business segments consist of homebuilding and financial
services. Our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its
revenue from constructing and selling single-family housing in
21 states and 63 markets throughout the United States. The
financial services segment generates revenue by originating and
selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title
insurance and closing services in many of the same markets. We
have no foreign subsidiaries or operations.

Revenue
recognition

— We recognize
homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and
possession of the property are transferred to the buyer.
Virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash
within a day or two of closing. We include amounts in transit
from title companies at the end of each reporting period in
homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our
homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers
for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes,
we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the
homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain
or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts,
depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract.

We recognize financial services revenues
associated with our title operations as homes are closed,
closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are
issued, all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home
is closed. We transfer all underwriting risk associated with
title insurance policies to third-party insurers. We recognize
the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage
operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights
are sold to third-party investors. Origination fees, net of
direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as
revenues, along with the associated gains and losses on the
sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans
are sold. We sell all mortgage loans and related servicing
rights to third-party investors.

Inventories and Cost of
Sales

— We state inventories
at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144. In addition to the costs of direct land
acquisition, land development and home construction, inventory
costs include interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead
costs incurred during development and home construction.
Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development
projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities,
maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect
overhead costs, such as compensation of construction
superintendents, sales personnel and division and region
management, advertising and builder’s risk insurance are
charged to SG&A expense as incurred.



We use the specific identification method for the
purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales
for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of
each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development
and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred)
based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in
each project. Any changes to the estimated total development
costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are
generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes
in the project.

When a home is closed, we generally have not yet
paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the
home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to
cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid
related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end
of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to
actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs remaining
to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each
month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on
closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued.
Although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future
could differ from our current estimate, our method has
historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual
costs to complete closed homes.

Each quarter, we review all components of our
inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs
and costs required to complete each home or project are
recoverable. If our review indicates that an impairment loss is
required under the SFAS No. 144 guidelines, we
estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter.
To date, such impairment losses have been insignificant in the
aggregate. Fair value estimation under SFAS No. 144
involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and,
due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results
could differ from such estimates.

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

— In January 2003,
the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” as amended
(“FIN 46”). FIN 46 provides guidance for the
financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain
variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain
business entities that either have equity investors with no
voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide
sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their
activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities
by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss
from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a
majority of the entities’ residual returns or both, defined
as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land
or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option
purchase contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in
consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms.
Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our
option deposits are non-refundable. Certain non-refundable
deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable
interest entity under the requirements of FIN 46. As such,
certain of our option purchase contracts result in the
acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the
land parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we
evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with
variable interest entities to determine whether we are the
primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of
the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this
evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with
which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase
contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated.

Since we own no equity interest in any of the
unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate
pursuant to FIN 46, we generally have little or no control
or influence over the operations of these entities or their
owners. When our requests for financial information are denied
by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and
liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the
fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been
assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the
land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed
that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset
recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a
related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party
investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any,
of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us.



Warranty
Costs

— We have established
warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a
warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts
charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty-related costs
for materials and labor required under one- and ten-year
warranty obligation periods. The one-year warranty is
comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten-year period is
for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are
based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each
market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to
reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we
build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual
future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
amounts.

Insurance Claim
Costs

— We have, and require
the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability
and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies
protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims,
subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and
other coverage limits. We reserve for costs to cover our
self-insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for
any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our
coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an
analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of
construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to
a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends
in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the
types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance
industry practices, and legal interpretations, among others.
Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining
these estimated reserve amounts, actual future costs could
differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts.

Interest rate
swaps

— We have two interest
rate swap agreements with a major United States bank under which
we receive each quarter the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) and pay a fixed amount that averages 5.1% on a
total notional amount of $200 million. We entered into both
of the ten-year swap contracts in 1998. Because we were
unwilling to “buy out” the bank’s current right
to cancel each swap during any quarter in which LIBOR exceeds
7%, we chose not to designate the swaps as cash-flow hedges
under SFAS No. 133. As a result, even though they
still protect us to some extent from increases in variable
interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility, we
are required to record the changes in their market value in our
income statement each quarter. At the end of each quarter, the
swaps’ market value will have changed depending upon the
market’s current anticipation of quarterly LIBOR rate
levels from the present until the swaps’ maturity in 2008.
The swaps’ market values generally vary directly with
changes in anticipated future LIBOR rates. Any future reductions
in anticipated LIBOR rates could result in corresponding future
reductions in their market value and charges to our income
statements. Similarly, any future increases in anticipated LIBOR
rates could result in corresponding future increases in their
market value and increases in our reported earnings. We cannot
predict the changes in either future LIBOR rates or the market
values of our swaps.

Goodwill

—
We adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of fiscal
2002. Under its provisions, we are no longer permitted to
amortize goodwill to earnings. Such amounts are recorded on our
balance sheet under the caption “Goodwill”.
SFAS No. 142 requires companies to periodically assess
recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether
any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded. We have
measured the fair value of our reporting units using a
discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of
our reporting units is greater than their book value and
therefore no impairment of goodwill exists. We regularly
evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that
indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be
recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures required by
SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive
estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties
associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from
such estimates.

Stock-based
compensation

— With the
approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our
Board of Directors, we occasionally issue to employees options
to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only
out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts
formally authorized by our common stockholders. We grant
approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of
the common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority
of the options granted vest ratably over a ten-year period. We
account for options under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board



(APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and, accordingly, recognize
no compensation expense for the grants. SFAS No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
(“SFAS No. 123”) and SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 123,” (“SFAS No. 148”) require
us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income
per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance
with SFAS No. 123. The SFAS No. 123
requirements applied only to options granted after its effective
date.

In March 2004, the FASB issued a Proposed
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard which would amend
SFAS No. 123 and require companies that issue
share-based payments to record compensation expense based on the
fair value of the share-based payment. We will adopt the
proposed statement when it becomes effective, and we do not
expect this change in accounting principle to materially affect
our results of operations in future periods.

Results of Operations —
Overview

We experienced significant increases in revenues
and earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30,
2004 and 2003, driven primarily by the continued growth of our
homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in
homebuilding profit margins.

The demand from first-time and move-up homebuyers
has remained favorable. Population growth, demographics,
immigration, household formations and changes in home ownership
rates were the primary long-term factors driving this housing
demand, with particular strength in our Southeast, Southwest and
West regions. Low mortgage rates were a positive influence on
housing demand during 2004 and 2003, during a period of
generally weak employment levels. In addition, because the
homebuilding industry in the United States is highly fragmented,
we have been able to capitalize on the benefits of our size,
such as our capital strength and access to lower material, labor
and capital costs, to generate continued growth by increasing
market share.

The mortgage industry was negatively impacted by
a decline in loan refinancing activity during 2004. This
resulted in increased competitive conditions and lower margins
in the mortgage markets, including the market for mortgage loans
for new home construction.

Key financial highlights for our fiscal years
ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

Homebuilding Operations:

Financial Services Operations:

•

Total financial services revenues increased 4%
    and 55% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting the
    focus of our mortgage and title operations on supporting our
    growing homebuilding



business, offset by the effects of increased
    competition in the mortgage industry for new home loans in
    fiscal 2004.

•

Financial services pre-tax income declined by 20%
    in fiscal 2004 after having increased by 66% in fiscal 2003, due
    to lower operating margins caused by the competitive conditions
    in the mortgage industry and changes in the product mix of
    mortgage loans originated and sold in 2004.

Consolidated Results:

•

Net income increased 56% and 55% in fiscal 2004
    and 2003, respectively, due to the improvements in consolidated
    revenues and homebuilding operating margins.

•

Diluted earnings per share increased 51% and 43%
    for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.

•

The effective income tax rate for fiscal year
    2004 was 38.4%, as compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2003 and 37.5% in
    fiscal 2002. The increases in our effective income tax rates in
    2004 and 2003 were due primarily to increases in pre-tax income
    in states with higher state income tax rates.

Our operating strategy for fiscal 2005 and future
years is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our
homebuilding business, while continuing to generate
profitability improvements and maintaining a strong balance
sheet. We plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by
investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding
markets through our capital allocation process.

Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared
    to Year Ended September 30, 2003

The following tables set forth key operating and
financial data for our homebuilding operations as of and for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003:



Homebuilding Operating Margin
Analysis

Net new sales orders represent the number and
dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net
of sales contract cancellations, during the year. The value of
net new sales orders increased 24%, to $11,406.2 million
(45,263 homes) in 2004 from $9,162.3 million (38,725 homes)
in 2003. The average price of a net new sales order in 2004 was
$252,000, up 7% from the $236,600 average in 2003. The number of
homes sold, value and the average price of net new sales orders
increased in each of our market regions during 2004 due to the
successful execution of our growth strategies and generally
strong demand for our homes in all of our market regions. The
largest increases in the value of net new sales orders occurred
in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, which is a result of
our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our
Florida, Virginia and Maryland markets, where housing demand is
strong. The increase in our average selling price reflects our
ability to increase prices in the markets where demand for our
homes is strongest, while we continue our efforts to ensure that
our product offerings and prices remain affordable for our
target customers, typically first-time and move-up homebuyers,
in most of our markets.

Sales backlog represents homes under contract but
not yet closed at the end of the period, some of which are
subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval, that
can result in cancellations. In the past, our backlog has been a
reliable indicator of the level of future closings, although
contracts in backlog may not all result in closings. At
September 30, 2004, the value of our backlog of sales
orders was $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes), up 25% from
$3,653.4 million (15,488 homes) at September 30, 2003.
The average sales price of homes in backlog was $265,900 at
September 30, 2004, up 13% from the $235,900 average at
September 30, 2003. The value of our sales backlog
increased in four of our five market regions, led by a 92%
increase in the Southeast region, which is a result of our
efforts to significantly increase our presence in our Florida
markets. The average selling price of homes in backlog increased
in all of our market regions, reflecting the generally strong
demand for our homes in fiscal 2004 which allowed us to increase
prices.

Revenues from home sales increased 26%, to
$10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004 from
$8,334.1 million (35,934 homes closed) in 2003. Revenues
from home sales increased by more than 20%



in all of our five market regions, and the number
of homes closed increased by 15% or more in all market regions
as well, reflecting the successful execution of our growth
strategies and our homebuilding divisions’ ability to
efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers. The average
selling price of homes we closed during 2004 was $240,800, up 4%
from $231,900 in 2003. The average selling price of homes closed
increased in four of our five market regions, with the largest
increases occurring in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 41%,
to $2,460.7 million in 2004 from $1,746.3 million in
2003. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total
homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
revenues increased 2.7 percentage points, to 23.1% in 2004,
from 20.4% in 2003. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage
of home sales revenues increased 2.2 percentage points, to
22.8% in 2004, from 20.6% in 2003, which is attributable to our
ability to increase home prices due to strong demand for our
homes in many of our markets and our ongoing efforts to control
and reduce construction costs as we achieve greater economies of
scale.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 17%, to
$959.0 million in 2004 from $817.0 million in 2003. As
a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased
0.6 percentage points, to 9.0% in 2004 from 9.6% in 2003.
The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues
is attributable to our ongoing cost control efforts and our
ability to generate higher revenue levels that better leverage
our existing fixed SG&A costs.

Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt
decreased by 1%, to $236.7 million in 2004 from
$239.5 million in 2003. Our average homebuilding debt
increased 5% in 2004 from 2003; however, during the past two
years we have replaced certain of our higher interest rate notes
with notes bearing lower interest rates and we have restructured
and amended our unsecured revolving credit facility, which
lowered our interest costs, resulting in this slight decrease in
interest incurred in 2004.

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory
under construction or development. During both years our
inventory under construction or development exceeded our
interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest
from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and
fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest
amortized to cost of sales increased by 13% to
$249.0 million in 2004 from $219.4 million in 2003.
This increase was attributable to a 20% increase in total cost
of sales, partially offset by the effects of the decline in
interest incurred.

Other income associated with homebuilding
activities was $9.9 million in 2004, compared to other
expense of $9.4 million in 2003. The major component of
other income in 2004 was an increase in the fair value of our
interest rate swaps of $8.1 million. The major component of
other expense in 2003 was $11.8 million of minority
interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures.

Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared
    to Year Ended September, 30 2002

The following tables set forth key operating and
financial data for our homebuilding operations as of and for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002:



Homebuilding Operating Margin
Analysis

The value of net new sales orders increased 33%,
to $9,162.3 million (38,725 homes) in 2003 from
$6,885.9 million (31,491 homes) in 2002. The value of net
new sales orders increased in all of our five market regions,
with the largest percentage increases occurring in the West and
Southeast regions. The overall increase in the value of net new
sales orders was due to generally strong housing demand
throughout the majority of our markets and the Schuler
acquisition. Excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of Schuler
prior to the February 21, 2003 anniversary date of the
acquisition, the value of net new sales orders increased 23%, to
$8,452.9 million, and the number of net new sales orders
increased 17%, to 36,706 homes. The average price of a net new
sales order in 2003 was $236,600, up 8% over the $218,700
average in 2002. The increase in average selling price was due
primarily to the increase in net new sales orders in the West
region, to 33% of the total net new sales orders in 2003 from
31% of net new sales orders in 2002. In the West region, average
selling prices are higher than in any of our other market
regions.



At September 30, 2003, the value of our
backlog of sales orders was $3,653.4 million (15,488
homes), up 29% from $2,825.2 million (12,697 homes) at
September 30, 2002. The average sales price of homes in
backlog was $235,900 at September 30, 2003, up 6% from the
$222,500 average at September 30, 2002. The value of our
sales backlog increased in all five of our market regions,
reflecting our continued execution of our growth strategies in
each region and the generally strong demand for our homes in the
majority of our markets.

Revenues from home sales increased 28%, to
$8,334.1 million (35,934 homes closed) in 2003 from
$6,529.6 million (29,761 homes closed) in 2002. Revenues
from home sales increased in all of our five market regions,
with the largest percentage increases occurring in the West and
Southeast regions. The increases in both revenues and homes
closed were due to generally strong housing demand throughout
the majority of our markets and the acquisition of Schuler.
Excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of Schuler prior to the
February 21, 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition, home
sales revenues increased 20% to $7,856.0 million (34,410
homes closed) in 2003 from $6,529.6 million (29,761 homes
closed) in 2002.

The average selling price of homes we closed
during 2003 was $231,900, up 6% from $219,400 in 2002. The
increase in average selling price was due primarily to the
increase in homes closed in the West region, to 34% of total
homes closed in 2003 from 32% of homes closed in 2002. In the
West region, average selling prices are higher than in any of
our other market regions.

Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 39%,
to $1,746.3 million in 2003 from $1,260.8 million in
2002. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total
homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
revenues increased 1.4 percentage points, to 20.4% in 2003,
from 19.0% in 2002. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage
of home sales revenues increased 1.5 percentage points, to
20.6% in 2003, from 19.1% in 2002. Most of the costs associated
with the sales of inventory acquired in the Schuler acquisition,
with lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair
value as of the date of acquisition, was recognized in 2002.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 26%, to
$817.0 million in 2003 from $646.8 million in 2002. As
a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased
0.2 percentage points, to 9.6% in 2003 from 9.8% in 2002.
The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues
was primarily due to our cost control efforts and the increased
leverage of fixed SG&A expenses achieved by the increase in
homebuilding revenues.

Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt
increased by 20%, to $239.5 million in 2003 from
$198.8 million in 2002. Our average homebuilding debt
increased 14% in 2003 from 2002. During 2003 we incurred a full
year of interest associated with the homebuilding debt acquired
in the Schuler acquisition, which is fixed rate debt with higher
interest rates than most of our other debt.

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory
under construction or development. During 2003 our inventory
under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing
debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding
debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to
debt we paid off prior to maturity. During 2002, we expensed the
portion of the interest related to interest bearing debt in
excess of our inventory under construction or development.
Interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 61% to
$219.4 million in 2003 from $136.2 million in 2002
while total cost of sales increased only 27% in 2003. The
disproportionately large increase in interest to total cost of
sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was attributable to the 2002
closings related to the Schuler acquisition that had little or
no capitalized interest associated with them.

Other expense associated with homebuilding
activities was $9.4 million in 2003, compared to
$16.9 million in 2002. The expense in 2003 is primarily due
to $11.8 million of minority interests in the income of our
consolidated joint ventures. Additionally, $4.2 million of
expense was recorded to write-down to estimated fair value the
carrying amounts of our investments in start-up and emerging
growth companies, which was offset by $3.6 million in
interest income and a $1.8 million increase in the fair
value of our interest rate swaps. The expense in 2002 was
primarily due to a $12.3 million decline in the fair



value of our interest rate swaps and a
$6.6 million write-down to estimated fair value of the
carrying amounts of our investments in start-up and emerging
growth companies.

Results of Operations — Financial
Services

Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared
    to Year Ended September 30, 2003

Revenues from the financial services segment
increased 4%, to $182.8 million in 2004 from
$176.0 million in 2003. The increase in financial services
revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of
mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding
operations, offset by a decline in the average mortgage revenues
earned per loan. The decrease in the average mortgage revenues
earned per loan was primarily due to a shift in the product mix
of mortgage loans originated and sold from higher margin
fixed-rate loans to lower margin adjustable-rate loans, and
increased competition due to excess capacity in the mortgage
industry, which has reduced the margins on all mortgage loans.

General and administrative expenses associated
with financial services increased 23%, to $121.0 million in
2004 from $98.3 million in 2003. As a percentage of
financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses
increased by 10.3 percentage points, to 66.2% in 2004 from
55.9% in 2003. The increase in general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the
related decrease in income before income taxes were due
primarily to the decline in average mortgage revenues earned per
loan and increased costs associated with strengthening our
financial services infrastructure to support our growing
homebuilding business and expanding our mortgage operations into
California.



Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared
    to Year Ended September 30, 2002

Revenues from the financial services segment
increased 55%, to $176.0 million in 2003 from
$113.6 million in 2002. The increase in financial services
revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of
mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding
operations and an increase in the average mortgage revenues
earned per loan.

General and administrative expenses associated
with financial services increased 45%, to $98.3 million in
2003 from $67.8 million in 2002. As a percentage of
financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses
decreased by 3.8 percentage points, to 55.9% in 2003 from
59.7% in 2002. The decrease in general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the
related increase in income before income taxes were due
primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues
generated from the increase in mortgage loans originated and the
increase in revenues earned per loan.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

We fund our homebuilding and financial services
operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings
under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or
equity securities. As we utilize our capital resources and
liquidity to fund the growth of our operations, we focus on
maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios.

At September 30, 2004, our ratio of
homebuilding debt to total capital was 38.9%, an improvement of
1.1 percentage points from 40.0% at September 30,
2003. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of
homebuilding notes payable (net of cash) divided by total
capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash



plus stockholders’ equity). Our
stockholders’ equity to total assets ratio increased
2.5 percentage points, to 44.1% at September 30, 2004,
from 41.6% at September 30, 2003.

We believe that we will be able to continue to
fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our
future cash needs (including debt maturities) through a
combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows from
operating activities, our existing credit facilities and the
issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets.

Homebuilding Capital
    Resources

Cash

— At
September 30, 2004, our available homebuilding cash and
cash equivalents amounted to $480.1 million.

Bank Credit Facility —

In March 2004, we restructured and
amended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility,
increasing it to $1.0 billion and extending its maturity to
March 25, 2008. The new facility included a
$350 million letter of credit sub-facility and an
uncommitted $250 million accordion feature that permitted
an increase in the facility. In June 2004, we exercised the
accordion feature and obtained commitments from our lenders that
increased the total size of the facility to $1.21 billion.
The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries other than our financial services
subsidiaries.

We had no outstanding cash borrowings on our
homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30,
2004 and 2003. Under the debt covenants associated with our
revolving credit facility, our additional homebuilding borrowing
capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the
unused portion of the facility, $1.1 billion at
September 30, 2004, or an amount determined under a
borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation,
the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving
credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the
various categories of our unencumbered inventory. At
September 30, 2004, the borrowing base arrangement would
have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source
to $2.2 billion. At September 30, 2004, we were in
compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and
restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and
our bank revolving credit facility.

Shelf Registration
Statements

— At
September 30, 2004, we had the capacity to issue new debt
or equity securities amounting to $1.75 billion under our
universal shelf registration statement. After the October 2004
issuance of $250 million of 4 7/8% Senior notes
due 2010, our remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity
securities was $1.5 billion. Also, at September 30,
2004, we had the capacity to issue approximately
22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition
shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part,
possible future business acquisitions.

Financial Services Capital
    Resources

Cash

— At
September 30, 2004, we had available financial services
cash and cash equivalents of $37.9 million.

Mortgage Warehouse
Loan Facility

— In
April 2004, our wholly-owned mortgage company restructured and
amended its mortgage warehouse loan facility, increasing the
facility to $300 million and extending its maturity to
April 8, 2005. This loan facility was amended on
September 28, 2004 for a 30-day period, temporarily
increasing the facility to $350 million to provide for
increased year-end closing volume. At September 30, 2004,
we had borrowings of $267.7 million outstanding under the
mortgage warehouse facility.

Commercial Paper Conduit
Facility

— Our wholly-owned
mortgage company also has a $300 million commercial paper
conduit facility (the “CP conduit facility”), which
expires on June 29, 2006. The terms of the facility are
renewable annually by the sponsoring banks. At
September 30, 2004, $225.0 million had been drawn
under the CP conduit facility.



The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP
conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company
or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt.
Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage
loans held for sale. The mortgage loans pledged to secure the CP
conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed
commercial paper issued by multi-seller conduits in the
commercial paper market. At September 30, 2004, our total
mortgage loans held for sale were $623.3 million. All
mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage
warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally
generated funds. Both of the financial services’ credit
facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in
compliance.

Operating Cash Flow
    Activities

During the year ended September 30, 2004, we
used $422.5 million of cash in our operating activities, as
compared to $423.3 million of cash provided by operations
during the prior year, resulting in net cash provided from
operating activities of $0.8 million for the two years
ended September 30, 2004.

Both the net cash used in operations in fiscal
2004 and the net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 were
the result of cash provided from net income and increases in
accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by cash used to
increase inventories, mortgage loans held for sale and other
assets, reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial
services operations. The variance in operating cash flows from
2003 to 2004 is a direct result of our decision to invest
$1.4 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal
2004 versus a $0.5 billion cash investment in inventory
growth in fiscal 2003.

A large portion of our cash invested in
inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be
used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years. Since
we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and
lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market
opportunities, we believe that cash flows from operating
activities before inventory additions is currently a better
indicator of our liquidity.

Investing Cash Flow
    Activities

In fiscal 2004 and 2003, cash used in investing
activities represented net purchases of property and equipment,
primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such
purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or
cash flows, and they typically do not vary significantly from
year to year.

Financing Cash Flow
    Activities

The majority of our short-term financing needs
are funded with cash generated from operations and funds
available under our homebuilding and financial services credit
facilities. Long-term financing needs are generally funded with
the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the
public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior
subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries other than our financial services
subsidiaries.

In January 2004, we issued $200 million of
5% senior notes due 2009. On June 15, 2004, we used
the majority of the proceeds of the issue to repay at maturity
the $150 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of
our 8 3/8% senior notes.

In July 2004, we issued $200 million of
6 1/8% senior notes due 2014. In September 2004, we
issued $250 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due
2014. We used the proceeds from both of these offerings to
reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

In October 2004, we issued $250 million of
4 7/8% senior notes due 2010. We used the proceeds
from this offering for general corporate purposes, including
land acquisition and development, home construction and
homebuilding operations and other working capital needs.

During fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors
declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.047 per common
share (split-adjusted), and three quarterly cash dividends of
$0.08 per common share, the last of which was paid on
August 20, 2004 to stockholders of record on August 6,
2004. On October 14, 2004,



our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend
of $0.08 per common share, which was paid on
November 2, 2004, to stockholders of record on
October 26, 2004.

Changes in Capital Structure

On December 1, 2003, our Board of Directors
declared a three-for-two common stock split (effected as a 50%
stock dividend), which was paid on January 12, 2004 to
stockholders of record on December 22, 2003.

On July 31, 2003, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our
common stock and up to $200 million of our outstanding debt
securities, as market conditions warrant. As of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had $175.6 million
remaining of the Board of Directors’ authorization for
repurchases of common stock and $200 million remaining of
the authorization for repurchases of debt securities.

Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial
    Commitments

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our
homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under
short-term and long-term debt agreements and lease payments
under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding
segment represent specific performance requirements under lot
option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land
contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We
expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary
course of business through our operating cash flows, our
homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by
issuing senior notes.

Our future cash requirements for contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2004 are presented below:

At September 30, 2004, our homebuilding
operations had outstanding letters of credit of
$133.8 million and surety bonds of $1,367.7 million,
issued by third parties, to secure performance under various
contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by
these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in
the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the
applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance
obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are
generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no
continuing obligations. We have no material third-party
guarantees.

To meet the financing needs of our customers, our
mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments
(“IRLCs”) to borrowers who have applied for loan
funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria.
Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months.
Some IRLCs are



committed immediately to a specific investor
through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments,
while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to
third-party investors.

We manage interest rate risk related to our
uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of
mortgage-backed securities (“FMBS”) and the infrequent
purchase of options on financial instruments. As of
September 30, 2004, our IRLCs totaled $562.8 million,
and we had approximately $117.0 million outstanding of FMBS
and $432.6 million of best efforts whole loan delivery
commitments related to our IRLCs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into
land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land
or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts
enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal
capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated
with land ownership and development. At September 30, 2004,
we had $251.4 million in deposits to purchase land and lots
with a total remaining purchase price of $4.9 billion, of
which only $128.1 million is subject to specific
performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or
lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. Pursuant
to FIN 46, we consolidated certain variable interest
entities with assets of $153.7 million.

Land and Lot Position and Homes in
Inventory

At September 30, 2004, we controlled
approximately 268,000 lots, 59% of which were lots under option
or similar contracts. The following is a summary of our land/lot
position at September 30:

The percentage of our lots controlled under
option contracts increased during 2004 as our operating
divisions used our position as a large, national homebuilder to
negotiate favorable land acquisition terms that utilize our
capital efficiently and mitigate our land ownership risks.

At September 30, 2004, we had a total of
approximately 24,000 homes under construction, including
approximately 1,600 model homes and less than 200 unsold homes
that had been completed for more than six months. At
September 30, 2003, we had a total of approximately 21,000
homes under construction, including approximately 1,450 model
homes and less than 300 unsold homes that had been completed for
more than six months.

Inflation

We and the homebuilding industry in general may
be adversely affected during periods of high inflation,
primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material
construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates
can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage
financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through
to our customers any increases in our costs through increased
sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is
no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse
impact on our future results of operations.



Safe Harbor Statement and Risks

Certain statements contained in this report, as
well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in
periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts,
stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about
us, may be construed as “forward-looking statements”
as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These forward-looking statements typically include the
words “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,”
“goal,” “intend,” “objective,”
“plan,” “projection,” “seek,”
“strategy” or other words of similar meaning. Any or
all of the forward-looking statements included in this report
and in any other of our reports or public statements may not
approximate actual experience, and the expectations derived from
them may not be realized, due to known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially
from the results discussed in and anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. The following cautionary discussion
of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes
factors we believe could adversely affect us. Other factors
beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us.



We undertake no obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. However, any
further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent
reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be consulted.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
    MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long
term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates
and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate
debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of
the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows.
Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates
generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument,
but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have
mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our
variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap
agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the
variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation
to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result,
interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a
significant impact on our fixed-rate debt until such time as we
are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.



Our interest rate swaps were not designated as
hedges under SFAS No. 133 when it was adopted on
October 1, 2000. We are exposed to market risk associated
with changes in the fair values of the swaps, and such changes
must be reflected in our income statements.

Our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate
risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services.
Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers
who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit
and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration
of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to
a specific investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan
delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to
being committed to third-party investors. Forward sales of
mortgage-backed securities (“FMBS”) are used to
protect uncommitted IRLCs against the risk of changes in
interest rates. FMBS related to IRLCs are classified and
accounted for as non-designated derivative instruments, with
gains and losses recorded in current earnings. FMBS related to
funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges,
with changes in the value of the derivative instruments
recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value
of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair
value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness,
which for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002
was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At
September 30, 2004, total FMBS to mitigate interest rate
risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and
uncommitted IRLCs totaled $144.0 million. Uncommitted IRLCs
totaled approximately $130.1 million, the duration of which
was less than six months and uncommitted mortgage loans held for
sale totaled approximately $27.6 million. At
September 30, 2004, the fair value of the FMBS and IRLCs
was an insignificant amount.

The following table sets forth, as of
September 30, 2004, for our debt obligations, principal
cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest
rates and estimated fair market value. In addition, the table
sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates
and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

D.R. Horton, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
subsidiaries at September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE A — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of D. R. Horton, Inc. and its wholly-owned,
majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (the Company), as
well as certain variable interest entities required to be
consolidated pursuant to Interpretation No. 46 issued by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.

Reporting Segments

The Company has two operating and reporting
segments: Homebuilding and Financial Services. Homebuilding is
the Company’s core business, generating 98% of consolidated
revenues and 91% to 95% of consolidated income before income
taxes in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The Company’s homebuilding segment is
primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land for
residential purposes and the construction and sale of
residential homes on such land, in 21 states and 63 markets
in the United States. The homebuilding segment generates most of
its revenues from the sale of completed homes, with a lesser
amount from the sale of land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment
provides mortgage banking and title agency services principally
to customers of the Company’s homebuilding segment. The
Company does not retain or service the mortgages that it
originates, but, rather, sells the mortgages and related
servicing rights to investors. The financial services segment
generates its revenue from originating and selling mortgages and
collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.

Assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
operating income of the Company’s reporting segments are
separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of income. The accounting policies of
the reporting segments are described throughout this note.

Revenue Recognition

Homebuilding revenue is recognized at the time of
the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the
property are transferred to the buyer. Virtually all
homebuilding revenues are received in cash within two days of
closing. Financial services revenues associated with the
Company’s title operations are recognized as homes are
closed, closing services are rendered and title insurance
policies are issued, all of which generally occur simultaneously
as each home is closed. The majority of the revenues associated
with the Company’s mortgage operations is recognized when
the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
third-party investors. Origination fees, net of direct
origination costs, are deferred and recognized as revenues,
along with the associated gains or losses on the sale of the
loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold to
third-party investors.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an initial maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents. Amounts in transit from
title companies for home closings are included in cash.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories and Cost of Sales

Finished inventories, inventories under
construction or development or held for development are stated
at accumulated costs, unless such costs would not be recovered
from the cash flows generated by future disposition. In this
instance, such inventories are measured at fair value, less
disposal costs.

Inventory costs include land, land development
and home construction costs, and interest and real estate taxes
related to property under development and construction.
Applicable direct overhead costs incurred after development
projects or homes are substantially complete such as utilities,
maintenance, and cleaning are charged to SG&A expense as
incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of
construction superintendents, sales personnel and division and
region management, advertising and builder’s risk
insurance, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are allocated to
individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the cost of
residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
when home construction begins. Home construction costs are
accumulated for each specific home.

Cost of sales for homes closed includes the
specific construction costs of each home, land acquisition and
land development costs allocated to each home, closing costs and
sales commissions paid to third parties, related interest and
real estate taxes, and an estimate of future warranty and
related costs for the homes closed.

Each quarter, we review all components of our
inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs
and costs required to complete each home or project are
recoverable. If our review indicates that an impairment loss is
required under the SFAS No. 144 guidelines, we estimate and
record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter. To date, such
impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate.

Interest

The Company capitalizes interest costs to
inventory during development and construction. Capitalized
interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is
delivered to the buyer. The following table summarizes the
Company’s homebuilding interest costs incurred,
capitalized, charged to cost of sales and expensed directly
during the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Consolidated Land Inventory Not
    Owned

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” as amended (“FIN 46”). FIN 46
provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of
interests in certain variable interest entities, which
FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either
have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity
investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires
consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to
a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’
activities or is entitled to receive



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a majority of the entities’ residual returns
or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable
interest entity.

In the ordinary course of its homebuilding
business, the Company enters into land and lot option purchase
contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction
of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, the Company will
fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not
the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in
time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option
purchase contracts, many of the Company’s option deposits
are non-refundable. Certain non-refundable deposits are deemed
to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity
under the requirements of FIN 46. As such, certain of the
Company’s option purchase contracts result in the
acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the
land parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the
Company evaluates those land and lot option purchase contracts
with variable interest entities to determine whether the Company
is the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the
variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity.
Based on this evaluation, if the Company is the primary
beneficiary of an entity with which the Company has entered into
a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest
entity is consolidated.

Since the Company owns no equity interest in any
of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that it must
consolidate pursuant to FIN 46, the Company generally has
little or no control or influence over the operations of these
entities or their owners. When the Company’s requests for
financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain
assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities
are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the
consolidated entities have been assumed to be the remaining
contractual purchase price of the land or lots the Company is
purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have
no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or
lots the Company has the option to buy with a related offset to
minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the
variable interest entity.

The consolidation of these variable interest
entities added $153.7 million and $105.0 million in
land inventory not owned and minority interests to the
Company’s balance sheets at September 30, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The Company’s obligations related to
these land or lot option contracts are guaranteed by cash
deposits totaling $17.2 million and $13.9 million and
performance letters of credit, promissory notes and surety bonds
totaling $3.3 million and $17.6 million, as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Creditors, if
any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse
against the Company.

Including the deposits with the variable interest
entities above, the Company has deposits amounting to
$251.4 million to purchase land and lots with a total
remaining purchase price of $4.9 billion at
September 30, 2004. For the variable interest entities
which are unconsolidated because the Company is not subject to a
majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority
of the entities’ residual returns, the maximum exposure to
loss is limited to the amounts of the Company’s option
deposits, which totaled $217.2 million at
September 30, 2004.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset. Depreciable lives for model home furniture typically
range from 2 to 3 years, depreciable lives for office
furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years,
and depreciable lives for buildings and improvements typically
range from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
$118.1 million and $90.2 million as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation
expense was $43.7 million, $38.3 million and
$30.4 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Long-lived assets

Potential impairments of long-lived assets are
reviewed annually or when events and circumstances warrant an
earlier review. In accordance with SFAS No. 144,
impairment is determined when estimated future undiscounted cash
flows associated with an asset are less than the asset’s
carrying value.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
over net assets acquired. The Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
effective October 1, 2001. Upon the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, goodwill is subject to an annual
impairment test. Other intangible assets continue to be
amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill is reviewed for
potential impairment annually or when events and circumstances
warrant an earlier review. Impairment is determined to exist
when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its
carrying value. The Company performed the required impairment
tests during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 and determined that no
goodwill impairment existed.

Accumulated amortization related to goodwill was
$38.9 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003.
Amortization of other intangible assets was $3.7 million,
$1.2 million and $0.9 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The carrying values of other intangible
assets as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 were $0 and
$3.7 million, net of accumulated amortization of
$5.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively.

Warranty Costs

The Company provides its homebuyers a one-year
comprehensive limited warranty for all parts and labor and a
ten-year limited warranty for major construction defects. Since
the Company subcontracts its homebuilding work to subcontractors
who provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance
prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to
workmanship and materials are generally the primary
responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty reserves have
been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a
warranty liability for each home delivered. The amounts charged
are based on management’s estimate of expected
warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation
periods. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon
historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it
operates and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative
risks associated with the types of homes built and the
geographic areas in which they are built. The following table
sets forth the Company’s warranty reserve:

Insurance Claim Costs

The Company has, and requires the majority of its
subcontractors to have, general liability and workers
compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect the
Company against a portion of its risk of loss from claims,
subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and
other coverage limits. The Company reserves for costs to cover
its self-insured and deductible amounts under those policies and
for



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

any costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of its
coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an
analysis of the Company’s historical claims which includes
an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Expenses
related to such claims were approximately $80.9 million,
$43.5 million, and $21.0 million in fiscal 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively.

Minority Interests

Through acquisitions, the Company has assumed
several joint venture arrangements on construction projects
whereby the Company is entitled to a percentage of the profits
and/or losses. The Company has a controlling interest in these
joint ventures, so their financial position and results of
operations are consolidated in the Company’s financial
statements and the partners’ equity positions are recorded
as minority interests. Also, included in minority interests is
the estimated fair value of all third-party interests in
variable interest entities consolidated pursuant to FIN 46.

Advertising costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as they
are incurred. Advertising expense was approximately
$64.3 million, $59.3 million and $46.7 million in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is based upon the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each year. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive
securities outstanding.

On February 5, 2002, each of the
Company’s 381,113 Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes
outstanding first became eligible for conversion into
26.2391 shares of the Company’s common stock. These
Convertible Senior Notes were convertible on any date as of
which the average closing price of the Company’s common
stock for the twenty preceding trading days exceeded the
specified threshold of 110% of the accreted value of each note,
divided by the conversion rate. The twenty-day average closing
price of the Company’s common stock exceeded the specified
threshold at the end of the March 31, 2002 and
June 30, 2002 quarters and for a portion of the quarter
ended June 30, 2003, which had the effect of increasing the
denominator for diluted earnings per share. Also, the numerator
for diluted earnings per share was increased by tax-effected
interest expense and amortization of issuance costs associated
with the Convertible Senior Notes for the March 31, 2002,
June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2003 quarters. On
May 27, 2003, the Company called the zero coupon
convertible senior notes for redemption. The call for redemption
gave the note holders the right to convert their notes into
shares of our common stock or to redeem them for cash at their
accreted value as of the redemption date. All of the notes were
presented by June 26, 2003 for conversion into D.R. Horton
common stock, and accordingly the Company issued approximately
10 million shares of common stock in exchange for the
notes, whose total accreted value as of the conversion dates was
approximately $214.1 million.

The following table sets forth the numerators and
denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share:

In December 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors declared a three-for-two common stock split (effected
as a 50% stock dividend), which was paid on January 12,
2004 to stockholders of record on December 22, 2003. The
average share amounts presented above for the years ended
September 30, 2003 and 2002 were restated to reflect the
effects of the three-for-two stock split.

Options to purchase 4.1 million shares
of common stock at various prices were outstanding during fiscal
2002 but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than
the average market price of the common shares and, therefore,
their effect would be antidilutive. All options outstanding
during fiscal 2004 and 2003 were included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company may, with the approval of the
Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, grant stock
options for a fixed number of shares to employees. The Company
accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. The
Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions as specified by
the SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”), as
amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure” (“SFAS No. 148”). The
exercise price of the Company’s employee stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, and therefore no compensation expense is recognized for
the initial grant. SFAS No. 123 and
SFAS No. 148 require disclosure of pro forma net
income and pro forma net income per share as if the fair value
based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense
for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 for options granted after fiscal
1995.

The following table sets forth the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method
had been applied:

In December 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors declared a three-for-two common stock split (effected
as a 50% stock dividend), which was paid on January 12,
2004 to stockholders of record on December 22, 2003. The
net income per share amounts presented above for the years ended
September 30, 2003 and 2002 were restated to reflect the
effects of the three-for-two stock split.

Interest rate swaps

The Company entered into two ten-year interest
rate swap agreements in 1998 with a major United States bank
under which it receives each quarter the London Inter-Bank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) and pays a fixed amount that
averages 5.1% on a total notional amount of
$200 million. At the end of each quarter, the swaps’
market value will have changed depending upon the market’s
current anticipation of quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the
present until the swaps’ maturity in 2008. The swaps’
market values generally vary directly with changes in
anticipated future LIBOR rates. The swaps do not qualify as
cash-flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, so changes in the
swaps’ fair value must be recorded in the consolidated
statements of income. The fair values of the interest rate swaps
were liabilities to the Company of $12.7 million at
September 30, 2004 and $20.8 million at
September 30, 2003, and are recorded in homebuilding other
liabilities. Changes in their fair values are recorded in
homebuilding other income or expense. During the years ended
September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company had gains
related to the interest rate swaps of $8.1 million,
$1.8 million and a loss of $12.3 million, respectively.

Mortgage loans

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of
single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying
property. Loans that have been closed but not committed to a
third-party investor are matched with forward sales of mortgage
backed securities (“FMBS”) that are designated as fair
value hedges. Hedged loans are typically committed to
third-party investors within three days of origination. All
loans held for sale are carried at cost adjusted for changes in
fair value after the date of designation of an effective hedge,
based on either sale commitments or current market quotes. Any
gain or loss on the sale of loans is recognized at the time of
sale. As of September 30, 2004, the Company had
$27.6 million in loans not committed to third-party
investors which were hedged with $27.0 million of FMBS.
During the



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and
2002, the Company had net gains on sales of loans of
$87.5 million, $91.5 million, and $55.1 million,
respectively.

The forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
associated with uncommitted, funded loans are designated as fair
value hedges of the risk of changes in the overall fair value of
the related loans. Accordingly, changes in the value of the
derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings, as
are changes in the value of the loans. During the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company’s
net gains related to the ineffective portion of its fair value
hedging instruments were insignificant. The net gains are
included in financial services revenues.

Loan commitments

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the
Company is party to interest rate lock commitments
(“IRLCs”) which are extended to borrowers who have
applied for loan funding and meet certain defined credit and
underwriting criteria. In accordance with SFAS No. 133
and related Derivatives Implementation Group conclusions, the
Company classifies and accounts for IRLCs as non-designated
derivative instruments at fair value with gains and losses
recorded in current earnings. At September 30, 2004 and
2003, the Company’s IRLCs totaled $562.8 million and
$458.7 million, respectively.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to
its IRLCs through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery
commitments, forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and the
infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments. These
instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and are
accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses
recorded in current earnings. As of September 30, 2004 the
Company had approximately $117.0 million outstanding of
FMBS and $432.6 million of best efforts whole loan delivery
commitments related to its IRLCs.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In October 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) announced that Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment,” would become effective for most
publicly owned companies for interim or annual periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. This Statement would require companies
to record compensation expense for all share-based payments,
such as employee stock options, at fair value. The FASB plans to
issue SFAS No. 123R in its final form on or around
December 15, 2004. The Company does not believe that the
implementation of the provisions of SFAS No. 123R will
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Reclassification

Certain prior year balances have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 presentation.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE B — NOTES PAYABLE

The Company’s notes payable at their
principal amounts, net of unamortized discount or premium, as
applicable, consist of the following:

The Company filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a universal shelf registration statement
registering $2 billion in debt and equity securities
effective in August 2004. At September 30, 2004, the
remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity securities
amounted to $1.75 billion. After the October 2004 issuance
of $250 million of 4 7/8% Senior notes due 2010,
the remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity securities
amounted to $1.5 billion.

Maturities of consolidated notes payable,
assuming the mortgage warehouse and commercial paper conduit
facilities are not extended or renewed, are $740.0 million
in 2005, $16.4 million in 2006, $5.5 million in 2007,
$217.6 million in 2008, $821.2 million in 2009 and
$1,695.5 million thereafter.

Homebuilding:

In March 2004, the Company restructured and
amended its existing unsecured revolving credit facility,
increasing it to $1 billion and extending its maturity to
March 25, 2008. The new facility included



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

a $350 million letter of credit sub-facility
and an uncommitted $250 million accordion feature that
permitted an increase in the facility. In June 2004, the Company
exercised the accordion feature and obtained commitments from
its lenders that increased the total size of the facility to
$1.21 billion. Borrowing capacity of this facility is
reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At
September 30, 2004, the Company had borrowing capacity from
this facility of $1.1 billion. The facility is guaranteed
by substantially all of the Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiaries other than its financial services subsidiaries.
Borrowings bear daily interest at rates based upon the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon the
Company’s ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its
senior unsecured debt rating. In addition to the stated interest
rates, the revolving credit facility requires the Company to pay
certain fees. The interest rates of the unsecured bank debt at
September 30, 2004 and 2003 were 3.1% and 2.6%,
respectively.

Following is a summary of the key terms of each
of the Company’s unsecured homebuilding notes payable
outstanding as of September 30, 2004, including the annual
effective interest rate of each series of notes, after giving
effect to the amortization of deferred financing costs,
discounts and premiums.

(1)

Interest is payable semi-annually on each of the
    series of Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes.

(2)

Each series of notes that is redeemable may be
    redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a
    premium declining ratably to par over a three-year period
    beginning on the date indicated.

(3)

The Company may only redeem up to 35% of the
    amount originally issued with the proceeds of public equity
    offerings at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
    plus a premium and accrued interest for up to three years after
    the date of issuance.

All series of Senior Notes are senior obligations
of the Company and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to
all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Company,
and senior to all existing and



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

future indebtedness expressly subordinated to
them. The Senior Subordinated Notes rank behind all existing and
future Senior Notes and bank credit facilities. Both the Senior
and Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed by substantially
all of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries other than
its financial services subsidiaries. Upon a change of control of
the Company, holders of all series of the notes have the right
to require the Company to redeem such notes at a price of 101%
of the par amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest.

The bank credit facilities and the indentures for
the Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes contain covenants
which, taken together, limit investments in inventory, stock
repurchases, cash dividends and other restricted payments,
incurrence of indebtedness, asset dispositions and creation of
liens, and require certain levels of tangible net worth. At
September 30, 2004, under the most restrictive covenants,
the additional debt the Company could incur would be limited to
$2.2 billion. Additionally, cash dividends paid on or
repurchases of the Company’s common stock and other
restricted payments are limited to an amount not to exceed, on a
cumulative basis, 50% of consolidated net income, as defined,
subject to certain other adjustments. Pursuant to the most
restrictive of these requirements, the Company had approximately
$789.9 million available for the payment of dividends and
other restricted payments at September 30, 2004.

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to
help manage a portion of its interest rate exposure. The
agreements convert a notional amount of $200 million from a
variable rate to a fixed rate. These agreements are cancelable
by a third party during periods where LIBOR exceeds 7%. The
agreements expire at dates through September, 2008. The Company
does not expect non-performance by the counter-party, a major
U.S. bank, and any losses incurred in the event of
non-performance are not expected to be material. Net payments or
receipts under these agreements are recorded as adjustments to
interest incurred. As a result of these agreements, the
Company’s net interest costs were increased by
$7.5 million in 2004 and 2003 and $6.0 million in 2002.

Financial Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary
restructured and amended its mortgage warehouse loan facility in
April 2004, increasing the facility to $300 million and
extending its maturity to April 8, 2005, at the 30-day
LIBOR rate plus a fixed premium. Additionally, this loan
facility was amended on September 28, 2004 for a 30-day
period, temporarily increasing the facility to $350 million
to provide for increased year-end closing volume. The mortgage
warehouse facility is secured by certain mortgage loans held for
sale and is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the
guarantors of the Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes. The
interest rates of the mortgage warehouse line payable at
September 30, 2004 and 2003 were 2.7% and 2.2%,
respectively.

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary also has a
$300 million commercial paper conduit facility (the
“CP conduit facility”), which expires on June 29,
2006, the terms of which are renewable annually by the
sponsoring banks. The CP conduit facility is secured by certain
mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by D.R.
Horton, Inc. or any of the guarantors of the Senior and Senior
Subordinated Notes. The mortgage loans pledged to secure the CP
conduit facility are used as collateral for mortgage-backed
securities sold in the secondary commercial paper markets. The
interest rates of the CP conduit facility at September 30,
2004 and 2003 were 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively.

NOTE C — ACQUISITIONS

On February 21, 2002, Schuler Homes, Inc.
merged with and into D.R. Horton, Inc., with D.R. Horton
the surviving corporation. At the time of the merger,
Schuler’s assets amounted to $1,393.3 million,
principally inventory. The total merger consideration of
$1,821.4 million consisted of the issuance of
20,079,532 shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. common stock, valued
at $30.93 per share (the average

closing price of D.R. Horton common stock for a
period of ten trading days from December 4, 2001 to
December 17, 2001); the payment of $168.7 million in
cash; the assumption of $802.2 million of Schuler’s
debt, $238.2 million of which was paid at closing; the
assumption of trade payables and other liabilities amounting to
$218.7 million; and the assumption of $10.8 million of
obligations to the Schuler entities’ minority interest
holders. Also, D.R. Horton issued options to purchase
approximately 527,000 shares of D.R. Horton common stock to
Schuler employees to replace outstanding Schuler stock options.
The fair value of the options issued was $10.4 million and
was recorded as additional capital. The fair value of the
unvested options issued was $6.0 million and was recorded
as unearned compensation. The unearned compensation was
amortized over the remaining vesting period of the stock
options. The amount of goodwill acquired in the Schuler
acquisition was $441.6 million of which $30.9 million
is deductible for tax purposes. There were no other significant
changes in goodwill during the years ended September 30,
2004, 2003 and 2002.

The merger was treated as a purchase of Schuler
by D.R. Horton for accounting purposes; therefore, Schuler
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet at their fair market values as of
February 21, 2002. Schuler’s results of operations
from February 22, 2002 to September 30, 2002 are
included in the Company’s results of operations for the
year ended September 30, 2002.

The following unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial data for the year ending September 30,
2002 were derived from the historical financial statements of
D.R. Horton, Inc. and Schuler. The unaudited pro forma combined
condensed financial data give effect to the merger with Schuler
as if it had occurred at the beginning of the year ended
September 30, 2002. Pro forma adjustments to the historical
financial data reflect those that we deem appropriate and are
factually supported based upon currently available information.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial data has been included for comparative purposes only
and does not purport to show what the operating results would

stock in connection with future acquisitions.

On July 31, 2003, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of the
Company’s common stock and outstanding debt securities, as
market conditions warrant. As of September 30, 2004 and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. These differences primarily relate
to the following:

The net deferred tax assets are included in the
balance sheet as other assets.

The difference between income tax expense and tax
computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of
35% to income before taxes is due to the following:

NOTE F — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all Company
employees who have been with the Company for a period of six
months or more. The Company matches portions of employees’
voluntary contributions. Additional employer contributions in
the form of profit sharing are at the discretion of the Company.
Expenses for the plan were $7.5 million, $6.9 million
and $6.0 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (“SERP”) is a non-qualified deferred
compensation program that provides benefits payable to certain
management employees upon retirement, death, or termination of
employment with the Company. Under it, the Company accrues an
unfunded benefit based on a percentage of the eligible
employees’ salaries, as well as an interest factor based
upon a predetermined formula. The Company recorded
$1.5 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million of
expense for this plan in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

In June 2002, the Company established a new
deferred compensation plan to a select group of employees. The
participating employees designate investments for their
contributions; however, the



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company is not required to invest the
contributions in the designated investments. The Company records
as expense the amount that the employee contributions would have
earned had the funds been invested in the designated
investments. The Company recorded $2.2 million,
$1.3 million and $0.6 million of expense for this plan
in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common
stock of the Company at a discounted price of 85% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of purchase. Under the
terms of the plan, the total fair market value of the common
stock that an eligible employee may purchase each year is
limited to the lesser of 15% of the employee’s annual
compensation or $25,000. Under the plan, employees of the
Company purchased 64,526 shares for $2.5 million in
fiscal 2004, 40,736 shares for $0.9 million in fiscal 2003
and 18,460 shares for $0.4 million in fiscal 2002.

The Company Stock Incentive Plans provide for the
granting of stock options to certain key employees of the
Company to purchase shares of common stock. Options are granted
at exercise prices which equal the market value of the
Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. Options
generally expire 10 years after the dates on which they
were granted. Options generally vest over periods of 5 to
10 years. There were 459,185 and 3,205,962 shares
available for future grants under the Plans at
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
issued a three-for-two stock split on January 12, 2004. The
amounts in the following table have been adjusted to reflect the
effects of the stock splits.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted average fair value of grants made in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $16.45, $8.08 and $8.57 per
share, respectively. The amounts for fiscal 2003 and 2002 have
been adjusted for the three-for-two stock split (effected as a
50% stock dividend) of January 2004.

The fair values of the options granted were
estimated on the date of their grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model based on the following weighted average
assumptions:

NOTE G — FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments are based on quoted market prices, where available,
or are estimated. Fair value estimates are made at a specific
point in time based on relevant market information and
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are
subjective in nature, involve matters of judgment and therefore,
cannot be determined with precision. Estimated fair values are
significantly affected by the assumptions used. The
Company’s methods and assumptions used in estimating fair
values are described below.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, the mortgage warehouse facility, the commercial
paper conduit facility and other secured notes payable as
reported in the Company’s balance sheets approximate their
fair values due to their short maturity or floating interest
rate terms, as applicable.

For the Senior and Senior Subordinated Notes,
fair values represent quoted market prices. For our interest
rate swaps, fair values represent market values as determined by
the issuer of the swaps based upon the market’s current
anticipation of future LIBOR rate levels. For mortgage loans
held for sale, forward sales of mortgage backed securities and
interest rate lock commitments, the fair values are estimated
based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.
The table below sets forth the carrying values and estimated
fair values of the Company’s Senior and Senior Subordinated
Notes, interest rate swaps, mortgage loans held for sale,
forward sales of mortgage backed securities and interest rate
lock commitments.

NOTE H — COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

The Company is involved in lawsuits and other
contingencies in the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that, while the ultimate outcome of the contingencies
cannot be predicted with certainty, the ultimate liability, if
any, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position.

The Company has established reserves for
contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business,
including warranty costs on closed homes and the expected costs
of the self-insured portion of general liability and workers
compensation insurance claims. The Company’s estimates of
the amounts to be charged to these reserves are based on
historical data and trends, including but not limited to costs
relative to revenues, home closings and product types, and
include estimates of the costs of unreported claims related to
past operations. The Company’s total reserves for such
items were $223.2 million and $137.2 million at
September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to
procure land or lots for the construction of homes. At
September 30, 2004, the Company had cash deposits of
$220.3 million, promissory notes of $9.8 million, and
letters of credit and surety bonds of $21.3 million to
purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of
$4.9 billion. Only $128.1 million of the
$4.9 billion in land lot option purchase contracts contain
specific performance clauses which will require the Company to
purchase the land or lots. The majority of land and lots under
contract are expected to be purchased within three years.

Additionally, in the normal course of its
business activities, the Company provides standby letters of
credit and surety bonds, issued by third parties, to secure
performance under various contracts. At September 30, 2004,
outstanding standby letters of credit were $133.8 million
and surety bonds were $1,367.7 million. The Company has an
additional capacity of $236.9 million for standby letters
of credit under its revolving credit facility.

The Company leases office space and equipment
under non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum annual lease
payments under these leases at September 30, 2004
approximate (in millions):

Rent expense approximated $33.2 million,
$27.7 million and $25.1 million for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

EVP’s interest in Encore, this former director advised and
assisted the Company in its homebuilder acquisitions. In
connection with the termination of the Company’s investment
program through Encore, the existing agreement with EVP was
terminated, along with EVP’s interests in Encore. After
such termination, through advisory arrangements with the
Company, this former director continued to monitor Encore and
affiliate investments and to advise and assist the Company in
its homebuilder acquisitions and in the process of integrating
acquired homebuilding operations. For this former
director’s advice and assistance during the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2002, the Company paid EVP
$2.0 million, in addition to the reimbursement of expenses.
The advisory arrangements terminated as of September 30,
2002.
