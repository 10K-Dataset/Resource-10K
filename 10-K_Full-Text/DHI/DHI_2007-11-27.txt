2007 ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the
    United States, based on homes closed during the twelve months
    ended September 30, 2007. We construct and sell high
    quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states
    and 83 metropolitan markets of the United States, primarily
    under the name of D.R. Horton,

America’s Builder.

We
    are a Fortune 500 company, and our common stock is included
    in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the
    context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,”
    the “Company,” “we” and “our” used
    herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
    its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In
    1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and
    businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential
    home construction and development companies owned or controlled
    by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public
    offering of our common stock. The growth of our company over the
    years was achieved by investing available capital into our
    existing homebuilding markets and into

start-up

operations in new markets. Additionally, we acquired numerous
    other homebuilding companies, which strengthened our market
    position in existing markets and expanded our geographic
    presence and product offerings in other markets. Our homes
    generally range in size from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet and
    in price from $90,000 to $900,000. Although we have maintained
    our position as the nation’s largest homebuilder, the
    current downturn in our industry has resulted in a decrease in
    the size of our operations during fiscal 2007, as we have been
    affected by, and have reacted to, the weakened market for new
    homes. For the year ended September 30, 2007, we closed
    41,370 homes with an average closing sales price of
    approximately $259,200.

Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage
    banking and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our
    homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    provides mortgage financing services, principally to the
    purchasers of the homes we build. We generally do not seek to
    retain or service the mortgages we originate but, rather, seek
    to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
    Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents
    by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
    services, primarily to the purchasers of our homes.

Our financial reporting segments consist of seven homebuilding
    segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding
    operations are by far the most substantial part of our business,
    comprising approximately 98% of consolidated revenues, which
    were $11.3 billion in fiscal 2007. Our homebuilding
    operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of
    completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and
    lots. In addition to building traditional single-family detached
    homes, we also build attached homes, such as town homes,
    duplexes, triplexes and condominiums (including some mid-rise
    buildings), which share common walls and roofs. The sale of
    detached homes generated approximately 81%, 80%, and 83% of home
    sales revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our
    financial services segment generates its revenues from
    originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title
    insurance agency and closing services.

We make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our
    Internet website all of our reports required to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports include
    our annual report on

Operating
    Strategy

For the greatest part of our company’s

30-year

existence, we maintained significant year-over-year growth and
    profitability. We achieved this success through an operating
    strategy focused on capturing greater market share, while also
    maintaining a strong balance sheet. To execute our strategy, we
    invested available capital in our existing homebuilding markets
    through our capital allocation process, and entered new markets
    as opportunities were available. We also actively evaluated
    homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose, some of
    which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our growth.

During fiscal 2006 and 2007, however, due to the progressive
    softening of demand in our homebuilding markets, we have
    experienced declines in revenues and gross profit, and we
    incurred a loss in fiscal 2007. Although we believe the
    long-term fundamentals which support housing demand remain solid
    and the current negative conditions will moderate over time, the
    timing of a recovery in the housing market is unclear.
    Consequently, while our long-term strategy remains to continue
    to profitably grow our homebuilding business, our primary focus
    while market conditions are weak is to strengthen our financial
    condition by reducing inventories of homes and land, controlling
    and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating
    positive cash flows from operations and using the cash primarily
    to reduce outstanding debt.

Geographic
    Diversity

From 1978 to late 1987, our homebuilding activities were
    conducted in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We then began
    diversifying geographically by entering additional markets, both
    through

start-up

operations and acquisitions. We now operate in 27 states
    and 83 markets. This provides us with geographic diversification
    in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of
    revenues and earnings. We believe our diversification strategy
    helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic
    cycles and enhances our long-term potential.

Economies
    of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in
    terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2007. By the same
    measure, we are also either the largest or one of the five
    largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2007. We
    believe that our national, regional and local scale of
    operations has provided us with benefits that may not be
    available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders,
    such as:

•

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national,
    regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates
    from certain subcontractors;

•

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative costs, which
    allows us greater flexibility to compete for greater market
    share in each of our markets;

•

Efficient land entitlement processes, as we often dedicate
    full-time staff to work with municipalities to resolve difficult
    land and lot entitlement concerns; and

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong
    balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships
    with national commercial and investment banking institutions.

Decentralized
    Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating
    flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key
    operating decisions. At September 30, 2007, we had 38
    separate homebuilding operating divisions, some of which are in
    the same market area and some of which operate in more than one
    market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a
    division president; land entitlement, acquisition and
    development personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel; a
    construction manager and construction superintendents; customer
    service personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager and office
    staff. We believe that division presidents and their management
    teams, who are familiar with local conditions, generally have
    better information on which to base decisions regarding local
    operations. Our division presidents receive performance bonuses
    based upon achieving targeted financial and operational measures
    in their operating divisions.



Operating
    Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other
    governmental requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite
    work required to meet local building codes;

•

Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction
    approvals;

•

Overseeing land development;

•

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•

Selecting and managing construction subcontractors and suppliers;

•

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules; and

•

Developing and implementing marketing plans.

Centralized
    Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business
    through our regional and corporate offices. We have seven
    separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional
    office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief
    financial officer, a purchasing manager and limited office
    support staff. Each of our region presidents and their
    management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations
    of up to seven homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Allocation of inventory investments within corporate guidelines;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division president
    compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are
    responsible for establishing our operational policies and
    internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with
    established policies and controls throughout our operations. The
    corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct
    management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through
    the following centralized functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to
    regional homebuilding operations;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Accounting and management reporting;

•

Internal audit;

•

Information technology systems;



•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Management of major national or regional supply chain
    initiatives;

•

Monitoring and analysis of margins, returns and
    expenses; and

•

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of
    results.

Cost
    Management

We control our overhead costs by centralizing certain
    administrative and accounting functions and by closely
    monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management
    positions in our operating divisions, as well as in our regional
    and corporate offices. We also minimize advertising costs by
    participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real
    estate brokers.

We control construction costs by striving to design our homes
    efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction
    materials and labor. We also negotiate favorable pricing from
    our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of
    services and products we purchase from them on a local, regional
    and national basis. We monitor our construction costs on each
    house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems,
    and we monitor our inventory levels, margins, returns and
    expenses through our management information systems.

Acquisitions

We are currently focused on strengthening our balance sheet and
    increasing our liquidity. However, we will continue to evaluate
    opportunities for strategic acquisitions. We believe that the
    current housing industry downturn may provide us selected
    opportunities to enhance our operations through the acquisition
    of existing homebuilding companies at attractive valuations. In
    certain instances, such acquisitions can provide us benefits not
    found in

start-up

operations, such as: established land positions and inventories;
    and existing relationships with municipalities, land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers. We seek to limit the
    risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting
    extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each
    acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we
    believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an
    acceptable period of time.



Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic
    regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our
    mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our
    homebuilding operating segments are our homebuilding reportable
    regions and are comprised of the following markets:

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for
    purposes of capital allocation, we consider the following local,
    market-specific factors, among others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Job growth;

•

Median income level of potential homebuyers;

•

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products
    utilized;

•

Land availability;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

New home sales activity;

•

Competition;

•

Secondary home sales activity; and

•

Prevailing housing products, features and pricing.

Land
    Policies

Typically, we acquire land after we have completed appropriate
    due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights
    (“entitlements”) to begin development or construction
    work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots.
    Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other
    things, complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests,
    independent environmental studies and other engineering work,
    and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other
    governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
    property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop
    land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we also
    sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain
    the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots
    at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
    anticipated home closings or planned land development. Our
    option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our
    financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and
    lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred
    by us. This enables us to control significant land and lot
    positions with limited capital investment, which substantially
    reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development.

Almost all of our land positions are acquired directly by us. We
    avoid entering into joint venture arrangements due to their
    increased costs and complexity, as well as the loss of
    operational control inherent in such arrangements. We are a
    party to a very small number of joint ventures that were
    acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders. All of
    these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial
    statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory
    risks by:

•

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned)
    in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing
    preferences and related economic developments, such as new job
    opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income
    trends;

•

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•

Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts,
    where possible;

•

Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional
    upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s
    receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory
    deposits from the buyer; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes
    under construction without an executed sales contract) built in
    each subdivision.



Construction

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets
    to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each
    community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features
    to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to
    allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold.

Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
    subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are retained for a
    specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
    subcontractor to complete construction at an

agreed-upon

price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use
    generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with
    other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials
    and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ construction
    superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate
    in major design and building decisions, coordinate the
    activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of
    subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor
    compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our
    construction superintendents play a significant role in working
    with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home
    modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction
    process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Construction time for our homes depends on the weather,
    availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home,
    and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a
    home within four to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of
    construction materials, except for work in progress materials
    for homes under construction. Generally, the construction
    materials used in our operations are readily available from
    numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
    certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
    at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
    have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of
    materials or labor that have materially affected our
    consolidated operating results.

Marketing
    and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and
    independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales
    from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each
    subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for
    sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel
    assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor
    plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting
    them with the selection of options and other custom features. We
    train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of
    financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising
    plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential
    homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives,
    including discounts and free upgrades, to be competitive in a
    particular market. In the current weak market conditions, we
    have significantly increased the level of incentives we are
    offering to homebuyers in most markets.

We advertise in our local markets as necessary through
    newspapers, marketing brochures and newsletters. We also use
    billboards, radio and television advertising and our Internet
    website to market the location, price range and availability of
    our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate
    in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take
    advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe that model
    homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, so we
    expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in
    our model homes.

In addition to using model homes, in certain markets we build a
    limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision. These
    homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective
    homebuyers who are relocating to these markets, as well as to
    independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a
    completed home within 60 days. We determine our speculative
    homes strategy in each market based on local market factors,
    such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing
    demand, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends
    and our past experience in the market. We determine the number
    of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our
    then current and planned sales pace, and we



monitor and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing
    basis as conditions warrant. We typically have sold a
    substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are
    under construction or soon after completion; however, the
    softness in our housing markets and related high cancellation
    rates during fiscal 2006 and 2007 have caused our speculative
    homes inventory to remain higher than our target levels. While
    we plan to reduce both total and speculative homes in inventory
    from current levels, we do expect to maintain a level of
    speculative home inventory in our markets to be in line with our
    expectations of future sales and closings volume. We believe
    these speculative homes help to provide us with opportunities to
    sell additional homes, reduce our inventory and generate
    positive cash flows.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least
    $500. The amount of earnest money required varies between
    markets and subdivisions, and may significantly exceed $500.
    Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional
    deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their
    homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers
    cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain
    their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating
    divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits. Our sales
    contracts also include a financing contingency which permits
    customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if
    they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified
    interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may
    include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing
    home. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of
    sales contracts in fiscal 2007 were 38%, and our cancellation
    rate in the fourth quarter was 48%. These cancellation rates are
    significantly higher than our typical historical rate of
    approximately 20%, reflecting the current weak housing market
    conditions. The length of time between the signing of a sales
    contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer
    (closing) averages from two to six months.

Customer
    Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality
    control inspections and responding to customers’
    post-closing needs. We believe that prompt and courteous
    response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction
    reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for
    quality and service, and ultimately leads to significant repeat
    and referral business from the real estate community and
    homebuyers. We provide our homebuyers with a limited one-year
    warranty on workmanship and building materials. The
    subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide
    us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to
    respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In
    addition, we typically provide a supplemental ten-year limited
    warranty that covers major construction defects, and some of our
    suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified
    products installed in the home.

Customer
    Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage
    coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction by
    ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that
    closings take place in a timely and efficient manner. DHI
    Mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of
    our homebuyers and, when necessary to fulfill the needs of some
    homebuyers, also brokers loans to third-party lenders who
    directly originate the mortgage loans. During the year ended
    September 30, 2007, approximately 95% of DHI
    Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our
    homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage provided mortgage
    financing services for approximately 66% of our total homes
    closed.

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI
    Mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be
    sold to third-party investors. DHI Mortgage does not seek to
    service the loans it originates, but rather packages and sells
    the loans and their servicing rights to third-party investors
    shortly after origination on a limited recourse basis, generally
    limited to early payment defaults or fraud and
    misrepresentation. In markets where we currently do not provide
    mortgage financing, we work with a variety of mortgage lenders
    that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing
    programs.



Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title
    insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance
    policies, examination and closing services to purchasers of
    homes we build and sell. We currently assume little or no
    underwriting risk associated with these title policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2007, we employed 6,231 persons, of
    whom 1,229 were sales and marketing personnel, 2,031 were
    executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 1,869 were
    involved in construction and 1,102 worked in mortgage and title
    operations. We had fewer than 20 employees covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. Employees of some of the
    subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or
    are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
    our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in
    each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and
    local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw
    materials, skilled labor and financing. We also compete with
    resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market.
    Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design,
    mortgage financing terms and location. In the current soft
    housing conditions, competition among homebuilders has greatly
    intensified, especially as to pricing and incentives, as
    builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the slowdown
    in housing demand. Our financial services business competes with
    other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local
    mortgage bankers and other financial institutions, some of which
    have greater access to capital markets, different lending
    criteria and potentially broader product offerings.

Governmental
    Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex
    regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
    zoning, density and development requirements, building,
    environmental, advertising and real estate sales rules and
    regulations. These requirements affect the development process,
    as well as building materials to be used, building designs and
    minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by
    local authorities where required, and homes eligible for
    insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA are subject
    to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad
    discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In
    addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various
    assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public
    improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of
    local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
    vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
    the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.

Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also
    comply with various federal and state laws and regulations.
    These include eligibility and other requirements for
    participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, GNMA,
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These also include required
    compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations
    such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against
    discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. All of
    these laws and regulations may subject our operations to
    examination by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. In prior
    years, we generally had more homes under construction, closed
    more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the
    third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal
    activity



increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding
    operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and
    increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we
    originated in our financial services segment at the end of these
    quarters. As a result of seasonal activity, our results of
    operations and financial position at the end of a particular
    fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance
    of our fiscal year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further
    deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during fiscal
    2007, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and
    fourth fiscal quarters. These results were primarily due to
    recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges.
    Also, the increasingly challenging market conditions caused
    further weakening in sales volume, pricing and margins as the
    fiscal year progressed. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

should be read together with the risk factors set forth below.
    They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or
    may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with
    other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the
    potential to affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material
    and adverse manner.

The
    homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn, and
    its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain. Further
    deterioration in industry conditions or in the broader economic
    conditions of the markets where we operate could further
    decrease demand and pricing for new homes and have additional
    adverse effects on our operations and financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly
    affected by changes in industry conditions, as well as in
    general and local economic conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

consumer confidence;

•

levels of new and existing homes for sale;

•

demographic trends; and

•

housing demand.

These may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the
    regions or markets in which we operate more than others. When
    adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets, they have a
    proportionately greater impact on us than on some other
    homebuilding companies. Our operations in previously strong
    markets, particularly California, Florida and Nevada, where we
    have significant inventory, have more adversely affected our
    financial results than our other markets in the current downturn.

An oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as existing
    homes, including homes held for sale by investors and
    speculators, foreclosed homes, and rental properties, can also
    reduce our ability to sell new homes and depress new home prices
    and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes.

During fiscal 2007, the already difficult conditions within the
    industry became progressively more challenging as demand for new
    homes continued to decline in most of our markets. The slowing
    demand, combined with the continued elevation in our sales
    cancellation rate, caused our sales results to be significantly
    below expectations. Also, our gross profit from home sales
    revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of
    incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand
    in our communities.



We believe that housing market conditions will continue to be
    challenging and may deteriorate further. We cannot predict the
    duration or ultimate severity of these challenging conditions.

The
    reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the
    volatility and reduction in liquidity in the financial markets
    have adversely affected our business, and the duration and
    ultimate severity of the effects are uncertain.

During fiscal 2007, the mortgage lending industry experienced
    significant instability due to, among other things, defaults on
    subprime loans and a resulting decline in the market value of
    such loans. In light of these developments, lenders, investors,
    regulators and other third parties questioned the adequacy of
    lending standards and other credit requirements for several loan
    programs made available to borrowers in recent years. This has
    led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and
    mortgage-backed securities, tightened credit requirements,
    reduced liquidity and increased credit risk premiums. A
    deterioration in credit quality among subprime and other
    nonconforming loans has caused almost all lenders to eliminate
    subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not
    conforming loans, FHA/VA-eligible loans or jumbo loans (which
    meet conforming underwriting guidelines other than loan size).
    Fewer loan products and tighter loan qualifications in turn make
    it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of
    our homes and for some buyers of existing homes from our move-up
    buyers to finance the purchase of the move-up buyer’s
    existing home. These factors have served to reduce the pool of
    qualified homebuyers and made it more difficult to sell to first
    time and first time

move-up

buyers which have long made up a substantial part of our
    customers. These reductions in demand have adversely affected
    our operations and financial results, and the duration and
    severity of the effects are uncertain.

We believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie
    Mac to the mortgage industry is very important to the housing
    market. These entities have recently reported losses as a result
    of deteriorating housing and credit market conditions. These
    losses have reduced their equity, which may limit their ability
    to acquire mortgages. The federal government recently sought to
    limit the size of the home-loan portfolios and operations of
    these government-sponsored enterprises. Any limitations or
    restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the
    liquidity provided by them could adversely affect interest
    rates, mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and
    mortgage loans.

Our
    strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the
    homebuilding industry have had limited success, and the
    continued implementation of these and other strategies may not
    be successful.

While we have been successful in generating positive operating
    cash flow and reducing our inventories in fiscal 2007, we have
    done so at significantly reduced gross profit levels and have
    incurred significant asset impairment charges. These have
    contributed to the net loss we recognized in fiscal 2007. Also,
    in fiscal 2007, notwithstanding our sales strategies, we
    continued to experience an elevated rate of sales contract
    cancellations. We believe that the increase in the cancellation
    rate is largely due to a decrease in homebuyer confidence, due
    principally to continued price declines and increases in the
    level of sales incentives for both new and existing homes. A
    more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability
    of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted
    cancellations. Many of the factors that affect new sales and
    cancellation rates are beyond our control. It is uncertain how
    long the reduction in sales and the increased level of
    cancellations will continue.

The
    homebuilding industry continues to be cyclical and affected by
    changes in general economic, real estate or other business
    conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial
    results.

Inventory Risks.

Inventory risks are
    substantial for our homebuilding business. The risks inherent in
    controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as
    consumer demand for housing decreases. Thus, we may have
    acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we
    will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build
    and sell homes profitably. Our deposits for building lots
    controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk.
    The value of undeveloped land, building lots and housing
    inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of
    changing market conditions. In addition, inventory carrying
    costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or
    losses in a poorly performing project or market. In the



present weak market conditions, we have sold homes and land for
    lower profit margins than in the past and we have recorded
    significant inventory impairment charges.

Historically, our goals for years of supply for ownership and
    control of land and building lots were based on
    management’s expectations for future volume growth. In
    light of the much weaker market conditions encountered in fiscal
    2006, which further deteriorated in fiscal 2007, our
    expectations changed and we significantly slowed our purchases
    of land and lots as part of our strategy to reduce our inventory
    to better match our reduced rate of production. We terminated
    numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to these option
    contracts. We cannot make any assurances that the measures we
    employ to manage inventory risks and costs will be successful.

Supply Risks.

The homebuilding industry has
    from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can
    affect the cost or timing of construction, including:

•

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building
    at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers
    want to live;

•

shortages of qualified trades people;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, who may be inadequately
    capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly
    increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are
    significant components of home construction costs.

Risks from Nature.

Weather conditions and
    natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes,
    wildfires, volcanic activity, droughts, and floods, can harm our
    homebuilding business. These can delay home closings, adversely
    affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or damage
    homes under construction. The climates and geology of many of
    the states in which we operate, including California, Florida
    and Texas, where we have some of our larger operations, present
    increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster.

Risks Related to National Security.

Continued
    military deployments in the Middle East and other overseas
    regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to
    national security, and any corresponding response by the United
    States or others, or related domestic or international
    instability, may adversely affect general economic conditions or
    cause a slowdown of the national economy.

Consequences.

As a result of the foregoing
    matters, potential customers may be less able or willing to buy
    our homes, or we may take longer or incur more costs to build
    them. Because of current market conditions, we have not been
    able to recapture any increased costs by raising prices. In the
    future, our ability to do so may also be limited by market
    conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery
    by signing home sales contracts. We may be unable to change the
    mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to
    maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market
    conditions in other ways. In addition, cancellations of home
    sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or
    do not honor their contracts.

Our financial services business is closely related to our
    homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans
    principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in
    the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may
    also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of
    our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages
    we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the
    mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages
    or may increase our repurchase obligations for previous
    originations.



Increases
    in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or
    increases in other costs of owning a home could prevent
    potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect
    our business or our financial results. During fiscal 2007, we
    experienced a reduction in the mortgage financing available to
    our customers.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through
    lenders providing mortgage financing. Prior to the recent
    volatility in the financial markets, interest rates were at
    historical lows and a variety of mortgage products were
    available. As a result, homeownership became more accessible.
    The mortgage products available included features that allowed
    buyers to obtain financing for a significant portion, up to all,
    of the purchase price of the home, had very limited underwriting
    requirements or provided for lower initial monthly payments. As
    a result, more people were able to qualify for mortgage
    financing. During fiscal 2007, there was a significant decrease
    in the type of mortgage products available and a general
    increase in the qualification requirements for mortgages such
    that fewer people are able to qualify for and obtain mortgage
    financing. This, coupled with higher mortgage interest rates has
    reduced demand for new homes.

Some of our homebuyers use down payment assistance programs,
    which allow homebuyers to receive gift funds from non-profit
    corporations to be used as a down payment. Homebuilders are a
    source of funding for these programs. The Department of Housing
    and Urban Development (HUD) and Congress are considering
    limitations and further regulation of these programs. New
    restrictions may limit the ability of seller-funded non-profit
    corporations to fund down payment assistance programs for
    government-insured mortgage loans. HUD has issued a rule that
    eliminates seller-funded down payment assistance as an
    acceptable minimum investment in the property for FHA insured
    loans. However, the implementation of that rule has been delayed
    as a result of litigation filed by certain down payment
    assistance providers. The ultimate outcome of this litigation is
    uncertain. If, as a result of legislative, regulatory or other
    action, the gift fund programs that some of our customers use
    would no longer be available to them, we would expect to seek
    other financing alternatives, and seek different down payment
    programs for those customers who meet applicable guidelines.
    There can be no assurance, however, that any such alternative
    programs would be as attractive to our customers as the programs
    offered today and that our sales would not suffer.

We believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage
    financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes.
    Any limitations or restrictions on the availability of the
    financing provided by them could adversely affect interest
    rates, mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and
    mortgage loans.

Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in
    interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing
    products may make it harder for them to sell their current homes
    to potential buyers who need financing.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage
    interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible
    expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases
    state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under
    current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state
    government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed,
    to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax
    deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home could
    increase for many of our potential customers. The resulting loss
    or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law
    changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, could
    adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes.

These matters may adversely affect the sales or pricing of our
    homes and may also reduce the volume or margins in our financial
    services business. The impact on our financial services business
    may be compounded to the extent we are unable to match interest
    rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate
    through the various hedging strategies we employ.

Governmental
    regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability
    of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our
    related financial services operations and adversely affect our
    business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect
    land development and home construction, including zoning,
    density restrictions, building design and building standards.
    These regulations often provide



broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities
    as to the conditions we must meet prior to being approved, if
    approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these
    authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities,
    roads or other local services. In addition, in many markets
    government authorities have implemented no growth or growth
    control initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay or increase
    the costs of development or home construction.

New housing developments may be subject to various assessments
    for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements, which
    could cause an increase in the total cost of homeownership. In
    addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental
    authorities, as experienced in response to reduced federal and
    state funding, can adversely affect the ability of potential
    customers to obtain financing or their desire to purchase new
    homes.

We are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending
    upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties
    and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped
    land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters
    may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial
    compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can
    prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding
    activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous
    federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include
    eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan
    programs, compliance with consumer lending and similar
    requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions
    against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures.
    They may also subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies. These factors may limit our ability to
    provide mortgage financing or title services to potential
    purchasers of our homes.

Our
    substantial debt could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30,
    2007, our consolidated debt was $4,376.8 million. In the
    ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional
    debt, to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facility,
    our indentures and the credit facilities of our financial
    services subsidiaries.

Possible Consequences.

The amount of our debt
    could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements or other requirements;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payment of our debt and reduce our ability to
    use our cash flow for other purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the
    changes in our business;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt
    than some of our competitors; and

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business or in general economic conditions.

Dependence on Future Performance.

Our ability
    to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon
    our future financial performance. We are engaged in businesses
    that are substantially affected by changes in industry and
    economic conditions. Our revenues and earnings vary with the
    level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our
    businesses are also affected by financial, political, business
    and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
    factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect
    our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through
    the sale of debt or equity securities, the refinancing of debt,
    or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may
    affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations, because
    borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating
    rates and our interest rate swap agreements fix our interest
    rate for only a portion of these borrowings.

As of September 30, 2007, the scheduled maturities of
    principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent
    12 months totaled $631.2 million, including
    $387.8 million in financial services debt that must be
    renewed annually. Based on the current level of operations, we
    believe our cash flow from operations, available cash,



available borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability
    to access the capital markets and to refinance or renew our
    facilities in a timely manner will be adequate to meet our
    future cash needs. We cannot, however, make any assurances that
    in the future our business will generate sufficient cash flow
    from operations or that borrowings or access to the capital
    markets or refinancing or renewal facilities will be available
    to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our
    indebtedness or to fund other cash needs.

Indenture and Credit Facility
    Restrictions.

Our revolving credit facility and
    the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose
    restrictions on our operations and activities. The most
    significant restrictions relate to limits on investments, cash
    dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments,
    incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens and asset
    dispositions, and require maintenance of a maximum leverage
    ratio, a minimum ratio of earnings before interest, income
    taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest incurred,
    minimum levels of tangible net worth and compliance with other
    financial covenants. In addition, the indentures governing our
    senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of liens. If we
    fail to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants, the
    trustees, the noteholders or the lending banks, as applicable,
    could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to
    maturity. In addition, if the margins by which we meet the
    financial covenants in our revolving credit facility are reduced
    significantly in the future, we or our lenders may seek to
    negotiate revised terms for the facility that could increase the
    cost, reduce the availability or change other conditions of the
    facility.

The credit facilities of our financial services subsidiaries
    also require the maintenance of minimum levels of tangible net
    worth, ratio of debt to tangible net worth and net income. A
    failure to comply with these requirements could allow the
    lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to the
    financial services subsidiaries or cause their debt to become
    due and payable prior to maturity.

Change in Debt Rating.

Until November 2007, we
    had investment grade ratings on our senior debt from all three
    of the major rating agencies. In November one of the agencies
    lowered our rating below investment grade while another placed
    us on watch for a possible downgrade from investment grade. The
    third agency has a negative outlook on its investment grade
    rating of our debt. If we do not maintain our investment grade
    credit ratings from both of the remaining agencies, available
    credit under our revolving credit facility is subject to
    limitations based on specified percentages of unsold homes,
    developed lots and lots under development included in inventory
    and the amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness and the
    cost of such capital may increase. Further, the loss of our
    investment grade rating can make accessing the public debt
    markets more difficult and expensive.

Change of Control Purchase Options.

If a
    change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing
    many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes,
    constituting $1.9 billion principal amount in the aggregate
    as of September 30, 2007, we would be required to offer to
    purchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount, together
    with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moreover, a change
    of control may also result in the acceleration of our revolving
    credit facility and our financial services credit facilities. If
    purchase offers were required under the indentures for these
    notes or these credit facilities were accelerated, we can give
    no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the
    amounts that we would be required to purchase or repay. At
    September 30, 2007, we did not have sufficient funds
    available to purchase or pay all of such outstanding debt upon a
    change of control.

Impact of Financial Services Debt.

Our
    financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries
    that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit
    facility. The ability of our financial services subsidiaries to
    provide funds to our homebuilding operations, however, is
    subject to restrictions in their own credit facilities. These
    funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and
    during the continuance of defaults under these facilities.
    Moreover, our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries
    upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the
    prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims
    we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to
    subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such
    indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as
    senior to our claims.



Homebuilding
    and financial services are very competitive, and competitive
    conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders
    compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable
    properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We
    compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders,
    often within larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed
    by such homebuilders. We also compete with existing home sales
    and rental properties. The competitive conditions in the
    homebuilding industry can result in:

•

lower sales;

•

lower selling prices;

•

increased selling incentives;

•

lower profit margins;

•

impairments in the value of our inventory, goodwill and other
    assets;

•

difficulty in effecting our strategies to reduce inventory;

•

difficulty in acquiring suitable land, raw materials, and
    skilled labor at acceptable prices; or

•

delays in construction of our homes;

Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks
    and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders with greater
    access to capital markets or different lending criteria may be
    able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers.

When we are affected by these competitive conditions, our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected. In
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, the reactions
    of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our
    efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory
    levels.

Our
    future operations may require additional capital, which may not
    be available.

Our operations require significant amounts of cash. We may be
    required to seek additional capital, whether from sales of
    equity, debt issuances or additional bank borrowings, for our
    business. We can give no assurance as to the availability of
    such additional capital or, if available, whether it would be on
    terms acceptable to us. Moreover, the indentures for our
    outstanding public debt and the covenants of our credit
    facilities contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may
    incur in the future. If we are not successful in obtaining
    sufficient capital, it could reduce the level of our business
    and may adversely affect our financial results.

We
    cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies
    will be successful.

Since 1993, we acquired many homebuilding companies. Although we
    focused on internal growth in recent years, we may make
    strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future.
    Successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of
    operations and management and other efforts to realize the
    benefits that may be available. Although we believe that we have
    been successful in doing so in the past, we can give no
    assurance that we would be able to identify, acquire and
    integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders
    if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our
    liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash. In
    addition, acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks,
    including the risk of writing off goodwill related to such
    acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the operating
    segments to which the acquired businesses were assigned. The
    risk of write-offs related to goodwill impairment increases
    during a cyclical housing downturn when profitability of our
    operating segments may decline, as evidenced by the goodwill
    impairment charges we recognized in fiscal 2007. Moreover, we
    may not be able to implement successfully our operating and
    future growth strategies within our existing markets.



Homebuilding
    is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in
    the ordinary course of business that can be
    significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and
    construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability
    insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from
    subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship
    and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for the
    homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and
    our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types
    of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these
    matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance
    coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will
    be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction
    defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be
    difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable
    self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
    covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits.
    Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of
    product liability insurance for construction defects are
    currently limited and costly. We have responded to increases in
    insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by
    increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There
    can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted
    or become more costly.

PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own
    several office buildings totaling approximately
    186,000 square feet and we lease approximately
    1,511,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring
    through January 2015, in our various operating markets to house
    our homebuilding and financial services operating divisions, as
    well as our regional and corporate offices.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the
    ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome of the
    lawsuits and contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the ultimate liability, if any, will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position or operations.

On June 15, 2007, a putative class action,

John R.
    Yeatman, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.

, was filed
    by one of our customers against us and our affiliated mortgage
    company subsidiary in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of Georgia. The complaint seeks certification
    of a class alleged to include persons who, within the year
    preceding the filing of the suit, purchased a home from us and
    obtained a mortgage for such purchase from our affiliated
    mortgage company subsidiary. The complaint alleges that we
    violated Section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
    Act by effectively requiring our homebuyers to use our
    affiliated mortgage company to finance their home purchases by
    offering certain discounts and incentives. The action seeks
    damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. We
    believe the claims alleged in this action are without merit and
    will defend them vigorously. However, as this action is still in
    its early stages, we are unable to express an opinion as to the
    likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the amount of damages,
    if any; consequently, we have not recorded any associated
    liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

As of November 16, 2007, the closing price of our common
    stock on the NYSE was $12.16, and there were approximately 642
    holders of record.

The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of
    our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
    future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our financial
    condition and general business conditions. We are required to
    comply with certain covenants contained in the bank agreements
    and our senior subordinated note indenture. In July 2007,
    through amendment to the revolving credit facility agreement, a
    restriction that limited our ability to pay cash dividends on
    our common stock in an amount, on a cumulative basis, not to
    exceed 50% of consolidated net income was removed. Under the
    amended agreement, payment of dividends is permitted provided
    there is no payment default under the facility, we are in
    compliance with certain financial covenants under the agreement,
    and such payments do not cause us not to be in compliance with
    those financial covenants. However, payment of cash dividends is
    still limited to the extent our total restricted payments are
    limited. At September 30, 2007, under the most restrictive
    debt covenants in effect, approximately $2.3 billion was
    available for all restricted payments.

The information required by this item with respect to equity
    compensation plans is set forth under Item 12 of this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

and is incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we did not sell any
    securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended.

In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock,
    replacing the previous common stock repurchase authorization.
    During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our
    common stock at a total cost of $36.8 million. In November
    2006, our Board of Directors extended the remaining
    $463.2 million common stock repurchase authorization to
    November 30, 2007. We made no repurchases of common stock
    under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2007, and
    therefore, all of the $463.2 million authorization was
    remaining at September 30, 2007. In November 2007, our
    Board of Directors extended the $463.2 million common stock
    repurchase authorization to November 30, 2008.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we repurchased
    2,433 shares of our common stock, representing shares
    delivered by employees to satisfy the exercise price of stock
    options as authorized by our 1991 Stock Incentive Plan. These
    shares were not purchased under our share repurchase program
    and, therefore, had no effect on the remaining stock repurchase
    authorization. There were no such transactions during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007.

In October 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board

No. 04-8,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
    Diluted Earnings per Share” (EITF

04-8).

EITF

04-8

requires that shares underlying contingently convertible debt be
    included in diluted earnings per share computations using the
    if-converted method regardless of whether the market price
    trigger or other contingent features have been met. The
    effective date for EITF

04-8

was for
    reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. EITF

04-8

also
    requires restatement of earnings per share amounts for prior
    periods presented during which the instrument was outstanding.
    In May 2001, we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes,
    which were converted into shares of our common stock in June
    2003. During certain quarters of the year ended
    September 30, 2003, the market price trigger was not met
    and the convertible shares were not included in the computation
    of diluted net income per share. The adoption of EITF

04-8

reduced
    our diluted net income per share for the year ended

    effects of the three-for-two common stock split, effected as a

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations — Fiscal Year 2007 Overview

Our fiscal 2007 results reflect the challenges that the
    homebuilding industry faced during the year. Fiscal 2006 marked
    the beginning of the current housing downturn, and in fiscal
    2007 the factors hurting demand for new homes persisted, grew in
    intensity and became more pervasive across the United States.
    Throughout the year, the already difficult conditions within the
    industry became progressively more challenging. High inventory
    levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation
    rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and
    overall weak consumer confidence persisted through the year. The
    effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in
    availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest
    rates on certain loan products, due to credit tightening in the
    mortgage markets. These factors, combined with our continued
    elevated sales cancellation rate, caused our sales volume to be
    significantly below expectations. Also, our gross profit from
    home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher
    levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to
    stimulate demand in our communities.

As we progressed though fiscal 2007, our disappointing sales
    results, further declines in our sales order prices, continued
    declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the
    more challenging market conditions caused us to have a more
    cautious outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on
    our business. We believe that housing market conditions will
    continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further, and that
    the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear.
    Our outlook incorporates several factors, including continued
    margin pressure from increased price reductions and sales
    incentives; continued high levels of new and existing homes
    available for sale; weak demand from new home consumers as they
    continue to see home prices adjust downward; continued high
    sales cancellations; continued weak housing affordability in
    many markets that experienced rapid price appreciation over the
    past few years; and permanent restrictions on the availability
    of certain mortgage products as a result of the recent credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets.

Due to the declining market conditions and our increased use of
    price reductions and sales incentives, we evaluated a
    significant portion of our inventory in our quarterly impairment
    analyses during fiscal 2007. Additionally, we evaluated the
    recoverability of our goodwill. Our goodwill and inventory
    impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued
    and increasing challenges in the homebuilding industry, and our
    belief that these challenging conditions may last longer and
    have a greater impact on our business than we previously
    believed. Based on our evaluations, we recorded significant
    impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill balances during
    the year, which resulted in a net loss for fiscal 2007.

Strategy

We believe the long-term fundamentals which support housing
    demand, namely population growth and household formation, remain
    solid. We also believe the current negative market conditions,
    the effects of which have been more severe and more prolonged
    than previously expected, will moderate over the long term. In
    the interim, we remain committed to the following initiatives
    related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding
    business environment:

•

Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by

—

constructing and selling homes,

—

opportunistically selling land and lots,

—

significantly restricting our spending for land and lot
    purchases,

—

decreasing our land development spending or in some instances,
    suspending development in certain projects until market
    conditions improve; and

—

renegotiating or canceling land option purchase contracts.

•

Reducing our inventory of homes under construction by limiting
    the construction of unsold homes.

•

Continuing to offer incentives and price reductions to increase
    sales as necessary to maximize returns and cash flows.



•

Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and
    subcontractors.

•

Continuing to modify our product offerings to provide more
    affordable homes.

•

Decreasing our SG&A infrastructure to be in line with our
    reduced expectations of production levels.

•

Reducing our level of debt by utilizing cash flows from
    operations.

These initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows
    from operations during fiscal 2007, which we utilized to reduce
    our outstanding debt by a substantial amount. Although we cannot
    provide any assurances that these initiatives will continue to
    be successful, we expect that our operating strategy will allow
    us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity
    position.

Results
    of Operations — Homebuilding

Our operating segments are our seven homebuilding operating
    regions, which we present as separate reportable segments.
    Previously, we presented six homebuilding reporting segments,
    aggregating both our Northeast and Midwest operating regions
    into our Northeast reporting segment. However, because of a
    realignment of our management structure during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, our Colorado markets are now included in
    our Midwest operating region, rather than in our Southwest
    operating region. As a result, we determined that each of our
    seven operating regions constitutes a reportable segment, as
    reflected in our current year presentation. All prior year
    segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal
    2007 presentation. These reporting segments, which we also refer
    to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in
    the following states:

Northeast:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona, New Mexico and Utah

California:

California and Nevada (Reno only)

West:

Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington

Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended

The following tables set forth key operating and financial data
    for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
    Based on our revised disaggregation of operating segments and
    the states within those segments, we have restated the 2006
    amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2007
    presentation.

Net
    Sales Orders and Backlog

Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new
    sales contracts executed with customers, net of sales contract
    cancellations. The value of net sales orders decreased 41%, to
    $8,230.6 million (33,687 homes) in 2007 from
    $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006. The value of net
    sales orders decreased 48%, to $1,309.5 million (6,374
    homes) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 from
    $2,532.2 million (10,430 homes) in the same period of
    fiscal 2006. The decreases in our net sales orders reflect the
    softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets.
    We believe the most significant factors contributing to the
    slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include
    an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a
    reduction in investor purchases, a decrease in the availability
    of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and a
    decline in homebuyer consumer confidence. Additionally, we
    believe that the rapid price appreciation of new and existing
    homes in many markets over the past several years has reduced
    the number of potential homebuyers able to afford a home. Many
    prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase
    decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price
    concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and
    existing homes, concern over their ability to sell an existing
    home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty
    surrounding the housing market. We have attempted to increase
    sales by providing increased sales incentives and lowering
    prices, but the factors above, combined with the continued
    pricing responses of our competitors, have limited the impact of
    our pricing efforts. Subsequent to fiscal year 2007, the volume
    of our net sales orders for the month ended October 31,
    2007 decreased 54% compared to the month ended October 31,
    2006.

In comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, the value of net sales
    orders decreased significantly in all seven of our market
    regions. These decreases were primarily due to similar decreases
    in the number of homes sold in each region, although in our
    Southeast, Southwest and California regions, a decline in
    average selling prices was also a significant factor. The
    decreases in average selling prices were primarily due to the
    increased use of price concessions and sales incentives and, to
    a lesser extent, a shift to more affordable products in those
    regions.

The most significant decline in net sales orders in fiscal 2007
    occurred in our California region, with 48% fewer homes sold
    than in fiscal 2006. We believe that home sales in our
    California markets have been negatively impacted, to a greater
    extent than our other regions, by a reduction in the pool of
    qualified buyers due to a lack of housing affordability and the
    decline of mortgage availability. We are closely monitoring, on
    a project by project basis, our products, pricing and other
    operational strategies in the California region. We will further
    modify product offerings and pricing as necessary, as we attempt
    to improve our sales in this region.

Our annual cancellation rate (sales orders cancelled divided by
    gross sales orders) was 38% in fiscal 2007, compared to 28% in
    fiscal 2006. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 was 48% and



cancellations in the month ended October 31, 2007 were at a
    similar rate. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal
    2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our
    Arizona, California and Florida markets. These elevated
    cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most
    homebuilding markets, including the inability of many
    prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes, the
    increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions
    in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further
    credit tightening in the mortgage markets. The impact of the
    credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in
    late August and continued through September and October as the
    mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer
    available or they could not qualify due to stricter underwriting
    guidelines.

The average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was
    $244,300, a decrease of 9% from the $267,300 average in fiscal
    2006. The average price of our net sales orders decreased
    significantly in our Southeast, Southwest and California
    regions, due primarily to price reductions and increased
    incentives in our Florida, Arizona and California markets. In
    general, our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes,
    and declines in our average selling prices during the year were
    due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions
    and sales incentives. Further, as the inventory of existing
    homes for sale has continued to rise, it has led to the need to
    ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable existing home
    sales prices. We continually monitor and may adjust our product
    mix, geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets
    in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for
    our target customer base, typically first-time and

move-up

homebuyers. To a lesser extent than the competitive factors
    discussed above, this has also contributed to decreases in the
    average selling price.

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet
    closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our
    sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including
    mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes,
    which can result in cancellations. Before the current housing
    downturn, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level
    of home closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters; however,
    due to our current elevated cancellation rates, higher level of
    unsold homes in inventory and difficult conditions in many of
    our markets, this relationship between backlog and future home
    closings may have changed.

At September 30, 2007, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes), a decrease of
    48% from $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes) at
    September 30, 2006. The average sales price of homes in
    backlog was $258,000 at September 30, 2007, down 10% from
    the $286,100 average at September 30, 2006. The value of
    our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our
    market regions, with the largest percentage decrease occurring
    in our California region.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales decreased 26%, to
    $10,721.2 million (41,370 homes closed) in 2007 from
    $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006. Revenues
    from home sales decreased in all seven of our market regions,
    led by the Midwest and California regions, with decreases of 41%
    and 40%, respectively. The average selling price of homes closed
    during 2007 was $259,200, down 5% from $273,900 in 2006. The
    decrease in our fiscal 2007 home sales revenues was the result
    of slowing demand and the resulting decline in net sales order
    volume and pricing during the year.

The number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22% due to
    decreases in six of our seven market regions. As a result of the
    decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in
    our sales order backlog, we expect to close fewer homes in
    fiscal 2008 than we did in fiscal 2007. As conditions change in
    the housing markets in which we operate, our ongoing level of
    net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and
    amount of revenue we will generate.

Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased
    by $58.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from
    changes in profit deferred pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 66, “Accounting for
    Sales of Real Estate.” The home sales profit related to our
    mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a
    buyer finances a home through our wholly-owned mortgage company
    and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as
    prescribed by SFAS No. 66. As of September 30,



2007, the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage
    loans held for sale was $32.6 million, compared to
    $90.6 million at September 30, 2006. The decline is
    attributable to both the drop in the number of homes closed and
    a decline in the availability of the mortgage types whose use
    generally resulted in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral.

Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82%, to
    $603.7 million in 2007 from $3,342.2 million in 2006.
    Including sales of both homes and land/lots, as well as
    impairment charges and land option cost write-offs, total
    homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues decreased 1,720 basis points, to 5.4% in 2007 from
    22.6% in 2006. Approximately 1,020 basis points of the
    decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges
    and land option cost write-offs. As a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues, these were 12.0% in fiscal 2007 versus 1.8% in fiscal
    2006.

Gross profit from home sales decreased by 47%, to
    $1,848.9 million in 2007, from $3,497.6 million in
    2006, and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased
    680 basis points, to 17.2%. The primary factor reducing our
    home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market
    conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our
    selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets,
    causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home
    sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due
    to the current sales environment in many of our markets, we have
    offered a variety of incentives and price concessions, which
    affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of
    the home or increasing the cost of the home without a
    proportional increase in the selling price. We are also offering
    greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of homes,
    which is at a higher than desired level. This strategy has
    helped reduce our total homes in inventory by approximately
    8,600 units from September 30, 2006, but has also
    contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit.
    Additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased
    approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the
    amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points
    due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses
    as a percentage of home sales revenues. These decreases were
    partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of
    20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the
    relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets,
    and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of
    $58.0 million of previously deferred gross profit in
    accordance with SFAS No. 66 during 2007, compared to
    $1.6 million in 2006.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” land
    inventory and related development costs are reviewed for
    potential write-downs when impairment indicators are present.
    SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is
    less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows
    are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and
    timing of revenues and costs and other factors which, in turn,
    are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions
    of competitors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination
    of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated
    cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks
    associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow
    streams.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges
    are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed
    projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these
    homes.

During fiscal 2007, the difficult conditions within the
    homebuilding industry became more challenging. High inventory
    levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation
    rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and
    overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year.
    The effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline
    in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage
    interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with
    our disappointing sales results, further declines in sales order
    prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales
    revenues throughout the year, caused our outlook for the
    homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become
    more cautious as the year progressed. Our current outlook is
    that we believe



housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and
    may deteriorate further, and that the timing of a recovery in
    the housing market remains unclear.

During fiscal 2007, our quarterly inventory impairment analyses
    performed in accordance with SFAS No. 144 utilized
    assumptions that incorporated our cautious outlook, which
    reflects the expectation that the challenging conditions in the
    homebuilding industry will persist and have a greater impact
    than we believed when the year began. Consequently, our strategy
    to reduce our inventory and lot position in a number of markets
    will likely take longer and require additional price concessions
    and incentives than previously anticipated. Therefore, our
    impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007
    indicated a significant number of projects with impairment
    indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of
    $2,622.4 million as of September 30, 2007, had
    indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for
    impairment. The analysis of each of these projects generally
    assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or
    lower than current sales order prices in each project or for
    comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable
    absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe
    for a given project in the current market conditions, we
    estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from
    six months to in excess of ten years. Through these evaluations,
    we determined that projects with a carrying value of
    $940.5 million as of September 30, 2007, the largest
    portions of which were in the California, West and Southeast
    regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007, we recorded impairment charges totaling
    $278.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired
    projects to their estimated fair value. These fourth quarter
    charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the
    year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of
    $1,222.2 million during fiscal 2007. Approximately 74% of
    these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and
    lots and land held for development, and approximately 26% of
    these charges were recorded to residential construction in
    progress and finished homes in inventory. During fiscal 2006, we
    recorded impairment charges totaling $146.2 million related
    to projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the
    majority of which were in California.

Of the remaining $1,681.9 million of such projects with
    impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired
    at September 30, 2007, the largest concentrations are in
    California (28%), Florida (20%), and Arizona (16%). It is
    possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these
    projects may change and could result in a future need to record
    impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value.
    Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry or
    specific markets in which we operate worsen in the future beyond
    current expectations, and as we re-evaluate specific project
    pricing and incentive strategies, we may be required to evaluate
    additional projects or re-evaluate previously impaired projects
    for potential impairment. These evaluations may result in
    additional impairment charges, and such charges could be
    material.

Based on a review of land and lot option contracts performed
    each quarter, we write off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts
    which we no longer plan to pursue. During fiscal 2007 and 2006,
    we wrote off $107.3 million and $124.7 million,
    respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to land purchase option contracts. Should the
    current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are
    unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase
    contracts, we may write off additional earnest money deposits
    and pre-acquisition costs.

The inventory impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding
    gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    approximately 1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007, compared
    to 180 basis points in fiscal 2006.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities decreased by
    $315.1 million, or 22%, to $1,141.5 million in 2007
    from $1,456.6 million in 2006. As a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues, SG&A expenses increased
    40 basis points, to 10.3% in 2007 from 9.9% in 2006, due to
    a decrease in revenues. The largest component of our
    homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 59% and 64% of SG&A costs in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased
    $260.2 million, or 28%, to $672.2 million in 2007 from
    $932.4 million in 2006, largely due to our continued
    efforts to align the number of employees to



match our current and anticipated home closing levels, as well
    as a decrease in incentive compensation, which is primarily
    based on profitability. Our homebuilding operations employed
    approximately 5,100 and 7,100 employees at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining
    decrease in SG&A of $54.9 million was primarily
    attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance,
    advertising costs and professional consulting fees.

We continue to adjust our SG&A infrastructure to support
    our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make assurances
    that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the
    current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues. If our
    volume of future home closings is lower than fiscal 2007 levels,
    our future SG&A percentage may increase further.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under
    construction or development. During both fiscal years, our
    inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt;
    therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt.
    Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written
    off with inventory impairment charges, was 2.4% of total home
    and land/lot cost of sales in 2007, compared to 2.1% in 2006.

Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of
    our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006, interest incurred related to
    homebuilding debt decreased by 6%, to $304.3 million,
    primarily due to a 5% decrease in our average homebuilding debt.

Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

In fiscal 2007, in connection with the early retirement of our
    8.5% senior notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of
    approximately $12.1 million for the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. In
    fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our
    9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our
    10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a
    loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium
    and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized
    premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded
    a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the
    unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement
    of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $4.0 million in 2007, compared
    to $11.0 million in 2006. Major components of other income
    in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of
    assets, while in fiscal 2006, the increase in the fair value of
    our interest rate swaps was also a major component.

Goodwill

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets,” we have restated our goodwill
    balances between reporting segments to reflect the revised
    aggregation of our operating regions that resulted from a
    realignment of our management structure during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007. Our Colorado markets, which were
    previously included in our Southwest operating region, are now
    included in our Midwest operating region. Consequently, we
    determined that our Midwest operating region, which was
    previously included in our Northeast reporting segment,
    constitutes a separate reporting segment. The following
    discussion of goodwill balances and related impairment charges
    is based on the revised alignment and disaggregation.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets
    acquired. We test goodwill for potential impairment annually as
    of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or
    circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of
    goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential
    impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a
    two-step process that begins with the estimation of the fair
    value of the



reporting units. If the results of the first step indicate that
    impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to
    measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is
    determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is
    less than its carrying value.

At June 30, 2007, we determined that an interim test to
    assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of
    the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under
    SFAS No. 144, the market conditions in the
    homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price. We
    completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as
    of June 30, 2007. We estimated the fair value of our
    reporting units primarily utilizing the expected present values
    of future cash flows, supported with a market based assessment
    of fair value for the reporting units, and concluded an
    impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated
    for operating regions within our Northeast, Southeast,
    California and West reporting segments. As a result, during the
    quarter ended June 30, 2007, we recorded non-cash
    impairment charges totaling $425.6 million related to the
    write-off of goodwill in these reporting segments.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we completed
    the second step of our goodwill impairment analyses, through
    which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter
    write-offs and determined that the goodwill balance related to
    our Midwest reporting segment was completely impaired.
    Consequently, the goodwill balance in our Midwest reporting
    segment of $48.5 million, which included $13.5 million
    transferred from the Southwest reporting segment due to changing
    our management structure, was written off in the fourth quarter.
    Total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were
    $474.1 million.

In addition, at September 30, 2007, we completed our annual
    impairment test and determined that the fair values of our South
    Central and Southwest reporting segments were greater than their
    carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those
    segments.

Reflecting the fiscal 2007 impairment charges and restatement of
    the prior year segment balances to conform to the current year
    presentation, our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

The goodwill assessment procedures of SFAS No. 142
    require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues
    and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such
    estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.
    Continued softness in the homebuilding industry may result in
    the determination that some or all of our remaining goodwill
    balance has become impaired, which could result in additional
    goodwill impairment charges.

Income
    Taxes

In fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was
    $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income
    taxes for the year. In fiscal 2006, the provision for income
    taxes was $753.8 million, corresponding to the income
    before income taxes for the year.



Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 25.1%,
    compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% in fiscal 2006. The
    effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax
    rate in 2006, resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes
    related to the loss in the year, because only approximately 23%
    of the $474.1 million goodwill impairment charge recorded
    in fiscal 2007 is deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the
    goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 40.9% for
    fiscal 2007.

Primarily as a result of recording significant inventory
    impairment charges during fiscal 2007, the balance of our
    deferred tax asset increased substantially. The net deferred tax
    asset of $863.8 million at September 30, 2007 assumes
    that we will be able to realize the full value of these assets,
    which will be dependent in part on our ability to generate
    sufficient profits in future periods. If market conditions
    within the homebuilding industry do not improve or continue to
    worsen, it may affect our ability to fully realize the value of
    these assets, which may require a valuation adjustment and
    additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of
    operations, and such expense could be material.

Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

Northeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 22% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 22%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region
    reported a loss before income taxes of $66.1 million in
    2007, compared to income of $112.9 million in 2006. The
    loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment
    charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs
    totaling $81.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $39.4 million. A decrease in the region’s core home
    sales gross profit percentage (home sales gross profit
    percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs) of 450 basis points in
    2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in
    income before income taxes. The core home sales gross profit
    percentage decline in our South Carolina and New Jersey markets
    had the greatest impact on the overall decrease in the
    region’s profitability.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 42%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a
    slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. The
    region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $205.3 million in 2007, compared to income of
    $111.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was
    primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money
    and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $167.3 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $48.5 million. The majority of the inventory impairments
    relate to projects in our Denver market. A decrease in the
    region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of
    210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006, as well as an
    increase in construction defect expense in Denver also
    contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 28% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 24%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 6% decrease
    in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported
    a loss before income taxes of $131.6 million in 2007,
    compared to income of $346.4 million in 2006. The loss in
    fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges
    and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $210.2 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $11.5 million. A decrease in the region’s core home
    sales gross profit percentage of 1,140 basis points in 2007
    compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income
    before income taxes. The core home sales gross profit percentage
    decline in our Florida markets had the greatest impact on the
    overall decrease. The Florida markets experienced rapid price
    increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit
    increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006.
    In 2007, high inventory levels of new and existing homes and
    increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions
    were typical throughout Florida, resulting in substantial gross
    profit declines.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 13% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 16%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a 5%
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was $122.2 million in
    2007, down 29% from 2006. Income before income taxes as a
    percentage of the region’s revenues (operating margin)
    decreased 130 basis points, to 6.1%, from 7.4% in 2006. The
    decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to



a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross profit
    percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The
    core home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening
    in the San Antonio market, where inventories of new and
    existing homes have increased, resulting in increased levels of
    sales incentives being offered by builders. The recording of
    inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $24.6 million in
    fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 million in 2006, also
    contributed to the decline in the region’s profitability.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    remained relatively flat, decreasing only 1% in 2007 compared to
    2006, due to a 6% decrease in the average selling price of homes
    closed, offset by a 5% increase in the number of homes closed.
    Income before income taxes for the region was
    $204.6 million in 2007, down 52% from 2006. Operating
    margin decreased 1,110 basis points, to 10.4%, from 21.5%
    in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily
    due to a decrease in the region’s core home sales gross
    profit percentage of 1,080 basis points in 2007 compared to
    2006. The core home sales gross profit change was largely due to
    declines in our Phoenix market. The Phoenix market experienced
    significant price increases in previous years which contributed
    to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross
    profit in 2006. In 2007, higher inventory levels of new and
    existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price
    reductions were more common in Phoenix, resulting in gross
    profit declines. The recording of inventory impairment charges
    and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $26.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $4.8 million
    in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the region’s
    profitability.

California Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 39% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $784.1 million in 2007, compared to
    income of $346.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007
    was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $564.6 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $300.3 million. All of our California markets have incurred
    inventory impairments, with a larger concentration attributable
    to our Southern California markets. A decrease in the
    region’s core home sales gross profit percentage of
    890 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed
    to the reduction in income before income taxes. Core home sales
    gross profit percentage declines in our Northern California
    markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease, as
    these formerly strong markets weakened in fiscal 2007 from 2006.
    Most of our California markets experienced rapid, significant
    home price increases in previous years which contributed to
    gross profit increases in 2005, but they also strained housing
    affordability for most potential homebuyers in California.
    Housing affordability remains an issue in California, and credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets has significantly limited the
    availability of many mortgage products used extensively by
    California homebuyers in recent years. In 2006 and 2007,
    increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions
    were typical throughout California as builders attempted to
    increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to
    address affordability concerns, resulting in gross profit
    declines.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    26% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 29% decrease in the
    number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $159.7 million in 2007, compared to
    income of $365.8 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007
    was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $254.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $74.4 million. The majority of the inventory impairments
    relate to projects in our Las Vegas market. A decrease in the
    region’s core home sales gross profit of 750 basis
    points in 2007, compared to 2006 also contributed to the
    reduction in income before income taxes. The core home sales
    gross profit percentage decline in our Las Vegas market had the
    greatest impact on the overall decrease. The Las Vegas market
    experienced rapid, significant home price increases in previous
    years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and
    continued elevated gross profit in 2006, but these price
    increases also strained housing affordability for many potential
    homebuyers there. Credit tightening in the mortgage markets has
    also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage
    products used extensively by Las Vegas homebuyers in recent
    years. In 2007, inventory levels of new and existing homes were
    high and increased levels of sales incentives and home price
    reductions were typical in Las Vegas new home communities, as
    builders attempted to increase demand for homes and address
    affordability concerns, resulting in gross profit declines.

Net
    Sales Orders and Backlog

The value of net sales orders decreased 5%, to
    $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006 from
    $14,643.4 million (53,232 homes) in 2005. The number of net
    sales orders decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005, reflecting the industry-wide softening of demand for new
    homes in most homebuilding markets, which began in fiscal 2006.
    Factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included an
    increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction
    in investor purchases, an increase in incentives offered by
    homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and an increase in
    sales contract cancellation rates. These factors affected our
    business most significantly in the fourth fiscal quarter, when
    our net sales orders decreased 25% compared to the same quarter
    of fiscal 2005.

Our annual cancellation rate increased to 28% in fiscal 2006,
    and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006
    increased to approximately 40%, exceeding our typical historical
    range of 16% to 20%. The higher overall cancellation rate for
    fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many
    of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. A significant
    portion of the increase in cancellations was due to our
    prospective homebuyers being unable to sell their existing homes.

Decreases in both the number and value of net sales orders in
    fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in our Northeast,
    Midwest, Southeast and California regions. The decreases in
    sales in these regions were primarily attributable to the
    changes in market conditions described above. Partially
    offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18% increase
    in net sales orders in our South Central region, where many of
    our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand
    during fiscal 2006.

The average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was
    $267,300, a decrease of 3% from the $275,100 average in fiscal
    2005. During the year, slight to moderate increases and
    decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions,
    resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005.
    In general, our ability to raise prices is dependent on the
    demand for our homes; therefore, the lack of any significant
    overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to
    the decrease in demand and our increased use of sales incentives
    in many markets. Particularly, the home price appreciation that
    occurred in many of our California, Arizona and Florida markets
    during fiscal 2005 moderated and, in many instances reversed,
    during fiscal 2006. As part of our efforts to keep our core
    product offerings affordable for our target customer base,
    adjustments to our product and geographic mix and pricing within
    our homebuilding markets also contributed to decreases in the
    average selling price.

At September 30, 2006, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes), down 11% from
    $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes) at September 30, 2005.
    The average sales price of homes in backlog was $286,100 at
    September 30, 2006, down 6% from the $303,200 average at
    September 30, 2005. The value of our sales order backlog
    decreased in five of our seven market regions, led by decreases
    of 46% and 30% in our Midwest and Southeast regions,
    respectively, which is reflective of the difficult sales



environment. The average selling price of homes in backlog at
    September 30, 2006 as compared to September 30, 2005
    reflected only slight to moderate increases and decreases among
    our regions.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales increased 9%, to $14,545.4 million
    (53,099 homes closed) in 2006 from $13,376.6 million
    (51,172 homes closed) in 2005. Revenues from home sales
    increased in all seven of our market regions, led by the
    Northeast, Southwest and Southeast regions, with increases of
    25%, 15% and 13%, respectively. The average selling price of
    homes closed during 2006 was $273,900, up 5% from $261,400 in
    2005. The average selling price of homes closed increased by
    slight to moderate amounts in six of our seven market regions,
    led by the Southwest and Southeast regions with increases of 17%
    and 11%, respectively. Many markets, especially some of the
    California, Arizona and Florida markets which experienced the
    most price appreciation during fiscal 2005, experienced
    weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal 2006, resulting in
    declines in total and per home revenue. As reflected in our net
    sales order volume, demand slowed in a number of our markets
    during fiscal 2006, and in general, we offered more incentives
    and price concessions to obtain home sales. Revenues from home
    sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by $1.6 million, while
    revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by
    $92.2 million, from changes in profit deferred pursuant to
    SFAS No. 66.

Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4%, to
    $3,342.2 million in 2006 from $3,488.3 million in
    2005. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total
    homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues decreased 300 basis points, to 22.6% in 2006 from
    25.6% in 2005.

Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales
    revenues decreased 150 basis points, to 24.0% in 2006 from
    25.5% in 2005. The primary factors reducing our home sales gross
    profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed
    above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and
    costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline
    of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross
    margin. In fiscal 2006, we had to utilize additional incentives
    in many of our markets due to the challenging sales environment.
    Sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the
    selling price of the home, or by increasing the cost of the home
    without a proportional increase in the selling price. An
    additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin
    decline was a result of the decrease in the relative number of
    closings in markets such as California and Nevada, which had
    significant price appreciation in preceding years and,
    therefore, had above average gross margins in fiscal 2005. These
    declines were partially offset by an improvement of
    approximately 55 basis points related to the increase in
    home sales revenues and gross profit from the recognition of
    profit previously deferred in accordance with
    SFAS No. 66. The remaining improvement of
    40 basis points was primarily due to a reduction in
    warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of
    home sales revenues.

During fiscal 2006, several communities under development that
    demonstrated potential impairment indicators, with a combined
    carrying value of $739.5 million at September 30,
    2006, were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. Our analyses of these projects generally
    assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared with current sales
    orders for the particular project or revenues realized from
    comparable projects. We determined that projects with a carrying
    value of $459.3 million, the majority of which were in
    California, were impaired. Consequently, we recorded impairment
    charges of $146.2 million to reduce the carrying value of
    the impaired projects to their estimated fair value.

During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we wrote off $124.7 million
    and $17.1 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits
    and pre-acquisition costs related to land purchase option
    contracts which we determined we would not pursue. The inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as
    a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately
    180 basis points in fiscal 2006.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by
    $230.0 million, or 19%, to $1,456.6 million in 2006
    from $1,226.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenues,
    SG&A expenses increased 90 basis points,



to 9.9% in 2006 from 9.0% in 2005. The largest component of our
    homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 64% and 67% of SG&A costs in 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased
    $115.1 million, or 14%, to $932.4 million in 2006 from
    $817.3 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of
    employees to support our previously planned growth. The
    remaining increase in SG&A of $114.9 million was
    primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs,
    property taxes, rent expense and subdivision maintenance. These
    increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the
    competitive selling environment.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under
    construction or development. During both fiscal years, our
    inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt;
    therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt.
    Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest
    impaired, was 2.1% of total home and land/lot cost of sales in
    2006, compared to 2.2% in 2005.

Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of
    our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2006 with fiscal 2005, interest incurred related to
    homebuilding debt increased by 19%, to $325.4 million, due
    to a 34% increase in our average homebuilding debt. Interest
    incurred increased at a slower rate than our debt primarily
    because our debt during 2006 was more heavily weighted to our
    revolving credit facility, which carried a lower interest rate
    than the weighted average interest rate of our senior and senior
    subordinated notes. Our efforts to replace older, higher
    interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also
    contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs.

Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our
    9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our
    10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a
    loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium
    and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized
    premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded
    a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the
    unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement
    of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005,
    in connection with the early retirement of our
    9.375% senior notes due 2009, we recorded interest expense
    of approximately $4.4 million for the call premium and
    unamortized fees, net of the unamortized premium related to
    these redeemed notes.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $11.0 million in 2006, compared
    to $15.7 million in 2005. The major component of other
    income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value
    of our interest rate swaps of $3.1 million and
    $9.5 million, respectively. Also included in other income
    in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of $6.9 million and
    $3.9 million, respectively.

Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

Northeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 24% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 20%
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was 17% lower in 2006
    compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, decreased 400 basis points to 8.1%, from 12.1% in
    2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s
    core home sales gross profit percentage (home sales gross profit
    percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs), with the gross margin declines
    in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets having the greatest
    impact on the overall decrease. Additionally, profitability was
    negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment
    charges and land option cost write-offs of $26.9 million in
    fiscal 2006 versus $0.4 million in fiscal 2005.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 6% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 5%
    increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well
    as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income
    before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between
    the two years, and as a



percentage of the region’s revenues, it decreased
    30 basis points to 6.2%, from 6.5% in 2005. This decrease
    was due to the effect of recording of inventory impairment
    charges and land option cost write-offs of $32.5 million in
    fiscal 2006 versus $1.9 million in fiscal 2005, largely
    offset by an increase in land sales gross profit and gross
    profit related to the recognition of profit previously deferred
    in accordance with SFAS No. 66.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 12% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an 11%
    increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well
    as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income
    before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between
    the two years; however, as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, it decreased 250 basis points to 17.0%, from
    19.5% in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in
    the region’s gross profit percentage, which was negatively
    affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and
    land option cost write-offs of $34.4 million in fiscal 2006
    versus $3.8 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding these
    charges, we experienced similar core home sales gross profit
    margins in both fiscal years; however, we did experience a sharp
    decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006,
    reflecting the softening market conditions, especially in
    Florida.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 9% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was 26% higher in 2006
    compared to 2005, and as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, increased 100 basis points to 7.4%, from 6.4% in
    2005. This increase in income before income taxes was primarily
    due to a decrease in the region’s selling, general and
    administrative costs as a percentage of revenues, as gross
    margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal
    2006.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 17% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to a 17% increase in
    the average selling price of homes closed, while the number of
    homes closed decreased 2%. Income before income taxes for the
    region was 15% higher in 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a
    percentage of the region’s revenues, it decreased
    20 basis points to 21.5%, from 21.7% in 2005. While core
    homebuilding margin was relatively flat in the Phoenix market
    for the full fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005,
    we did experience a sharp decline in the Phoenix market home
    sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as
    compared with the earlier quarters.

California Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    remained relatively flat, increasing only 1% in 2006 compared to
    2005, reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed
    and a slight decline in the average selling price of those
    homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 54% lower
    in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the
    region’s revenues, decreased 1,120 basis points to
    9.5%, from 20.7% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in
    the region’s gross profit percentage, which was
    significantly affected by a decline of approximately
    600 basis points in the region’s core home sales gross
    margins with the largest declines in the Sacramento and
    San Diego markets. In addition, the recording of inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs of $165.8 million in fiscal 2006 versus
    $9.2 million in fiscal 2005 had a significant negative
    impact on gross margins.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues remained
    relatively flat, increasing only 2% in 2006 compared to 2005,
    due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and
    in the average selling price of those homes. Income before
    income taxes for the region was 13% lower in 2006 compared to
    2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues,
    decreased 390 basis points to 22.9%, from 26.8% in 2005.
    This decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross
    profit percentage, primarily attributable to lower gross margins
    in the Las Vegas market.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage
    operations is directly related to the number and value of homes
    closed by our homebuilding operations. Total first-lien loans
    originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers
    decreased by 24% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006,
    corresponding to



the decrease in the number of homes closed of 22%. The
    percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the
    percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our
    mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by
    our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the
    homebuyers’ financing), to 66% in 2007, from 68% in 2006.
    Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95%
    of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2007, compared to 94% in
    2006. These rates reflect DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The number of loans sold to third-party investors
    decreased by 29% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was
    primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans
    originated.

During fiscal 2007, the market for certain non-traditional
    mortgage loans changed substantially, resulting in the reduced
    availability of some loan products that had previously been
    available to borrowers. The affected loan products were
    generally characterized by high combined loan-to-value ratios in
    combination with less required documentation than traditional
    mortgage loans. Such loans constituted approximately half of our
    total originations during fiscal 2006, but such products
    declined substantially as a percentage of total originations
    during fiscal 2007, primarily in the third and fourth quarters.
    As a percentage of total loans originated, originations of
    traditional conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured
    loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, to approximately 90%, corresponding to the
    reduction in non-traditional mortgage loans.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29%, to
    $207.7 million in 2007 from $290.8 million in 2006.
    The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of
    mortgage loans originated and sold. The majority of the revenues
    associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors. Additionally, we increased our loan loss
    reserves from $15.6 million at September 30, 2006, to
    $24.6 million at September 30, 2007 to cover estimated
    losses on loans held in portfolio, loans held for sale, and
    future obligations related to loans sold with recourse. The
    increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding decrease to
    the gains on sale of mortgages, and reflects the current market
    conditions related to non-traditional products as described
    above, as well as potential repurchase obligations that exist on
    certain loans previously sold.

General and administrative (G&A) expenses associated with
    financial services decreased 24%, to $153.8 million in 2007
    from $202.2 million in 2006. The largest component of our
    financial services G&A expense is employee compensation and
    related costs, which represented 75% and 77% of G&A costs
    in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased 26%, to
    $114.9 million in 2007 from $155.4 million in 2006, as
    we have aligned the number of employees with current and
    anticipated loan origination and title service levels. Our
    financial services operations employed approximately 1,100 and
    1,700 employees at September 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. As a percentage of financial services revenues,
    G&A expenses increased by 450 basis points, to 74.0%
    in 2007, from 69.5% in 2006. The increase was primarily due to
    the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage
    loan volume during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss
    expense discussed above. Fluctuations in financial services
    general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues
    can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue
    earned, as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage
    loan volume.

Interest and other income decreased 32%, to $38.5 million
    in 2007 from $56.9 million in 2006, primarily due to the
    decreased volume of loan originations.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

Total first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage
    for our homebuyers increased 11% in fiscal 2006 compared to
    fiscal 2005. The increase in loans originated or brokered was
    greater than our 4% increase in the number of homes closed
    because our mortgage capture rate increased to 68% in 2006 from
    63% in 2005. Home closings from our homebuilding operations
    constituted 94% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2006,
    compared to 93% in 2005, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s
    continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by
    our homebuilding operations.



The number of loans sold to third-party investors increased 41%
    in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to
    the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated, as well
    as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes
    during fiscal 2006. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2006
    includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of
    mortgage loans held at September 30, 2005.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment increased 24%, to
    $290.8 million in 2006 from $235.1 million in 2005.
    The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to
    the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and
    sold, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average
    mortgage revenues earned per loan sold. The decline in revenue
    per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions
    for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in
    fiscal 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the revenues
    associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors.

G&A expenses associated with financial services increased
    37%, to $202.2 million in 2006 from $147.6 million in
    2005. The largest component of our financial services G&A
    expense is employee compensation and related costs, which
    represented 77% and 76% of G&A costs in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Those costs increased 39%, to $155.4 million
    in 2006 from $111.6 million in 2005, largely due to the
    addition of employees to support our previously planned growth.
    As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A
    expenses increased by 670 basis points, to 69.5% in 2006
    from 62.8% in 2005, reflecting the growth of our financial
    services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in
    revenues during fiscal 2006.

Interest and other income increased 63%, to $56.9 million
    in 2006 from $34.9 million in 2005, primarily due to
    increases in loan origination volume and interest rates.

Overview
    of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial
    services operations with cash flows from operating activities,
    borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of
    new debt securities. As we utilize our capital resources and
    liquidity to fund our operations, we have focused on maintaining
    a strong balance sheet.

At September 30, 2007, our ratio of net homebuilding debt
    to total capital was 40.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points
    from 40.7% at September 30, 2006. Net homebuilding debt to
    total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash
    divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable
    net of cash plus stockholders’ equity). The decrease in our
    ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at
    September 30, 2007 as compared with the ratio a year
    earlier was primarily due to paying down our homebuilding debt
    with cash flows from operations, partially offset by the
    decrease in retained earnings and cash. Our target operating
    range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45%,
    so the 40.2% ratio at September 30, 2007 is in line with
    our operating target. We remain focused on maintaining our
    liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so we can be
    flexible in reacting to market conditions; however, future
    fiscal year-end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios
    may be higher than the fiscal 2007 year-end ratio.

We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our
    homebuilding operations and comparing us with other
    homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services
    business because it is separately capitalized and its debt is
    substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent
    company or any of our homebuilding entities. Because of its
    capital function, we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of
    our homebuilding debt and total capital. For comparison to our
    ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above, at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, our ratios of homebuilding
    debt to total capital, without netting cash balances, were 41.7%
    and 43.1%, respectively.

We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our
    homebuilding and financial services operations and our future
    cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of
    our existing cash resources,



cash flows from operations, our existing, renewed or amended
    credit facilities and, if needed, the issuance of new securities
    through the public capital markets.

Homebuilding
    Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2007, we had available homebuilding cash and
    cash equivalents of $228.3 million.

Bank Credit Facility

— During November 2006, we
    increased the size of our $2.15 billion unsecured revolving
    credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of
    credit sub-facility, to $2.5 billion and extended its
    maturity by one year to December 16, 2011. The revolving
    credit facility has an uncommitted $400 million accordion
    provision which could be used to increase the facility to
    $2.9 billion upon obtaining additional commitments from
    lenders. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries other than our financial services
    subsidiaries. We borrow funds through the revolving credit
    facility throughout the year to fund working capital
    requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated
    from our operations and from the issuance of public securities.
    We had $150.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our
    homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30,
    2007, and $800.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding at
    September 30, 2006.

Our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our
    operations and activities, including limits on investments, cash
    dividends, stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness, and
    requires maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum
    level of tangible net worth and a minimum ratio of earnings
    before income taxes, depreciation, amortization, asset valuation
    adjustments and non-cash gains and losses to interest incurred.
    At September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with all of
    the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of
    our bank revolving credit facility and our public debt
    obligations. Our continued borrowing availability depends on our
    ability to remain in compliance with these covenants,
    limitations and restrictions. Additionally, if it appears that
    we will not be able to comply with these requirements in the
    future, it could be more difficult and expensive to obtain
    additional financing.

The following table presents the levels required to maintain our
    compliance with the financial debt covenants associated with our
    revolving credit facility, and the levels achieved as of and for
    the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. These debt
    covenants are required to be maintained by us and all of our
    direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, Guarantor
    Subsidiaries), other than the financial services subsidiaries
    and certain inconsequential subsidiaries (collectively,
    Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries).

    and dividing by the sum of stockholders’ equity and net
    notes payable.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding the following items to
    pre-tax income:

•

Interest expensed and amortized to cost of sales

•

Depreciation and amortization

•

Inventory impairments, land option cost write-offs and goodwill
    impairments

(3)

Minimum Tangible Net Worth is calculated by deducting goodwill
    from stockholders’ equity.

In July 2007, through amendment to the revolving credit
    facility, a restriction was removed that limited our ability to
    pay cash dividends to an annual amount not to exceed 50% of
    prior year consolidated net income. Under the amended agreement,
    payment of dividends is permitted provided there is no payment



default under the facility, we are in compliance with certain
    financial covenants under the agreement, and such payments do
    not cause us to be in noncompliance with those financial
    covenants.

Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit
    facility, if we have fewer than two investment grade senior
    unsecured debt ratings from Moody’s Investors Service,
    Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, we
    would be subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions
    on unsold homes and residential land and lots.

The borrowing base covenant limits our additional homebuilding
    borrowing capacity to the amount determined under the
    arrangement, which was in excess of our borrowing capacity under
    the revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity under our
    homebuilding revolving credit facility was $2.3 billion at
    September 30, 2007 and would not have been affected had the
    restriction been in place. Additional restrictions limit the
    ratio of our unsold homes to the trailing twelve months’
    unit home closings to 40%, and limit the ratio of our
    residential land and lots to tangible net worth to 150%. At
    September 30, 2007, these ratios were approximately 26% and
    110%, respectively. Although our ratings were in the lowest
    investment grade category at each agency, and during fiscal 2007
    they were placed on negative outlook by all the three rating
    agencies, at September 30, 2007, we still held investment
    grade ratings from all three rating agencies, so the borrowing
    base limitation was not in effect.

In October 2007, Moody’s Investors Service placed our
    senior debt rating under review for downgrade, and in November
    2007, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded our
    senior debt rating by one level to BB+, which is below
    investment grade status.

Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt —

On
    April 15, 2007, we redeemed our 8.5% senior notes due
    2012 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately
    $260.6 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the
    redemption, we recorded a loss related to the early retirement
    of debt of approximately $12.1 million, representing the
    call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to
    the redeemed notes. We used proceeds from our revolving credit
    facility for the redemption.

Shelf Registration Statements —

We have an
    automatically effective universal shelf registration statement
    filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, registering
    debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time
    in amounts to be determined. Also, at September 30, 2007,
    we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million
    shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration
    statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future
    business acquisitions.

Financial
    Services Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2007, we had available financial services
    cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million.

Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility

— DHI Mortgage
    has a $540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that
    was renewed on March 30, 2007 to extend its maturity from
    April 6, 2007 to March 28, 2008. Under the accordion
    provision of the credit agreement, the total capacity may be
    increased to $750 million upon obtaining additional
    commitments from lenders. At September 30, 2007, we had
    borrowings of $267.8 million outstanding under the mortgage
    warehouse facility.

Our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the
    lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount
    determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the
    borrowing base limitation, the amount that may be drawn on our
    mortgage warehouse facility varies based upon the underlying
    product type of each eligible mortgage loan. Substantially all
    of our mortgage originations are eligible, with advance rates
    typically ranging from 95% to 98% of the unpaid principal
    balance of each mortgage loan.

Commercial Paper Conduit Facility

— DHI
    Mortgage also has a $600 million commercial paper conduit
    facility (the “CP conduit facility”) that matures
    June 27, 2009, subject to the annual renewal of the

364-day

backup liquidity feature. This credit facility, which previously
    had a capacity of $1.2 billion, was amended in December
    2006 to reduce the capacity to $800 million, and upon
    renewal of the backup liquidity feature in



June 2007, was further amended to reduce the capacity to
    $600 million. At September 30, 2007, we had borrowings
    of $120.0 million outstanding under the CP conduit facility.

In the past, we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage
    warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility on
    satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain
    temporary additional commitments through amendments of the
    respective credit agreements during periods of higher than
    normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our
    financial services business depends upon our continued ability
    to renew and extend these facilities or to obtain other
    additional financing in sufficient capacities. The recent credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets has increased the financing
    costs related to mortgage-secured borrowings and may affect our
    ability to renew and extend these borrowing facilities on
    similar terms.

The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility
    are not guaranteed by either D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of
    the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt.
    Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage
    loans held for sale, and by restricted cash to the extent
    borrowings under the facility occur prior to the assignment of
    mortgage loans held for sale as collateral. The mortgage loans
    assigned to secure the CP conduit facility are used as
    collateral for asset-backed commercial paper issued by
    multi-seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At
    September 30, 2007, our financial services subsidiaries
    held total mortgage loans for sale of $523.5 million. All
    mortgage company activities have been financed with the mortgage
    warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally
    generated funds. Both of the financial services credit
    facilities contain financial covenants as to our mortgage
    subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth, its
    maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its
    minimum required net income. In addition, the CP conduit
    facility contains certain advance cessation triggers based on
    specified performance metrics of the Company and its Guarantor
    Subsidiaries which govern the availability of credit under the
    facility. At September 30, 2007, our financial services
    subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the conditions and
    covenants of the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP
    conduit facility.

Operating
    Cash Flow Activities

During the year ended September 30, 2007, net cash provided
    by our operating activities was $1.4 billion, as compared
    to cash used in operating activities during the prior year of
    $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2007, we generated positive
    cash flows from operating activities as we produced operating
    profits, excluding the impact of asset impairments and
    write-offs. We also limited our investments in inventory during
    fiscal 2007, as evidenced by a $737.6 million decrease in
    owned inventory (excluding the impact of impairments and
    write-offs) during the fiscal year, compared to
    $3.1 billion of inventory growth in fiscal 2006. In light
    of the challenging market conditions, we have substantially
    slowed our purchases of land and lots and our development
    spending on land we own, and have restricted the number of homes
    under construction to better match our expected current rate of
    home sales and closings. We plan to continue to reduce our
    number of homes under construction during fiscal 2008 by
    starting construction on fewer homes than we close, and continue
    to significantly limit our development spending. Our ability to
    reduce our inventory levels is, however, heavily dependent upon
    our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the
    year, which may be negatively impacted if our sales order
    cancellation rate remains at elevated levels. To the extent our
    inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2008, we expect to
    generate net positive cash flows from operating activities in
    fiscal 2008, should all other factors remain constant.

Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in
    fiscal 2007 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of
    $499.4 million during the year. The decrease in mortgage
    loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans
    originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We expect to continue to use
    cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in
    quarters when our homebuilding closings grow. However, in
    periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to
    prior periods, or if our mortgage capture rate declines, the
    amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate
    positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage
    loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2007.



Investing
    Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2007 and 2006, cash used in investing activities
    represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily
    model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are
    not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, but
    were reduced in fiscal 2007 in light of the weaker market
    conditions.

Financing
    Cash Flow Activities

The majority of our short-term financing needs are funded with
    cash generated from operations and borrowings available under
    our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities.
    Long-term financing needs of our homebuilding operations are
    generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt
    securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding
    senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our
    homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by
    substantially all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries other than
    our financial services subsidiaries.

Borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the CP conduit
    facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held
    for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the
    facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as
    collateral. At September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings
    under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans
    held for sale, and therefore, no cash was restricted under this
    facility for this purpose. At September 30, 2006, the
    balance of cash restricted for this purpose was
    $248.3 million.

During fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors declared four
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share, the last of
    which was paid on August 27, 2007 to stockholders of record
    on August 17, 2007. On October 24, 2007, our Board of
    Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share,
    which was paid on November 16, 2007, to stockholders of
    record on November 5, 2007. The declaration of future cash
    dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and
    will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash
    flows, capital requirements, our financial condition and general
    business conditions.

Changes
    in Capital Structure

In November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $463.2 million of our common stock and
    the repurchase of debt securities of up to $500 million.
    These authorizations replaced the previous common stock and debt
    securities repurchase authorizations and were in effect through
    November 30, 2007. As of September 30, 2007, the full
    amount of both authorizations remained available for
    repurchases. In November 2007, our Board of Directors renewed
    and extended both authorizations to November 30, 2008.

In fiscal 2007, our primary non-operating uses of our available
    capital were the repayment of debt, and dividend payments, which
    we expect to remain as our top priorities in fiscal 2008. We
    continue to evaluate our alternatives for future non-operating
    uses of our available capital, including the amounts of planned
    debt repayments, dividend payments, maintenance of cash balances
    and possible common stock repurchases, based on market
    conditions and other circumstances, and within the constraints
    of our balance sheet leverage targets, our liquidity targets and
    the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures.

Contractual
    Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding
    and financial services segments are payments under short-term
    and long-term debt agreements and lease payments under operating
    leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment
    represent specific performance requirements under lot option
    purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land
    contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We
    expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary
    course of business through our operating cash flows, our
    homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by
    accessing the public capital markets.

    September 30, 2007 are presented below:

Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest
    payments due on our senior and senior subordinated notes, our
    revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The principal
    amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be
    $150 million through its maturity, and the related interest
    obligation is based on the effective rate of 6.0% as of
    September 30, 2007.

(2)

Financial services notes payable represent principal and
    interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary’s
    warehouse loan facility and commercial paper conduit facility.
    The interest obligations associated with these variable rate
    facilities are based on their effective rates of 5.9% on both
    facilities, and principal balances outstanding at
    September 30, 2007.

At September 30, 2007, our homebuilding operations had
    outstanding letters of credit of $97.7 million and surety
    bonds of $2.1 billion, issued by third parties, to secure
    performance under various contracts. We expect that our
    performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and
    bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of
    business and in accordance with the applicable contractual
    terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related
    letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly
    thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have
    no material third-party guarantees.

Our financial services subsidiary enters into various
    commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage
    operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided
    in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk” under Part II of this annual report
    on

Form 10-K.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot
    option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the
    construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control
    significant lot positions with limited capital investment and
    substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership
    and development. Within the land and lot option purchase
    contracts in force at September 30, 2007, there were a
    limited number of contracts, representing only
    $60.8 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase
    the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting certain
    obligations. Also, pursuant to the provisions of Interpretation
    No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — an interpretation of ARB No. 51”
    as amended (FIN 46), issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB), we consolidated certain variable
    interest entities with assets of $65.8 million related to
    some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts.
    Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no
    recourse against us. Additionally, pursuant to
    SFAS No. 49, “Accounting for Product Financing
    Arrangements,” we recorded $56.1 million of land
    inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and
    lot option purchase contracts. Further discussion of our land
    option contracts is provided in the “Land and Lot Position
    and Homes in Inventory” section that follows.

At September 30, 2007, we owned or controlled approximately
    230,000 lots, 27% of which were lots under option or similar
    contracts, compared with approximately 323,000 lots at
    September 30, 2006. Our current strategy is to continue to
    reduce our owned and controlled lot position in line with our
    reduced expectations for future home sales and closings, through
    the construction and sale of homes, opportunistic sales of land
    and lots, along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots
    currently controlled under option.

At September 30, 2007, we controlled approximately 63,000
    lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately
    $1.8 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts,
    with a total of $109.3 million in earnest money deposits.
    Our lots controlled included approximately 18,200 optioned lots
    with a remaining purchase price of approximately
    $548.5 million and secured by deposits totaling
    $34.4 million, for which we do not expect to exercise our
    option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not
    yet been terminated. Consequently, we have written off the
    deposits related to these contracts, resulting in a net earnest
    money deposit balance of $74.9 million at
    September 30, 2007.

We had a total of approximately 19,900 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 2,000 model homes at September 30,
    2007, compared to approximately 28,500 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,900 model homes at September 30,
    2006. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 10,600 and
    14,200 were unsold at September 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. At September 30, 2007, approximately 5,000 of
    our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 1,100
    had been completed for more than six months. At
    September 30, 2006, approximately 5,000 of our unsold homes
    were completed, of which approximately 440 homes had been
    completed for more than six months. Our strategy is to continue
    to reduce our total number of homes in inventory and our number
    of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2008, in line with
    our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Before the
    current housing downturn, we generally had more homes under
    construction, closed more homes and had greater revenues and
    operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal
    year. This seasonal activity increased our working capital
    requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third
    and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding
    requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial
    services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of
    seasonal activity, our results of



operations and financial position at the end of a particular
    fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance
    of our fiscal year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further
    deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during fiscal
    2007, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and
    fourth fiscal quarters. These results were primarily due to
    recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges.
    Also, the increasingly challenging market conditions caused
    further weakening in sales volume, pricing and margins as the
    fiscal year progressed. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

Inflation

We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely
    affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of
    higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs.
    In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly
    affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to
    prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our
    customers any increases in our costs through increased sales
    prices. However, during periods of soft housing market
    conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases,
    particularly higher land costs, with higher selling prices.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in
    other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press
    releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders
    and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be
    construed as “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements are based on management’s
    beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information
    currently available to, management. These forward-looking
    statements typically include the words “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “consider,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,”
    “intend,” “objective,” “plan,”
    “predict,” “projection,” “seek,”
    “strategy,” “target” or other words of
    similar meaning. Any or all of the forward-looking statements
    included in this report and in any other of our reports or
    public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the
    expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to
    risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result, actual
    results may differ materially from the expectations or results
    we discuss in the forward-looking statements. These risks,
    uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to:

•

further deterioration in industry conditions;

•

the reduction of liquidity in the financial markets;

•

limitations on our strategies in responding to adverse
    conditions in the industry;

Critical
    Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the
    significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying
    financial statements as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and
    for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Each
    of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current
    authoritative literature that collectively comprises
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In
    instances where alternative methods of accounting are
    permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most
    appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results
    of our operations and our financial condition, and have
    consistently applied those methods over each of the periods
    presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting
    policies selected.

Basis of Presentation

— Our financial
    statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of
    its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. We
    have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from
    which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts,
    under the requirements of FIN 46. All significant
    intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize
    homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the
    closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property
    are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the
    buyer’s financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our
    wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an
    adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by
    SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred
    until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party
    investor has been completed. We include amounts in transit from
    title companies at the end of each reporting period in
    homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our
    homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers
    for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes,
    we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the
    homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain
    or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts,
    depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or
    other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our
    title operations as closing services are rendered and title
    insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur
    simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially
    all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies
    to third-party insurers. We recognize the majority of the
    revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors. Origination fees and direct origination
    costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses,
    respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the
    sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans
    are sold. We generally do not retain or service the mortgages
    that we originate but, rather, sell the mortgages and related
    servicing rights to third-party investors. Interest income is
    accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the
    loan is sold.

Mortgage loans held for sale are generally carried at cost
    adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation
    of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale
    commitments or current market quotes. Some of the loans sold by
    DHI Mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions and may
    be required to be repurchased under certain conditions including
    if certain specified payment(s), generally initial payment(s),
    are not made by the borrowers. We record loss allowances for
    loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale, and



reserves for losses related to loans sold with recourse,
    utilizing estimates based on historical experience and current
    market conditions. Unhedged loans are stated at the lower of
    cost or market. Market is determined by either sales commitments
    or current market conditions.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory
    includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development
    and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes
    and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home
    construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur
    after development projects or homes are substantially complete,
    such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such
    as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel
    and division and region management, advertising and
    builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense
    as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. We use the specific
    identification method for the purpose of accumulating home
    construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the
    specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the
    estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home
    closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro-rata
    basis to the remaining homes in the project.

When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and
    recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each
    month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales
    the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to
    completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that
    month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual
    recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be
    paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each
    month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on
    closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously
    accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on
    previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals,
    historically, differences in amounts have not been significant.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and
    related communities under development are reviewed for potential
    write-downs when impairment indicators are present.
    SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is
    less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows
    are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and
    timing of revenues and costs and other factors which, in turn,
    are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions
    of competitors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination
    of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated
    cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks
    associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow
    streams.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges
    are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed
    projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these
    homes.

Land Inventory Not Owned

— We account for our
    land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the
    provisions of FIN 46. FIN 46 provides guidance for the
    financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain
    variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain
    business entities that either have equity investors with no
    voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide
    sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their
    activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities
    by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss
    from the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a
    majority of the entities’ residual returns or both, defined
    as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity.

In the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter
    into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase
    contracts, we will fund a



stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the
    obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time
    with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase
    contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our
    discretion. Under the requirements of FIN 46, certain of
    the option purchase contracts result in the creation of a
    variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under
    option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those
    land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest
    entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary
    based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and
    losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the
    primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into
    a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest
    entity is consolidated.

Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated
    variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to
    FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence
    over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our
    requests for financial information are denied by the land
    sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of
    such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the
    assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the
    remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are
    purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have
    no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or
    lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority
    interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable
    interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest
    entities have no recourse against us.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess of
    purchase price over net assets acquired. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” we test goodwill for potential impairment annually
    as of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or
    circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of
    goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential
    impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a
    two-step process that begins with the estimation of the fair
    value of the reporting units. If the results of the first step
    indicate that impairment potentially exists, the second step is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any.
    Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value
    of goodwill is less than its carrying value.

Warranty Costs

— We have established warranty
    reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty
    liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged
    to be adequate to cover expected warranty-related costs for
    materials and labor required under one- and ten-year warranty
    obligation periods. The one-year warranty is comprehensive for
    all parts and labor; the ten-year period is for major
    construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon
    our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which
    we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect
    qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and
    the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future
    warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
    amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to
    estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material
    change in our accrual.

Insurance Claim Costs

— We have, and require
    the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general
    liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and
    workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect
    us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to
    certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage
    limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or
    expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general
    liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from
    subcontractors. We self-insure a portion of our overall risk,
    partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which
    issues a general liability policy to us, naming some
    subcontractors as additional insureds.

We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover
    our self-insured and deductible amounts under our insurance
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our
    coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an
    analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
    Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to
    a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends
    in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the
    types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance
    industry practices and legal interpretations, among others.
    Because of the high



degree of judgment required in determining these estimated
    liability amounts, actual future costs could differ
    significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change
    in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to
    estimate the self-insured accruals would result in a change of
    approximately $50.0 million in our accrual.

Income Taxes

— We calculate a provision for
    income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by
    identifying the temporary differences arising from the different
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing
    the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it
    is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
    deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation
    of future taxable income during the periods in which those
    temporary differences become deductible. In determining the
    future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
    our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required.
    Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these
    future tax consequences could have a material impact on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Stock-based Compensation

— With the approval of
    our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of
    our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees
    and directors options to purchase our common stock. The
    committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining
    available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our
    common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with
    exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on
    the date of the option grant. The majority of the options
    granted vest ratably over a ten-year period.

On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate
    the fair value of stock options using the Black- Scholes option
    pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based awards
    at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions,
    which involve a number of variables. These variables include,
    but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over
    the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected
    stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use
    judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are
    expected to be forfeited.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109, “Written Loan
    Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings.”
    SAB No. 109, which revises and rescinds portions of
    SAB No. 105, “Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments,” specifically states that
    the expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all
    written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value
    through earnings. The provisions of SAB No. 109 are
    applicable to written loan commitments issued or modified
    beginning on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating
    the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 109.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” The statement permits entities to choose to
    measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159; however, it is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue (EITF)

No. 06-8,

“Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s
    Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales
    of Condominiums.”

EITF 06-8

establishes that an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the
    buyer’s continuing investment in determining whether to
    recognize profit under the percentage-of-completion method.

EITF 06-8

is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning
    after March 15, 2007. The adoption of

EITF 06-8

will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.



In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157; however, it is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement 109.”
    FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing,
    measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return,
    including a decision whether to file or not to file in a
    particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact of the
    adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We
    monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize
    both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes
    in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt
    instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for
    variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not
    impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our
    future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure
    to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by
    entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed
    interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We
    generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt
    prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and
    changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our
    cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we
    are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.

Our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” We are exposed to
    market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the
    swaps, and such changes are reflected in our statements of
    operations.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our
    mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk
    through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
    (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on
    mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the term
    “hedging instruments” in the following discussion
    refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination.
    We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or
    speculative purposes.

Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers
    who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit
    and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration
    of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to
    a specific investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to
    being committed to third-party investors. The hedging
    instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as
    non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses
    recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments related to
    funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges,
    with changes in the value of the derivative instruments
    recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value
    of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair
    value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness,
    which for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005
    was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At
    September 30, 2007, hedging instruments to mitigate
    interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held
    for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $630.4 million.
    Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than
    six months, totaled approximately $154.4 million, and
    uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately
    $129.2 million at September 30, 2007. The fair value
    of the hedging instruments and IRLCs at September 30, 2007
    was an insignificant amount.

We also purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic
    interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer
    homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing.
    At September 30, 2007, these potential mortgage loan
    originations totaled approximately $124.9 million and were
    hedged with FRAs



of $72.1 million and economic interest rate hedges of
    $526.9 million in EDFC put options and $29.6 million
    in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate
    hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months.
    These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and
    are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized
    in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended
    September 30, 2007 were not significant.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected
    maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair
    value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2007. The
    interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted
    average interest rates in effect at September 30, 2007. In
    addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted
    average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest
    rate swaps. Because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and
    CP conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held
    for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, the
    outstanding balances at September 30, 2007 are included in
    the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending
    September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2007, the fair
    value of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million
    liability.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2007. These financial statements are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of D.R. Horton, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    November 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A —

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D. R. Horton, Inc.
    and all of its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled
    subsidiaries (which are referred to as the Company, unless the
    context otherwise requires), as well as certain variable
    interest entities required to be consolidated pursuant to
    Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — an interpretation of ARB
    No. 51,” as amended (FIN 46), issued by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). All significant
    intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

The prior year balance of the deferred tax asset has been
    reclassified from earnest money deposits and other assets to
    deferred income taxes on the September 30, 2006
    consolidated balance sheet to conform to the fiscal 2007
    presentation. Additionally, the corresponding changes to the
    consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended
    September 30, 2006 and 2005 have been made.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized
    at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and
    possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In
    situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI
    Mortgage, the Company’s wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary,
    and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
    investment as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real
    Estate,” the profit on such sales is deferred until the
    sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has
    been completed. At September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    had deferred profit on such sales in the amounts of
    $32.6 million and $90.6 million, respectively.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s
    title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered
    and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally
    occur simultaneously as each home is closed. The Company
    transfers substantially all underwriting risk associated with
    title insurance policies to third-party insurers. The majority
    of the revenues associated with the Company’s mortgage
    operations is recognized when the mortgage loans and related
    servicing rights are sold to third-party investors. Origination
    fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as
    revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated
    gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing
    rights, when the loans are sold. The Company generally does not
    retain or service the mortgages that it originates but, rather,
    sells the mortgages and related servicing rights to third-party
    investors. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage
    loan is originated until the loan is sold.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
    initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. Amounts in transit from title companies for
    home closings at the end of each reporting period are included
    in homebuilding cash.



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted
    Cash

The Company holds cash that is restricted as to its use.
    Restricted cash related to the Company’s homebuilding
    operations includes customer deposits that are temporarily
    restricted in accordance with regulatory requirements. At
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, the balances of restricted
    cash were $5.4 million and $38.8 million,
    respectively, and are included in other assets on the
    Company’s balance sheet.

Borrowings by the Company’s mortgage subsidiary under the
    CP conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage
    loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings
    under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans
    as collateral. At September 30, 2007, there were no
    borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of
    mortgage loans held for sale, and therefore, no cash was
    restricted under this facility for this purpose. At
    September 30, 2006, the balance of cash restricted for this
    purpose was $248.3 million.

Inventories
    and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land
    development and home construction, capitalized interest, real
    estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during
    development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead
    costs incurred after development projects or homes are
    substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance and
    cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative
    (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs,
    such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales
    personnel and division and region management, advertising and
    builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense
    as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. The specific identification
    method is used for the purpose of accumulating home construction
    costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific
    construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the
    estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home
    closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro-rata
    basis to the remaining homes in the project.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not yet paid
    and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home.
    Each month a liability and a charge to cost of sales is recorded
    for the amount that is determined will ultimately be paid
    related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end
    of that month. The home construction budgets are compared to
    actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs
    remaining to be paid on each closed home. The accuracy of each
    month’s accrual is monitored by comparing actual costs
    incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount
    previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the
    future on previously closed homes could differ from the
    Company’s current accruals, historically, differences in
    amounts have not been significant.

Each quarter, all components of inventory are reviewed for the
    purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required
    to complete each home or project are recoverable. If the review
    indicates that an impairment loss is required under the
    guidelines of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” an estimate
    of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in that
    quarter. See Note B.

Homebuilding
    Interest

The Company capitalizes homebuilding interest costs to inventory
    during development and construction. Capitalized interest is
    charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered
    to the buyer. Additionally,

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

the Company writes off a portion of the capitalized interest
    related to projects for which inventory impairments are recorded
    in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

The following table summarizes the Company’s homebuilding
    interest costs incurred (which does not include losses on early
    retirement of debt), capitalized, charged to cost of sales and

Land
    Inventory Not Owned

The Company accounts for its land and lot option purchase
    contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46.
    FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and
    reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities,
    which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that
    either have equity investors with no voting rights or have
    equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
    resources for the entities to support their activities.
    FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any
    company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
    the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a
    majority of the entities’ residual returns or both, defined
    as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. See
    Note C.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
    asset. Depreciable lives for model home furniture typically
    range from 2 to 3 years, depreciable lives for office
    furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years,
    and depreciable lives for buildings and improvements typically
    range from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
    $157.9 million and $130.0 million as of
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Depreciation
    expense was $64.3 million, $56.5 million and
    $52.8 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets
    acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the Company
    tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September
    30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change
    that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be
    recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill,
    SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two-step process that begins
    with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. If
    the results of the first step indicate that impairment
    potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the
    amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to
    exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its
    carrying value. See Note D.

Warranty
    Costs

The Company typically provides its homebuyers a one-year
    comprehensive limited warranty for all parts and labor and a
    ten-year limited warranty for major construction defects. Since
    the Company subcontracts its

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

homebuilding work to subcontractors who typically provide it
    with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to
    receiving payments for their work, claims relating to
    workmanship and materials are generally the primary
    responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have
    been established by charging cost of sales for each home
    delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s
    estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired
    warranty obligation periods. The Company’s warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which it operates and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    built and the geographic areas in which they are built.

Insurance
    Claim Costs

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors
    to have, general liability insurance (including construction
    defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These
    insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its
    risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
    retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In certain
    states where the Company believes it is too difficult or
    expensive for subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, the Company has waived its traditional subcontractor
    general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids
    from subcontractors. The Company self-insures a portion of its
    overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance
    entity which issues a general liability policy to the Company,
    naming certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The
    Company records expenses and liabilities related to the costs to
    cover its self-insured and deductible amounts under those
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of its
    coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an
    analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which includes
    an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Expenses
    related to such claims were approximately $95.0 million,
    $41.7 million and $101.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $90.6 million,
    $110.6 million and $78.9 million in fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes is calculated
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference
    between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the
    realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
    which those temporary differences become deductible. In
    determining the future tax consequences of events that have been
    recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax
    returns,



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and
    actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations or financial position. See Note G.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings, or loss, per share is based upon the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
    year. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities
    outstanding during each year. In periods with a loss, the
    computation of loss per share excludes outstanding stock options
    because their effect would be antidilutive. See Note H.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

With the approval of the compensation committee, consisting of
    independent members of the Board of Directors, the Company from
    time to time issues to employees and directors options to
    purchase its common stock. The committee approves grants only
    out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts
    formally authorized by the common stockholders.

On October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements.
    SFAS No. 123(R) was adopted using the modified
    prospective method. Under this method, the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) apply to all awards granted or
    modified after the date of adoption. In addition, compensation
    expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards
    outstanding as of the date of adoption on a straight-line basis
    over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of the
    options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Results for fiscal 2005 have not been restated. In
    addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires the benefits of tax
    deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be
    reported in the Statement of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow
    rather than an operating cash flow as previously reported. See
    Note J.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale, Loan Commitments and Related
    Derivatives

Mortgage loans held for sale are generally carried at cost
    adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation
    of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale
    commitments or current market quotes. Any gain or loss on the
    sale of loans is recognized at the time of sale. Some of the
    loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited recourse
    provisions. Based on historical experience, the Company
    estimates and records an allowance or reserve for loans held in
    portfolio or loans held for sale or for losses related to loans
    sold with recourse. The derivative instruments associated with
    uncommitted, funded loans are designated as fair value hedges of
    the risk of changes in the overall fair value of the related
    loans. Accordingly, changes in the value of the derivative
    instruments are recognized in current earnings, as are changes
    in the value of the loans. Unhedged loans are stated at the
    lower of cost or market. Market is determined by either sales
    commitments or current market conditions.

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is
    party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are
    extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet
    certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and related
    Derivatives Implementation Group conclusions, the Company
    classifies and accounts for IRLCs as non-designated derivative
    instruments at fair value. The interest rate risk related to
    IRLCs is managed through the use of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments and various hedging instruments, which are
    considered non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at
    fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company purchases forward rate agreements (FRAs) and
    economic interest rate hedges as part of a program designed to
    potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on
    their home financing. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. See
    Note F.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109, “Written Loan
    Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings.”
    SAB No. 109, which revises and rescinds portions of
    SAB No. 105, “Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments,” specifically states that
    the expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all
    written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value
    through earnings. The provisions of SAB No. 109 are
    applicable to written loan commitments issued or modified
    beginning on January 1, 2008. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 109.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” The statement permits entities to choose to
    measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159; however, it is not expected
    to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue (EITF)

No. 06-8,

“Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyer’s
    Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales
    of Condominiums.”

EITF 06-8

establishes that an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the
    buyer’s continuing investment in determining whether to
    recognize profit under the percentage-of-completion method.

EITF 06-8

is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning
    after March 15, 2007. The adoption of

EITF 06-8

will not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of SFAS No. 157; however, it is not expected
    to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement 109.”
    FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing,
    measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements
    tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return,
    including a decision whether to file or not to file in a
    particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. The adoption of
    FIN 48 will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

NOTE B —
    INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS AND LAND OPTION COST WRITE-OFFS

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” land
    inventory and related communities under development are reviewed
    for potential write-downs when impairment indicators are
    present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less
    than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are
    significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of
    revenues and costs and other factors which, in turn, are
    impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of
    competitors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company’s
    determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting
    the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the
    inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
    cash flow streams.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges
    are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed
    projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these
    homes.

During fiscal 2007, the difficult conditions within the
    homebuilding industry became more challenging. Continued high
    inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated
    cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability
    issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout
    the year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by
    a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher
    mortgage interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with
    the Company’s disappointing sales results, declines in
    sales order prices and continued declines in gross profit from
    home sales revenues throughout the year, caused the
    Company’s outlook for the homebuilding industry and its
    impact on the Company’s business to become more cautious as
    the year progressed. The Company’s current outlook is that
    housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and
    may deteriorate further, and that the timing of a recovery in
    the housing market remains unclear.

During fiscal 2007, when the Company performed its quarterly
    inventory impairment analyses in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, the assumptions utilized reflect the
    expectation that the challenging conditions in the homebuilding
    industry will persist and have a greater impact than the Company
    believed when the year began. Consequently, the Company’s
    strategy to reduce its inventory and lot position in a number of
    markets will likely take longer and require additional price
    concessions and incentives than previously anticipated.
    Therefore, the impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant number of projects with
    impairment indicators. Communities with a combined carrying
    value of $2,622.4 million as of September 30, 2007,
    had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for
    impairment. The analysis of each of these projects generally
    assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or
    lower than current sales order prices in each project or for
    comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable
    absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe
    for a given project in the current market conditions, the
    remaining lives of these projects was estimated to be in a range
    from six months to in excess of ten years. Through these
    evaluations, it was determined that projects with a carrying
    value of $940.5 million as of September 30, 2007, the
    largest portions of which were in the California, West and
    Southeast regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007, impairment charges totaling
    $278.3 million were recorded to reduce the carrying value
    of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. These
    fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded
    earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment
    charges of $1,222.2 million during fiscal 2007.
    Approximately 74% of these impairment charges were recorded to
    residential land and lots and land held for development, and
    approximately 26% of these charges were recorded to residential
    construction in progress and finished homes in inventory. During
    fiscal 2006, impairment charges totaling $146.2 million
    were recorded related to projects with a carrying value of
    $459.3 million, the majority of which were in California.

If conditions in the homebuilding industry or specific markets
    in which the Company operates worsen in the future beyond
    current expectations, and as the Company re-evaluates specific
    project pricing and incentive strategies, the Company may be
    required to evaluate additional projects or re-evaluate
    previously impaired

projects for potential impairment. These evaluations may result
    in additional impairment charges, and such charges could be
    material.

Based on a review of land and lot option contracts performed
    each quarter, the Company writes off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to contracts which it no longer
    plans to pursue. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    wrote off $107.3 million, $124.7 million and
    $17.1 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts.

NOTE C —
    LAND INVENTORY NOT OWNED

In the ordinary course of its homebuilding business, the Company
    enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option
    purchase contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in
    consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
    land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms.
    Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of the
    option deposits are not refundable at the Company’s
    discretion. Under the requirements of FIN 46, certain of
    the Company’s option purchase contracts result in the
    creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land
    parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluates
    those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable
    interest entities to determine whether the Company is the
    primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of
    the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this
    evaluation, if the Company is the primary beneficiary of an
    entity with which the Company has entered into a land or lot
    option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is
    consolidated.

Since the Company owns no equity interest in any of the
    unaffiliated variable interest entities that it must consolidate
    pursuant to FIN 46, the Company generally has little or no
    control or influence over the operations of these entities or
    their owners. When the Company’s requests for financial
    information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions
    about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required.
    In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated
    entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual
    purchase price of the land or lots the Company is purchasing. In
    these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt
    obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots the
    Company has the option to buy with a related offset to minority
    interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable
    interest entity.

The consolidation of these variable interest entities added
    $65.8 million and $100.4 million in land inventory not
    owned and minority interests related to entities not owned to
    the Company’s balance sheets at September 30, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The Company’s obligations related to
    these land or lot option contracts are guaranteed by cash
    deposits totaling $11.3 million and $17.6 million and
    performance letters of credit, promissory notes and surety bonds
    totaling $0.5 million and $2.5 million, as of
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Creditors, if
    any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse
    against the Company.

For the variable interest entities which are unconsolidated
    because the Company is not subject to a majority of the risk of
    loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entities’
    residual returns, the maximum exposure to loss is generally
    limited to the amounts of the Company’s option deposits,
    which totaled $67.9 million at September 30, 2007.

Additionally, the Company evaluates land and lot option purchase
    contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 49,
    “Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements,” and
    added $56.1 million in land inventory not owned, with a
    corresponding increase to accrued expenses and other
    liabilities, to the Company’s balance sheet at
    September 30, 2007 as a result of this evaluation.

GOODWILL

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill balances
    between reporting segments have been restated to reflect the
    revised aggregation of operating regions that resulted from a
    realignment of the Company’s management structure during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The Colorado markets, which
    were previously included in the Southwest operating region, are
    now included in the Midwest operating region. Consequently, the
    Company determined that its Midwest operating region, which was
    previously included in the Northeast reporting segment,
    constitutes a separate reporting segment. The following
    discussion of goodwill balances and related impairment charges
    is based on this revised alignment and disaggregation.

At June 30, 2007, the Company determined that an interim
    test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary
    because of the significant amount of inventory tested for
    impairment under SFAS No. 144, the market conditions
    in the homebuilding industry and the decline in the
    Company’s stock price. The first step of the goodwill
    impairment analysis was completed as of June 30, 2007. The
    Company estimated the fair value of its operating regions
    primarily utilizing the expected present values of future cash
    flows, supported with a market based assessment of fair value
    for the reporting units, and concluded an impairment loss was
    probable and could be reasonably estimated for reporting units
    within its Northeast, Southeast, California and West reporting
    segments. As a result, during the quarter ended June 30,
    2007, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling
    $425.6 million related to the write-off of goodwill in
    these reporting segments.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, the Company
    completed the second step of its goodwill impairment analyses,
    through which it confirmed the appropriateness of the prior
    quarter write-offs and determined that the goodwill balance
    related to its Midwest reporting segment was completely
    impaired. Consequently, the goodwill balance in the Midwest
    reporting segment of $48.5 million, which included
    $13.5 million transferred from the Southwest reporting
    segment due to changing the Company’s management structure,
    was written off in the fourth quarter. Total goodwill impairment
    charges for fiscal 2007 were $474.1 million. Only
    approximately 23% of these goodwill impairment charges are
    deductible for tax purposes.

In addition, at September 30, 2007, the Company completed
    its annual impairment test and determined that the fair values
    of the South Central and Southwest reporting segments were
    greater than their carrying values and no impairment of goodwill
    existed in those segments.

Reflecting the fiscal 2007 impairment charges and restatement of
    the prior year segment balances to conform to the current year
    presentation, the Company’s goodwill balances by reporting
    segment as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Homebuilding:

In November 2006, the Company increased the size of its
    $2.15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which
    includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit sub-facility, to
    $2.5 billion and extended its maturity by one year to
    December 16, 2011. The revolving credit facility has an
    uncommitted $400 million accordion provision which could be
    used to increase the facility to $2.9 billion upon
    obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The
    Company’s borrowing capacity under this facility is reduced
    by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At
    September 30, 2007, the Company’s borrowing capacity
    under the facility was $2.3 billion. The facility is
    guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s
    wholly-owned subsidiaries other than its financial services
    subsidiaries. Borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the
    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon
    the Company’s ratio of homebuilding debt to total
    capitalization and its senior unsecured debt rating. The
    interest rates of the unsecured revolving credit facility at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 were 6.0% and 6.1%,
    respectively. In addition to the stated interest rates, the
    revolving credit facility requires the Company to pay certain
    fees.

Following is a summary of the key terms of each of the
    Company’s unsecured homebuilding notes payable outstanding
    as of September 30, 2007, including the annual effective
    interest rate of each series of notes, after giving effect to

notes issued prior to October 2004 have the right to require the
    Company to redeem such notes at a price of 101% of the par
    amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest.

On April 15, 2007, the Company redeemed its
    8.5% senior notes due 2012 at an aggregate redemption price
    of approximately $260.6 million, plus accrued interest.
    Concurrent with the redemption, the Company recorded a loss
    related to the early retirement of debt of approximately
    $12.1 million, representing the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes.

In November 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s
    outstanding debt securities, replacing the previous debt
    securities repurchase authorization of $200 million, and
    extending its term to November 30, 2007. All of the
    $500 million authorization was remaining at
    September 30, 2007. In November 2007, the Board of
    Directors extended the $500 million debt securities
    repurchase authorization to November 30, 2008.

The revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the
    senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the
    Company’s operations and activities. The most significant
    restrictions relate to limits on investments, cash dividends,
    stock repurchases and other restricted payments, incurrence of
    indebtedness, creation of liens and asset dispositions, and
    require maintenance of certain levels of leverage, interest
    coverage and tangible net worth. In addition, the indentures
    governing the senior notes impose restrictions on the creation
    of liens. At September 30, 2007, the Company was in
    compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and
    restrictions that form a part of the bank revolving credit
    facility and the public debt obligations.

The indentures governing approximately $1.75 billion of the
    senior notes provided for the termination of specified covenants
    upon the Company’s attainment of investment grade ratings
    from both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Moody’s Investors Service Inc. These covenants included
    restrictions on cash dividends, stock repurchases and other
    restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness and asset
    dispositions. The Company achieved both of the required ratings
    as of April 2006. As a result, the foregoing restrictions ceased
    to apply with respect to these senior notes and would not apply
    in the future with respect to these notes even if the
    Company’s ratings were subsequently lowered. In November
    2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    downgraded the Company’s senior debt rating by one level to
    BB+, which is below investment grade status.

In July 2007, through amendment to the revolving credit facility
    agreement, a restriction was removed that limited the
    Company’s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock
    to an annual amount not to exceed 50% of prior year consolidated
    net income. Under the amended agreement, payment of dividends is
    permitted provided there is no payment default under the
    facility, the Company is in compliance with certain financial
    covenants under the agreement, and such payments do not cause
    the Company not to be in compliance with those financial
    covenants. However, payment of cash dividends is still limited
    to the extent the Company’s total restricted payments are
    limited. At September 30, 2007, under the most restrictive
    debt covenants in effect, approximately $2.3 billion was
    available for all restricted payments.

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to help manage a
    portion of its interest rate exposure. The agreements convert a
    notional amount of $200 million from a variable rate to a
    fixed rate. These agreements are cancelable by the
    counter-party, a major U.S. bank, during periods where
    LIBOR exceeds 7%. The agreements expire at dates in fiscal 2008.
    The Company does not expect non-performance by the
    counter-party, and any losses incurred in the event of
    non-performance are not expected to be material. Net payments or
    receipts under these agreements are recorded as adjustments to
    interest incurred. As a result of these agreements, the
    Company’s net interest costs were reduced by
    $0.6 million in fiscal 2007, and were increased by
    $0.8 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The swaps’ market values generally vary directly with
    changes in anticipated future LIBOR rates. The swaps do not
    qualify as cash-flow hedges under SFAS No. 133 so
    changes in the swaps’ fair value must be recognized in
    current earnings, and are included in homebuilding other income
    or expense. At September 30, 2007 and 2006, the fair value
    of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million liability,
    and was recorded in

homebuilding other liabilities. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005, the Company had a loss of $0.1 million, and gains of
    $3.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively, related
    to the interest rate swaps.

Financial
    Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary has a $540 million
    mortgage warehouse loan facility, which was renewed on
    March 30, 2007 to extend its maturity from April 6,
    2007 to March 28, 2008. Under the accordion provision of
    the credit agreement, the total capacity may be increased to
    $750 million upon obtaining additional commitments from
    lenders.

The mortgage warehouse facility is secured by certain mortgage
    loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.
    or any of the guarantors of its homebuilding debt. The borrowing
    capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the
    unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a
    borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation,
    the amount that may be drawn on the facility varies based upon
    the underlying product type of each eligible mortgage loan.
    Substantially all of the Company’s mortgage originations
    are eligible, with advance rates typically ranging from 95% to
    98% of the unpaid principal balance of each mortgage loan.
    Borrowings bear daily interest at the

30-day

LIBOR
    rate plus a fixed premium. The interest rates of the mortgage
    warehouse line at September 30, 2007 and 2006 were 5.9% and
    6.1%, respectively.

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary also has a
    $600 million commercial paper conduit facility (the CP
    conduit facility), that matures June 27, 2009, subject to
    the annual renewal of the

364-day

backup liquidity feature. This credit facility, which previously
    had a capacity of $1.2 billion, was amended in December
    2006 to reduce the capacity to $800 million, and upon
    renewal of the backup liquidity feature in June 2007, was
    further amended to reduce the capacity to $600 million.

The CP conduit facility is secured by certain mortgage loans
    held for sale and is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any
    of the guarantors of its homebuilding debt. Additionally, at
    September 30, 2006, borrowings under the CP conduit
    facility were secured by restricted cash of $248.3 million
    arising from borrowings under the facility made prior to the
    assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral. At
    September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings under the
    facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for
    sale, and therefore, no cash was restricted under this facility.
    The mortgage loans assigned to secure the CP conduit facility
    are used as collateral for asset-backed commercial paper issued
    by multi-seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At
    September 30, 2007, the Company’s mortgage subsidiary
    was in compliance with all of the covenants under these
    facilities. The interest rates of the CP conduit facility at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 were 5.9% and 5.6%,
    respectively.

NOTE F —
    MORTGAGE LOANS

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage
    operations, the Company hedges its risk using various derivative
    instruments, which include forward sales of mortgage-backed
    securities (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put
    options on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the
    term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion
    refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination.
    The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading
    or speculative purposes.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family
    residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.
    Loans that have been closed but not committed to a third-party
    investor are matched with hedging instruments that are
    designated as fair value hedges. Hedged loans are either
    committed to third-party investors within three days of
    origination or pooled and committed in bulk to third-party
    investors typically within 30 days of origination. Loans
    held for sale are carried at cost adjusted for changes in fair
    value after

the date of designation of an effective accounting hedge, based
    on either sale commitments or current market quotes. Any gain or
    loss on the sale of loans is recognized at the time of sale.
    During the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    the Company had net gains on sales of loans of
    $97.8 million, $145.5 million, and
    $113.5 million, respectively.

Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited
    recourse provisions. Based on historical experience, the Company
    has estimated and recorded a total loss reserve for mortgage
    loans held in portfolio, mortgage loans held for sale, and
    expected losses related to loans sold with recourse of
    $24.6 million and $15.6 million at September 30,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge
    mortgage loans held for sale can vary in relationship to the
    underlying loan amounts, depending on the typical movements in
    the value of each hedging instrument relative to the value of
    the underlying mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2007,
    the Company had $129.2 million in loans not committed to
    third-party investors and hedging instruments related to those
    loans totaling $304.0 million.

The hedging instruments associated with uncommitted, funded
    loans are designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes
    in the overall fair value of the related loans. Accordingly,
    changes in the value of the derivative instruments are
    recognized in current earnings, as are changes in the value of
    the loans. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s net gains related to the
    ineffective portion of its fair value hedging instruments were
    insignificant. The net gains are included in financial services
    revenues.

Loan
    Commitments

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is
    party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are
    extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet
    certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, and related Derivatives
    Implementation Group conclusions, the Company classifies and
    accounts for IRLCs as non-designated derivative instruments at
    fair value. At September 30, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company’s IRLCs totaled $226.6 million and
    $647.7 million, respectively.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs
    through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments
    and hedging instruments as defined above. These instruments are
    considered non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at
    fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings.
    As of September 30, 2007, the Company had approximately
    $72.2 million of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments and $326.4 million outstanding of hedging
    instruments related to its uncommitted IRLCs.

The Company also purchases forward rate agreements (FRAs) and
    economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to
    potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on
    their home financing. At September 30, 2007, these
    potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately
    $124.9 million and were hedged with FRAs of
    $72.1 million and economic interest rate hedges of
    $526.9 million in EDFC put options and $29.6 million
    in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate
    hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months.
    These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and
    are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized
    in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended
    September 30, 2007 were not significant.

    that the value of these assets will be realized, which will be
    dependent in part on the Company’s ability to generate
    sufficient profits in future periods. If market conditions
    within the homebuilding industry do not improve or continue to
    worsen, it may affect the Company’s ability to fully
    realize the value of these assets, which may require a valuation
    adjustment and additional income tax expense in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and such
    expense could be material.

The following table sets forth the numerators and denominators
    used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per

    excluded from the computation of the loss per share because they

    For fiscal 2006, options to purchase 3.0 million shares of
    common stock were not included in the computation of diluted
    earnings per share because the exercise price was greater than
    the average market price of the common shares and their effect

In November 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the

    common stock. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased
    1,000,000 shares of its common stock at a total cost of
    $36.8 million. In November 2006, the Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $463.2 million of common
    stock, representing the remaining amount of the previous
    authorization. This authorization was in effect through
    November 30, 2007. As of September 30, 2007, all of
    the $463.2 million authorization was remaining. In November
    2007, the Board of Directors extended the $463.2 million
    common stock repurchase authorization to November 30, 2008.

Under the terms of the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan
    and 1991 Stock Incentive Plan, employees may use shares owned to
    satisfy the exercise price of stock options, which results in
    the Company’s purchase of those shares. Treasury stock at
    September 30, 2007 included 2,433 shares delivered to
    the Company during fiscal 2007 due to such transactions. These
    shares were not purchased under the Company’s share
    repurchase program and, therefore, had no effect on the
    remaining stock repurchase authorization.

During fiscal 2007, the Board of Directors declared quarterly
    cash dividends of $0.15 per common share, the last of which was
    paid on August 27, 2007 to stockholders of record on
    August 17, 2007. On October 24, 2007, the Board of
    Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share,
    which was paid on November 16, 2007, to stockholders of
    record on November 5, 2007.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred
    Compensation

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all Company employees who have
    been with the Company for a period of six months or more. The
    Company matches portions of employees’ voluntary
    contributions. Additional employer contributions in the form of
    profit sharing are at the discretion of the Company. Expenses
    for the plan were $12.2 million, $12.5 million and
    $9.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
    is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides
    benefits payable to certain management employees upon
    retirement, death, or termination of employment with the
    Company. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit
    based on a percentage of the eligible employees’ salaries,
    as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined
    formula. The Company’s liabilities related to the SERP were
    $10.5 million and $9.7 million at September 30,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recorded
    $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.8 million of
    expense for this plan in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a
    select group of employees. The participating employees designate
    investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not
    required to invest the contributions in the designated
    investments. The Company’s net liabilities related to the
    deferred compensation plan were $80.3 million and
    $80.8 million at September 30, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the
    employee contributions would have earned had the funds been
    invested in the designated investments. The Company recorded
    $13.0 million, $7.5 million and $7.6 million of
    expense for this plan in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides
    eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of
    the Company at a discounted price of at least 85% of the fair
    market value of the stock on the designated dates of purchase.
    The price may be further discounted depending on the average
    fair market value of the stock during the period and certain
    other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair
    market value of the common stock that an eligible employee may
    purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the
    employee’s annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan,
    employees of the Company

purchased 156,543 shares for $3.5 million in fiscal

    and 95,669 shares for $1.9 million in fiscal 2005.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which replaced the
    1991 Stock Incentive Plan, provides for the granting of stock
    options to certain key employees of the Company to purchase
    shares of common stock. Options are granted at exercise prices
    which equal the market value of the Company’s common stock
    at the date of the grant. Generally, the options vest over
    periods of 5 to 9.75 years and expire 10 years after
    the dates on which they were granted. Under the Plan, for awards
    other than options or stock appreciation rights, the shares
    available for issuance are to be reduced at the rate of
    1.75 shares for each share subject to the award. At
    September 30, 2007, there were 29.2 million shares
    available for future grants under the Plan.

On October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), which requires that companies measure
    and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the
    fair value of share-based payments granted under compensation
    arrangements. SFAS No. 123(R) was adopted using the
    modified prospective method. Results for fiscal 2005 have not
    been restated; however, SFAS No. 123(R) requires
    disclosure of pro forma information for periods prior to the
    adoption. The following table sets forth the effect on net
    income and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123(R)

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
    based on quoted market prices, where available, or are
    estimated. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in
    time based on relevant market information and information about
    the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in
    nature, involve matters of judgment and therefore, cannot be
    determined with precision. Estimated fair values are
    significantly affected by the assumptions used. The
    Company’s methods and assumptions used in estimating fair
    values are described below.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    payable, accrued expenses, the revolving credit facility, the
    mortgage warehouse facility, the commercial paper conduit
    facility and other secured notes payable as reported in the
    Company’s balance sheets approximate their fair values due
    to their short maturity or floating interest rate terms, as
    applicable.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has been named as defendant in various claims,
    complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Management believes that, while the outcome
    of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the
    liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the
    liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds management’s estimates reflected in the recorded
    liabilities relating to such matter, the Company could incur
    additional charges that could be significant.

The Company has recorded liabilities for contingencies occurring
    in the ordinary course of business, including warranty and
    construction defect claims on closed homes and the expected
    costs of the self-insured portion of general liability and
    workers compensation insurance claims. The Company’s
    estimates of such liabilities are based on the facts and
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends, including but not limited to costs relative to
    revenues, home closings and product types, and include estimates
    of the costs of unreported claims related to past operations.
    These liability estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are
    recorded in the accounting period in which the change in
    estimate occurs. The Company’s total liabilities for such
    items were $387.0 million and $361.2 million at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On June 15, 2007, a putative class action,

John R.
    Yeatman, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.

, was filed
    by one of the Company’s customers against it and its
    affiliated mortgage company subsidiary in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The
    complaint seeks certification of a class alleged to include
    persons who, within the year preceding the filing of the suit,
    purchased a home from the Company



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and obtained a mortgage for such purchase from its affiliated
    mortgage company subsidiary. The complaint alleges that the
    Company violated Section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement
    Procedures Act by effectively requiring its homebuyers to use
    its affiliated mortgage company to finance their home purchases
    by offering certain discounts and incentives. The action seeks
    damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief.
    Management believes the claims alleged in this action are
    without merit and will defend them vigorously. However, as this
    action is still in its early stages, the Company is unable to
    express an opinion as to the likelihood of an unfavorable
    outcome or the amount of damages, if any; consequently, the
    Company has not recorded any associated liabilities in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land
    and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. At September 30, 2007,
    the Company had total deposits of $109.3 million, comprised
    of cash deposits of $95.8 million, promissory notes of
    $7.4 million, and letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $6.1 million, to purchase land and lots with a total
    remaining purchase price of $1.8 billion. Within the land
    and lot option purchase contracts in force at September 30,
    2007, there were a limited number of contracts, representing
    only $60.8 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require the Company to
    purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting certain
    obligations.

Included in the total deposits of $109.3 million, were
    $34.4 million of deposits related to land option purchase
    contracts for which the Company does not expect to exercise its
    option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not
    yet been terminated. The remaining purchase price of those
    contracts was $548.5 million. Consequently, the deposits
    relating to these contracts have been written off, resulting in
    a net deposit balance of $74.9 million at
    September 30, 2007. The majority of land and lots under
    contract are currently expected to be purchased within three
    years, based on the Company’s assumptions as to the extent
    it will exercise its options to purchase such land and lots.

Additionally, in the normal course of its business activities,
    the Company provides standby letters of credit and surety bonds,
    issued by third parties, to secure performance under various
    contracts. At September 30, 2007, outstanding standby
    letters of credit were $97.7 million and surety bonds were
    $2.1 billion. The Company has additional capacity of
    $902.3 million for standby letters of credit under its
    revolving credit facility.

The Company leases office space and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum annual lease payments
    under these leases at September 30, 2007 approximate (in
    millions):

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The Company’s seven homebuilding operating regions and its
    financial services operation are its operating segments under
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.” The seven homebuilding
    operating regions are presented as separate reportable segments.
    Previously, the Company presented six homebuilding reporting
    segments, aggregating both its Northeast and Midwest operating
    regions into its Northeast reporting segment. However, because
    of a realignment of the Company’s management structure
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Colorado markets
    are now included in its Midwest operating region, rather than in
    its Southwest operating region. As a result, the Company
    determined that each of its seven homebuilding operating regions
    constitutes a reportable segment, as reflected in the current
    year presentation. All prior year segment information has been
    restated to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation.

Under the revised presentation, the Company’s reportable
    homebuilding segments are: Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South
    Central, Southwest, California and West. These reporting
    segments have homebuilding operations located in the following
    states:

Northeast:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona, New Mexico and Utah

California:

California and Nevada (Reno only)

West:

Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington

Consequently, the Company has restated the prior year segment
    information provided in this note to conform to the current year
    presentation.

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating 98%
    of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. The
    Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily engaged in
    the acquisition and development of land for residential purposes
    and the construction and sale of residential homes on such land,
    in 27 states and 83 markets in the United States. The
    homebuilding segments generate most of their revenues from the
    sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of
    land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage
    banking and title agency services principally to customers of
    the Company’s homebuilding segments. The Company generally
    does not retain or service the mortgages that it originates,
    but, rather, sells the mortgages and related servicing rights to
    investors. The financial services segment generates its revenues
    from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for
    title insurance agency and closing services.

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are described
    throughout Note A.

The Company experiences variability in its results of operations
    from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of its
    homebuilding business. Historically, the Company has closed a
    greater number of homes in the third and fourth (June and
    September) fiscal quarters than in the first and second
    (December and March) fiscal quarters. As a result, revenues and
    net income typically have been higher in the third and fourth
    quarters of the fiscal year; however, in fiscal 2007, due to
    softening market conditions in many of the markets in which the
    Company operates, approximately half (51%) of its consolidated
    revenues were attributable to operations in the third and fourth
    fiscal quarters, and the Company incurred consolidated operating
    losses in those quarters.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, an impairment charge
    in the amount of $142.0 million was recorded as a reduction
    of gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
    Additionally, the Company wrote off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts
    it no longer planned to pursue in the amount of
    $57.1 million and $57.2 million as a reduction of
    gross profit in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006,
    respectively.

During fiscal 2007, gross profit was reduced by inventory
    impairment charges of $40.9 million, $67.3 million,
    $835.8 million and $278.3 million, and write-offs of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs of
    $36.8 million, $13.9 million, $16.2 million and
    $40.3 million in the first, second, third and fourth
    quarters, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142 as discussed in the
    Company’s goodwill accounting policies in Note D,
    goodwill impairment charges of $425.6 million and
    $48.5 million were recorded as a reduction of income in the
    third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, respectively. There
    were no goodwill impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2006.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that
    evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or
    otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed
    in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure.

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2007 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
    control over financial reporting is not intended to provide
    absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial
    statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with internal control policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
    concluded that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2007.
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2007, and their report is
    included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.

We have audited D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of September 30, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2007 of D.R.
    Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated
    November 26, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
