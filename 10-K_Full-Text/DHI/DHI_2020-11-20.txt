D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K



PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 88 markets across 29 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton,

America’s Builder

, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Our homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing markets, start-up operations in new markets and acquisitions of other homebuilding companies. Our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse. Our homes range in size from 1,000 to more than 4,000 square feet and in price from $150,000 to more than $1,000,000. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we closed 65,388 homes with an average closing price of $299,100.

Our business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business, generating 97% of our consolidated revenues of $20.3 billion, $17.6 billion and $16.1 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 91% of our home sales revenue in fiscal 2020 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.

Our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. In recent years, we have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers across our markets. Our entry-level homes at affordable price points have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand.

During fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FOR.” Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational and capital efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts. At September 30, 2020, we owned 65% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock.

Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our 100% owned subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.

In addition to our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, we have subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other.

OPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES

Following is an overview of our company’s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance.

Homebuilding Markets

Our homebuilding business operates in 88 markets across 29 states, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business.



We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our financial services operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional information regarding segment performance.



When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Employment levels and job growth;

•

Income level of potential homebuyers;

•

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized;

•

Market for homes at our targeted price points;

•

Availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

Availability of qualified subcontractors;

•

New and secondary home sales activity;

•

Competition;

•

Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing; and

•

Performance capabilities of our local management team.

Economies of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal 2020 as measured by number of homes closed, and we are also one of the largest builders in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships;

•

Volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and

•

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively across our markets.

Decentralized Homebuilding Operations

We view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers in making operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local market conditions, have the best information to make many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2020, we had 53 separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller and accounting personnel; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance-based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions, and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices.



Operating Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements;

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and

— Financial analysis of the potential project;

•

Negotiating lot purchase, land acquisition and related contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals;

•

Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•

Selecting building and architectural plans;

•

Selecting home construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes;

•

Planning and managing home construction schedules;

•

Determining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community;

•

Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans;

•

Coordinating all interactions with customers and real estate brokers during the sales, construction and home closing processes; and

•

Ensuring the quality and timeliness of post-closing service and warranty repairs provided to customers.

Centralized Controls

We centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have five separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region president, a chief financial officer, legal counsel and other operational and office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels;

•

Monitoring division financial and operating performance; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans.



Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Monitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Technology systems to support management of operations, marketing and financial information;

•

Accounting and management reporting;

•

Income taxes;

•

Internal audit;

•

Public reporting and investor and media relations;

•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Administration, reporting and monitoring of customer satisfaction surveys and resolutions of issues; and

•

Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans.

Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management

We acquire land for use in our homebuilding and Forestar operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions or for other strategic reasons.

We also enter into land/lot contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. These contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership.



We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures. Joint ventures are consolidated if we have a controlling interest, or accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have a significant influence, but not control.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by:

•

Controlling our level of inventory investment and managing our supply of land/lots owned and controlled under purchase contracts to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends;

•

Utilizing land/lot purchase contracts and seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision.

Land Development and Home Construction

Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to local homebuyers’ expectations for affordability, home size and features, and our local management teams adjust product offerings to meet buyer demand as necessary. In many communities, we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We complete the construction of most homes within two to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option.

We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. At times, we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in certain communities.

Cost Controls

We control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations.



We control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions, monitoring staffing and compensation levels and by applying technology to business processes to improve productivity where practical. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives, which we believe are efficient uses of our marketing expenditures.

Marketing and Sales

We primarily use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes brand names to market and sell our homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings, focusing primarily on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entry-level buyers who are focused on affordability. Our Freedom Homes brand offers homes at affordable price points to active adult buyers seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle. The percentage of home closings and home sales revenue contributed by each brand during fiscal 2020 was as follows:

We also use names of acquired companies for a period of time after the acquisition. We currently utilize the Pacific Ridge Homes brand in our Seattle, Washington market; the Lexington Homes brand in our Spokane, Washington market; and the Terramor Homes brand in our Raleigh, North Carolina market. The product offerings in all of these markets are similar to, and included with, our D.R. Horton branded communities shown above.

We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options, when available. We train and inform our sales personnel regarding construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives, such as discounts or free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market or to attain our targeted sales pace.

We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers digitally, through email, search engine marketing, social media and our company website and other real estate websites, in addition to print media and advertisement. We also use billboards, radio, television, magazine and newspaper advertising locally as necessary. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play an important role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes.

We also build speculative homes in most of our communities, which allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.



Sales Contracts and Backlog

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and communities. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 2020, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $8.2 billion (26,683 homes), an increase of 98% from $4.1 billion (13,613 homes) at September 30, 2019. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $306,800 at September 30, 2020, up slightly from the $304,100 average at September 30, 2019. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were 20% in fiscal 2020 compared to 21% in fiscal 2019.

The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from one to six months; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2020 are scheduled to close in fiscal 2021.

Customer Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers’ post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified products installed in the home.

Single-Family Rental Properties

During fiscal 2020, several of our homebuilding divisions began constructing and leasing homes as single-family rental properties. After these rental properties are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the properties in each community are expected to be marketed in bulk for sale. At September 30, 2020, our homebuilding fixed assets included $87.2 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform representing approximately 740 single-family rental homes and finished lots, including approximately 440 completed homes. There were no bulk sales of single-family rental properties in fiscal 2020.

Forestar Residential Lot Development Operations

During fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar. Forestar is a residential lot development company with operations in 49 markets across 21 states as of September 30, 2020. We owned approximately 65% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2020. Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts. Forestar’s strategy is focused on making investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented U.S. lot development industry. Our homebuilding operations acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. A shared services agreement is in place whereby we provide Forestar certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services. As the controlling shareholder of Forestar, we have significant influence in guiding the strategic direction and operations of Forestar.



Customer Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers. During the year ended September 30, 2020, DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 68% of our total homes closed, and approximately 97% of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions also work with additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers.

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting.

Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers.

Insurance Agency

Through our insurance agency subsidiary, we collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers.

Multi-Family Rental Properties

Through DHI Communities, a 100% owned subsidiary, we develop, construct and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. DHI Communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After DHI Communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. DHI Communities had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at September 30, 2020. These six projects represent 1,730 multi-family units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, DHI Communities sold multi-family rental properties for a total of $128.5 million and $133.4 million, respectively, and recorded gains on sale totaling $59.4 million and $51.9 million. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, our consolidated balance sheets included $246.2 million and $204.0 million, respectively, of assets related to DHI Communities.

Human Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2020, we employ 9,716 people, of whom 6,818 work in our homebuilding operations, 2,163 in our financial services segment, 463 at our corporate office, 143 for our Forestar subsidiary and 129 in our other businesses. Of our homebuilding employees, 2,666 are involved in construction, 1,996 are sales and marketing personnel and 2,156 are office personnel.

We believe the people who work for our company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Additional information about our employee benefit plans is included in Note K.



Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees. Our focus on retention is evident in the length of service of our executive, regional and divisional management teams. The average tenure of our executive team and homebuilding region presidents is 27 years and the average tenure of our homebuilding division presidents and city managers is greater than 10 years.

We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination.

During fiscal 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19), we increased the number of employees in all of our operating segments and kept all of our employee compensation and benefit plans intact. We have implemented safety protocols to protect our employees and our homebuyers during the pandemic. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification, including some of our workforce working remotely. Our experienced teams of people adapted to the changes in our work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time.

Business Acquisitions

We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. Acquisitions of homebuilding and related businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through purchase contracts. Also, employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time.

Competition

The homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders and developers for homebuyers, desirable land, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of price, location, quality, design and mortgage financing terms.

The competitors to our financial services businesses include other mortgage lenders and title companies, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital, and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do. We strive to provide flexible, fairly priced financing alternatives subject to applicable regulations.



Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements.

Our homebuilding and land development operations are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular compliance requirements for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.

Our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.



ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be read together with the risk factors set forth below. They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may become subject to, many of which are difficult to predict or beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse manner.

Risks Related to our Business and our Industry

Public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect our business or financial results.

The U.S. and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health and public perception of health risk. In December 2019, C-19 emerged in the Wuhan region of China and subsequently spread worldwide. The World Health Organization declared C-19 a pandemic, resulting in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, requiring closure of non-essential businesses for a period of time. In almost all of the municipalities across the U.S. where we operate, residential construction and financial services have been deemed essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure, and we have continued our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations in those markets where allowed. We implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.

Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence and consumer confidence. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long C-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence, demand for our homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers. The extent to which C-19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of C-19 and the impact on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If C-19 has a significant negative impact on economic conditions over a prolonged period of time, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

The homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic, real estate or other conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial results.

The homebuilding and lot development industries are cyclical and are significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

consumer confidence and spending;

•

housing demand;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

availability and prices of new homes for sale and alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed homes, homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other existing homes and rental properties; and

•

demographic trends.

Adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on our business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and writeoffs. Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others. If adverse conditions affect our larger markets, they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other homebuilding companies.

In the past, the federal government’s fiscal and trade policies and economic stimulus actions have created uncertainty in the financial markets and caused volatility in interest rates, which impacted business and consumer behavior. Monetary policy actions affecting interest rates or fiscal policy actions and new legislation related to taxation, spending levels or borrowing limits, along with the related political debates, conflicts and compromises associated with such actions, may negatively impact the financial markets and consumer confidence. Such events could hurt the U.S. economy and the housing market and in turn, could adversely affect the operating results of our businesses.



Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, heavy or prolonged precipitation or wildfires, can harm our business. These can delay our development work, home construction and home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor or damage homes under construction. The climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate, including California, Florida, Texas and other coastal areas, where we have some of our larger operations and which have experienced recent natural disasters, present increased risks of adverse weather or natural disasters.

Deployments of U.S. military personnel to foreign regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to national security and any corresponding response by the United States or others, domestic or international instability or civil unrest may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where we operate, which could adversely affect our business.

If we experience any of the foregoing, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes. In the future, our pricing and product strategies may also be limited by market conditions. We may be unable to change the mix of our home offerings, reduce the costs of the homes we build, offer more affordable homes or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways without adversely affecting our profits and returns. In addition, cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase if homebuyers do not honor their contracts due to any of the factors discussed above.

Our financial services business is closely related to our homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters will also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages or may increase our recourse obligations for previous originations. We may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to third-party purchasers in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of primary mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in the connection with the loan, and we may be required to repurchase certain of those mortgage loans or provide indemnification. Repurchased mortgage loans and/or the settlement of claims associated with such loans could adversely affect our business or financial results. We establish reserves for estimated losses and future repurchase obligations for mortgage loans we have sold; however, actual future obligations related to these mortgages could differ significantly from our current estimated amounts.

Constriction of the credit and public capital markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital.

During past economic and housing downturns, the credit markets constricted and reduced some sources of liquidity that were previously available to us. Consequently, we relied principally on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness during those times. There likely will be periods in the future when financial market upheaval will increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to access the public debt markets or obtain bank financing.

Our homebuilding operations utilize a $1.59 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. Our 5-year homebuilding revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the revolving credit commitment. The maturity date of the 5-year facility is October 2, 2024. We also have a $375 million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $550 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The maturity date of the 364-day facility is May 27, 2021. Forestar and its subsidiaries, our financial services subsidiaries, and certain of our other subsidiaries are not guarantors under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities or our homebuilding senior notes.

Forestar has a $380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $570 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The Forestar revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the revolving credit commitment. The maturity date of the facility is October 2, 2022. The Forestar revolving credit facility is guaranteed by Forestar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries that are not immaterial subsidiaries or have not been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. The Forestar revolving credit facility is not guaranteed by us or our other subsidiaries.



Our mortgage subsidiary utilizes a $1.35 billion mortgage repurchase facility to finance the majority of the loans it originates. The capacity of the facility increased, without requiring additional commitments, to $1.575 billion for approximately 45 days around September 30, 2020 and increases again for approximately 30 days around December 31, 2020. The capacity can also be increased to $1.8 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. The mortgage repurchase facility must be renewed annually and currently expires on February 19, 2021. We expect to renew and extend the term of the mortgage repurchase facility with similar terms prior to its maturity. Adverse changes in market conditions could make the renewal of these facilities more difficult or could result in an increase in the cost of these facilities or a decrease in the committed amounts. Such changes affecting our mortgage repurchase facility may also make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate.

We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities. At September 30, 2020, $394.3 million remained available, and $100 million of this availability is reserved for sales under Forestar’s at-the-market equity offering program established in August 2020. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations, including the maturity of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our homebuilding senior notes in fiscal 2021. Adverse changes in economic, homebuilding or capital market conditions due to C-19 or otherwise could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results, restrict our ability to obtain additional capital or increase our costs of capital.

Reductions in the availability of mortgage financing provided by government agencies, changes in government financing programs, a decrease in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase in mortgage interest rates could decrease our buyers’ ability to obtain financing and adversely affect our business or financial results.

The mortgage loans originated by our financial services operations are primarily eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae and are typically sold to third-party purchasers. The secondary market for mortgage loans continues to primarily desire securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, and we believe the liquidity these agencies provide to the mortgage industry is important to the housing market. Any significant change regarding the long-term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could result in adjustments to the size of their loan portfolios and to guidelines for their loan products. Additionally, a reduction in the availability of financing provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans. During fiscal 2020, approximately 66% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae and 28% were sold to two other major financial entities. On an ongoing basis, we seek to establish loan purchase arrangements with additional financial entities. If we are unable to sell mortgage loans to purchasers on attractive terms, our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited, which would negatively affect our profitability.

The FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit requirements and is an important source for financing the sale of our homes. Changes, restrictions or significant premium increases in FHA programs in the future may negatively affect the availability or affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect our ability to sell homes.

Some of our customers may qualify for 100% financing through programs offered by the VA and the USDA and certain other housing finance agencies. These programs are subject to changes in regulations, lending standards and government funding levels. There can be no assurances that these programs or other programs will continue to be available in our homebuilding markets or that they will be as attractive to our customers as the programs currently offered, which could negatively affect our sales.



Mortgage rates are currently low compared to most historical periods; however, market conditions could change causing mortgage rates to rise in the future. When interest rates increase, the cost of owning a home increases, which will likely reduce the number of potential homebuyers who can obtain mortgage financing and could result in a decline in the demand for our homes.

In the latter part of fiscal 2020, due to reduced liquidity in the secondary market related to remedies provided in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to borrowers of residential loans, we began retaining mortgage servicing rights on some of our originations. As servicer for these loans, we may have to advance payments to the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) bondholders to the extent there are insufficient collections to satisfy the required principal and interest remittances of the underlying mortgage-backed securities.

The risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely affect our business or financial results.

Inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding and Forestar businesses. There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land. If housing demand declines, we may not be able to build and sell homes profitably in some of our communities, and we may not be able to fully recover the costs of some of the land and lots we own. Also, the values of our owned undeveloped land, lots and housing inventories may fluctuate significantly due to changes in market conditions. As a result, our deposits for lots controlled under purchase contracts may be put at risk, we may have to sell homes or land for a lower profit margin or record inventory impairment charges on our land and lots. A significant deterioration in economic or homebuilding industry conditions may result in substantial inventory impairment charges.

We cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies, acquisitions or investments will be successful or will not expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences.

In recent years, we have primarily grown our business by increasing our investments in land, lot and home inventories in our existing homebuilding markets. We have also expanded through investments in new product offerings, new geographic markets, and the growth of our multi-family rental property operations. Investments in land, lots, home inventories and rental properties can expose us to risks of economic loss and asset impairments if housing conditions weaken or if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategies.

In October 2017, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar and at September 30, 2020, we owned 65% of its outstanding shares. Forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 49 markets across 21 states as of September 30, 2020. Forestar’s strategy is focused on making significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its residential lot development business across a geographically diversified national platform and consolidating market share in the fragmented U.S. lot development industry. Our homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies, and we provide Forestar certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services through a shared services agreement. As the controlling shareholder of Forestar, we strongly influence the strategic direction and operations of Forestar.

In addition to the investment and merger with Forestar, we have acquired the homebuilding operations of several homebuilding companies in recent years, and we may make strategic acquisitions of or investments in other companies, operations or assets in the future. Such acquisitions and investments may have risks similar to those related to land, lots and home inventories, but they may also expose us to additional risks or other negative consequences. These transactions may not advance our business strategy, provide a satisfactory return on our investment or provide other benefits we anticipate. Also, the integration of these transactions may not be successful and may require significant time and resources, which may divert management’s attention from other operations. Acquisitions and investments could also expose us to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process and may lead to litigation. If these transactions under-perform our expectations or are unsuccessful, we may incur significant expenses or write-offs of inventory, other assets or intangible assets such as goodwill. Acquisitions and investments can result in dilution to existing stockholders if we issue our common stock as consideration and can increase our debt levels or reduce our liquidity if we purchase them with cash. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to identify suitable additional markets or acquisition candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial position and general economic and business conditions. We also may seek to divest an investment or a business and may have difficulty selling such investment or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner.



Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation, higher interest rates or deflation.

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing affordability. In a highly inflationary environment, depending on industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. Moreover, in a highly inflationary environment, our cost of capital, labor and materials can increase and the purchasing power of our cash resources can decline, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.

Alternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could lead to deterioration in economic conditions, including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of existing homes. If oil prices decline significantly, economic conditions in markets that have significant exposure to the energy sector may weaken. These, or other factors that increase the risk of significant deflation, could have a negative impact on our business or financial results.

Homebuilding is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.

We are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. We rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and obtain construction materials. Despite our detailed specifications and monitoring of the construction process, our subcontractors occasionally do not meet adequate quality standards in the construction of our homes. When we find these issues, we repair them in accordance with our warranty obligations. We spend significant resources to repair items in homes we have sold to fulfill the warranties we issued to our homebuyers. Additionally, we are subject to construction defect claims which can be costly to defend and resolve in the legal system. Warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity in the media and on the internet, which can damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell homes.

Based on the large number of homes we have sold over the years, our potential liabilities related to warranty and construction defect claims are significant. As a consequence, we maintain product liability insurance, and we seek to obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their workmanship and materials. We establish warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our future warranty and construction defect claims. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is limited and costly. We have responded to increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted or become more costly. If costs to resolve our future warranty and construction defect claims exceed our estimates, our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected.

A health and safety incident relating to our operations could be costly in terms of potential liability and reputational damage.

Building and land development sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the homebuilding and lot development industries poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of homes we construct, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our business. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly and could expose us to liability that could be costly. Such an incident could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation, our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, and our ability to attract customers and employees, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity.



Supply shortages and other risks related to acquiring land, building materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay deliveries.

The homebuilding and lot development industries have from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of construction, including:

•

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers want to live;

•

shortages of qualified subcontractors;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, manufacturers, distributors and land developers who may be inadequately capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

significant increases in the cost of materials, particularly increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are significant components of home construction costs.

In addition, tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions imposed or increased on imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes, including steel, aluminum and lumber, may raise our costs for these items or for the products made with them.

These factors may cause construction delays or cause us to incur more costs building our homes. If the level of new home demand increases significantly in future periods, the risk of shortages and cost increases in residential lots, labor and materials available to the homebuilding industry will likely increase.

We are required to obtain performance bonds, the unavailability of which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

We often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. At September 30, 2020, we had $1.8 billion of outstanding surety bonds. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and other factors, including the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Increases in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or financial results.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage loan interest and state and local income and property taxes, have historically been deductible expenses for an individual’s federal income taxes, subject to various limitations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became effective January 1, 2018, established new limits on these federal tax deductions that could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership. These or any further changes in income tax laws by the federal or state government to eliminate or substantially reduce income tax benefits associated with homeownership, could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes, especially in areas with relatively high housing prices or high taxes.

In addition, increases in property tax rates by local governmental authorities, as experienced in some areas in response to reduced federal and state funding, could adversely affect the amount of financing our potential customers could obtain or their desire to purchase new homes.



Governmental regulations and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our land development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction, including zoning, density restrictions, building design and building standards. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved, if approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads or other local services. New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of these may limit, delay or increase the costs of development or home construction.

We are also subject to a significant number and variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety, labor standards and the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available. These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Government agencies also routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our business that can be significant. For example, we have received Notices of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in our Southeast region. This matter could potentially result in requirements for us to perform additional compliance procedures and to pay monetary sanctions.

Government restrictions, standards, or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or potential climate change impacts are likely to result in restrictions on land development in certain areas and may increase energy, transportation, or raw material costs, which could reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations. This is a particular concern in the western United States, where some of the most extensive and stringent environmental laws and residential building construction standards in the country have been enacted, and where we have business operations.

The subcontractors we rely on to perform the actual construction of our homes are also subject to a significant number of local, state and federal laws and regulations, including laws involving matters that are not within our control. If the subcontractors who construct our homes fail to comply with all applicable laws, we can suffer reputational damage, and may be exposed to possible liability.

We are also subject to an extensive number of laws and regulations because our common stock and debt securities and the common stock of our Forestar subsidiary are publicly traded in the capital markets. These regulations govern our communications with our shareholders and the capital markets, our financial statement disclosures and our legal processes, and they also impact the work required to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and our legal counsel. Changes in these laws and regulations, including the subsequent implementation of rules by the administering government authorities, may require us to incur additional compliance costs, and such costs may be significant.

Governmental regulation of our financial services operations could adversely affect our business or financial results.

Our financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the CFPB, Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies. Additional future regulations or changing rule interpretations and examinations by regulatory agencies may result in more stringent compliance standards and could adversely affect the results of our operations.



Homebuilding, lot development and financial services are competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results.

The homebuilding and lot development industries are highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We compete with local, regional and national homebuilders and developers, and also with existing home sales, foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can negatively affect our sales volumes, selling prices and incentive levels, reduce our profit margins, and cause the value of our inventory or other assets to be impaired. Competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms, or cause delays in land development or in the construction of our homes.

The competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and have greater access to capital than we do, and some of them may operate with different lending criteria than we do. These competitors may offer a broader or more attractive array of financing and other products and services to potential customers than we do.

Our businesses compete with other companies across all industries to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services of these individuals increases as business conditions improve in the homebuilding, lot development and financial services industries and in the general economy. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees, managers or executives, our business could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to our Indebtedness

We have significant amounts of debt and may incur additional debt, which could affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations or potential acquisitions.

As of September 30, 2020, our consolidated debt was $4.3 billion, which consisted of $2.5 billion related to our homebuilding segment, $1.1 billion related to our financial services segment and $641.1 million related to our Forestar segment. We had $1.6 billion principal amount of our debt maturing before the end of fiscal 2021, including $400 million principal amount of homebuilding senior notes and $1.1 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility. The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt by us or our homebuilding subsidiaries or the incurrence of secured or unsecured debt by our non-guarantor subsidiaries, and the agreements governing our homebuilding revolving credit facilities allow us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt. Also, the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes and the agreements governing our homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability and on that of the guarantors under our homebuilding senior notes and our homebuilding revolving credit facilities to incur debt secured by certain assets, but still permit us and our homebuilding subsidiaries to incur significant amounts of additional secured debt. The Forestar revolving credit facility and the indentures governing Forestar’s senior notes impose restrictions on the ability of Forestar and its restricted subsidiaries to incur secured and unsecured debt, but still permit Forestar and its subsidiaries to incur a substantial amount of future secured and unsecured debt, and do not restrict the incurrence of future secured and unsecured debt by Forestar’s unrestricted subsidiaries.

The amount and the maturities of our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries could have important consequences. For example, possible consequences for our homebuilding, financial services and Forestar operations each with respect to their individual debt obligations, could:

•

require the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payment of debt and reduce the ability to use cash flow for other operating or investing purposes;

•

limit the flexibility to adjust to changes in business or economic conditions; and

•

limit the ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other requirements.



Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we or our subsidiaries may not have sufficient cash flow from our respective businesses to pay our substantial debt.

Our ability and that of our subsidiaries to meet our respective debt service obligations will depend, in part, upon our and our subsidiaries’ future financial performance. Future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our businesses are also affected by financial, political, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of debt or equity, the refinancing of debt or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the cost of our debt service obligations, because borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and mortgage repurchase facility bear interest at floating rates.

The instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ business, and the ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with related covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ financial condition or operating flexibility.

The restrictions imposed by our and certain of our subsidiaries’ indebtedness could limit our or our subsidiaries’ ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, engage in sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain assets, incur secured debt, create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities, sell certain assets and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The instruments governing Forestar’s indebtedness contain restrictions on the ability of Forestar and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends and make other distributions on or redeem or repurchase equity securities, sell certain assets, enter into affiliate transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of Forestar’s assets.

In addition, the agreements governing certain of our and our subsidiaries’ debt instruments contain the following financial covenants:

Homebuilding revolving credit facilities.

Our homebuilding revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.

Forestar’s revolving credit facility.

The Forestar revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance by Forestar of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity, a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction based on the book value of Forestar’s real estate assets and unrestricted cash. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under this revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.

Mortgage repurchase facility and other restrictions.

The mortgage repurchase facility for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity by our mortgage subsidiary. A failure to comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds to our mortgage subsidiary or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. Any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly.

In addition, although our financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by the indentures governing our senior notes or the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities, the ability of our financial services subsidiaries to distribute funds to our homebuilding operations would be restricted in the event such distribution would cause an event of default under the mortgage repurchase facility or if an event of default had occurred



under this facility. Moreover, our right to receive assets from our financial services subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims we may have to funds from our financial services subsidiaries would be subordinate to subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our claims.

Our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our debt ratings.

Our homebuilding senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings. Any lowering of our debt ratings could make accessing the public capital markets or obtaining additional credit from banks more difficult and/or more expensive. Any lowering of Forestar’s debt ratings could also make Forestar’s ability to access the public capital markets or obtain additional credit from banks more difficult and/or more expensive.

The instruments governing our indebtedness contain change of control provisions which could affect the timing of repayment.

Change of control purchase options under our homebuilding senior notes and change of control default under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities.

Upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a ratings downgrade event, each as defined in the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moreover, a change of control (as defined in our homebuilding revolving credit facilities) would constitute an event of default under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facilities, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder. If repayment of more than $50 million outstanding under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities were accelerated and such acceleration were not rescinded or such indebtedness were not satisfied, in either case within 30 days, an event of default would result under the indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes, entitling the trustee for the notes or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the relevant series of notes then outstanding to declare all such notes to be due and payable immediately. If purchase offers were required under the indentures for our homebuilding senior notes, repayment of the borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facilities were required, or if the senior notes were accelerated, we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.

Change of control purchase option under Forestar’s notes and change of control default under the Forestar revolving credit facility.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures governing Forestar’s notes), Forestar will be required to offer to repurchase Forestar’s notes at 101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A change of control (as defined in the Forestar revolving credit facility) with respect to Forestar would constitute an event of default under the Forestar revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the facility, a requirement to cash collateralize all letters of credit outstanding thereunder and the termination of the commitments thereunder. If the maturity of the Forestar revolving credit facility and/or other indebtedness of Forestar and its restricted subsidiaries together having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $40 million or more is accelerated, an event of default would result under the indentures governing the Forestar notes, entitling the trustee for the Forestar notes or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Forestar notes to declare all such Forestar notes to be due and payable immediately. If purchase offers were required under the indentures for Forestar’s notes, repayment of the borrowings under Forestar’s revolving credit facility were required, or if Forestar’s notes were accelerated, we can give no assurance that Forestar would have sufficient funds to pay the required amounts.

General Risk Factors

Damage to our corporate reputation or brands from negative publicity could adversely affect our business, financial results and/or stock price.

Adverse publicity related to our company, industry, personnel, operations or business performance may cause damage to our corporate reputation or brands and may generate negative sentiment, potentially affecting the performance of our business or our stock price, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy. Negative publicity can be disseminated rapidly through digital platforms, including social media, websites, blogs and newsletters. Customers and other interested parties value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without



regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction, and our success in preserving our brand image depends on our ability to recognize, respond to and effectively manage negative publicity in a rapidly changing environment. Adverse publicity or unfavorable commentary from any source could damage our reputation, reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our business.

Our business could be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel.

We rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our businesses. Specifically, our success depends heavily on the performance of our homebuilding division and region presidents and their management teams, our financial services management team, our corporate office management teams, our Forestar management team and our executive officers. These key personnel have significant experience and skills in the homebuilding, lot development and financial services industries, as well as leadership and management abilities that are important to our success. We seek to retain our key personnel and to have succession plans in place to address the potential loss of key personnel. However, if our retention and succession planning efforts are unsuccessful or if we fail to attract suitable replacements, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.

Information technology failures, data security breaches, and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations could harm our business.

We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, third-party software and data storage providers and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and service outages in the past. Our normal business activities involve collecting and storing information specific to our homebuyers, employees, vendors and suppliers and maintaining operational and financial information related to our business, both in an office setting and remote locations as needed. A material breach in the security of our information technology systems or other data security controls could include the theft or release of this information. A data security breach, a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or a breach of any of our data security controls could disrupt our business operations, damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, adversely impact our sales and revenue and require us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. The unintended or unauthorized disclosure of personal identifying and confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by the affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators. The outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.

We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures, security breaches, and the failure to satisfy privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the future as legal requirements continue to increase. The European Union and other international regulators, as well as state governments, have recently enacted or enhanced data privacy regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other governments are considering establishing similar or stronger protections. These regulations impose certain obligations for handling specified personal information in our systems, and for apprising individuals of the information we have collected about them. We have incurred costs in an effort to comply with these requirements, and our costs may increase significantly if new requirements are enacted and based on how individuals exercise their rights. Any noncompliance could result in our incurring substantial penalties and reputational damage, and also could result in litigation.

We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data. Our increased use of remote work environments and virtual platforms in response to C-19 may also increase our risk of cyber-attack or data security breaches. We use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Consequently, we cannot provide assurances that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.



ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our homebuilding and Forestar operations own inventories of land, lots and homes, and DHI Communities owns multi-family rental properties that are both completed and under construction as part of the ordinary course of our business. We also own office buildings totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet, and we lease approximately 570,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring through February 2026. These properties are located in our various operating markets to house our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices.

We own ranch land and improvements totaling 93,600 acres, most of which has been owned for approximately 20 years. We use this land to conduct ranching and agricultural activities and to host company meetings and events.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that could be significant.

In fiscal 2013, our mortgage subsidiary was subpoenaed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the adequacy of certain underwriting and quality control processes related to Federal Housing Administration loans originated and sold in prior years. We have provided information related to these loans and our processes to the

DOJ, and communications are ongoing. The DOJ has to date not asserted any formal claim amount, penalty or fine.

In May and July of 2014, we received Notices of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) related to stormwater compliance at certain of our sites in our Southeast region. This matter could potentially result in monetary sanctions to the Company; however, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that this matter would result in a loss that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We are participating in settlement discussions with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) and DOJ concerning alleged violations of the wetlands provisions of the Clean Water Act at a development site in our Southeast region relating to a violation notice the ACOE issued in April 2017. This matter could potentially result in a settlement that includes a penalty of approximately $350,000 without an admission of liability. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that this matter will result in a loss that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

With respect to administrative or judicial proceedings involving the environment, we have determined that in future filings we will disclose any such proceeding if we reasonably believe such proceeding will result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, at or in excess of $1 million. We believe that such threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of environmental proceedings that are material to our business or financial condition.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations — Overview

Fiscal 2020 Operating Results

In fiscal 2020, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 15% and 16%, respectively, compared to the prior year, and our consolidated revenues increased 15% to $20.3 billion compared to $17.6 billion in the prior year. Our pre-tax income was $3.0 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019, and our pre-tax operating margin was 14.7% compared to 12.1%. Net income was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year. The current year results include a tax benefit of $93.4 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit.

Cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, our return on equity (ROE) was 22.1% compared to 17.2% in fiscal 2019, and our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 24.6% compared to 18.1%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the year divided by average stockholders’ equity, where average stockholders’ equity is the sum of ending stockholders’ equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the year divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.

Within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 70% of the lots owned and controlled at September 30, 2020 compared to 60% at September 30, 2019. Our relationship with Forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to increase the controlled portion of our finished lot pipeline.

COVID-19

During the latter part of March 2020, the impacts of C-19 and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to adversely affect our business. However, residential construction and financial services were designated as essential businesses in almost all of our markets, which allowed us to continue to operate during that time. We implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.

During April 2020 when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for many markets across the United States, we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders, and net sales orders for April were 1% lower than the same month in the prior year. However, as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders began to be lifted, our weekly sales pace increased significantly, and our cancellation rate returned to normal levels. For the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, our net sales orders increased by 38% and 81%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarters.

We believe the increase in demand in the second half of the year was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from mid-March through early April, which caused some pent-up demand. We were and remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory.

However, even with the resurgence of demand in our third and fourth quarters, we remain cautious as to the ongoing impact of C-19 on our operations and on the overall economy. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long C-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence, demand for our homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers. The extent to which this impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of C-19 and the impact on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.



We believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.

Strategy

Our operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. We have made operational adjustments as a result of C-19; however, our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:

•

Developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.

•

Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.

•

Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.

•

Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.

•

Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.

•

Delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.

•

Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.

•

Investing in land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.

•

Continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts by assisting Forestar with its operations and expanding our relationships with land developers across the country.

•

Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.

•

Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.

•

Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.

•

Opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns.

•

Ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.

•

Investing in the construction of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.

We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions.

Results of Operations — Homebuilding

Our operating segments are our 53 homebuilding divisions, our majority-owned Forestar lot development operations, our financial services operations and our other business activities. The homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six reporting segments. These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states:

The following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. For similar operating and financial data and discussion of our fiscal 2019 results compared to our fiscal 2018 results, refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, which was filed with the SEC on November 25, 2019.

_____________

(1)

Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.

_____________

(1)

Cancellation rate represents the number of cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders.



Net Sales Orders

The number of net sales orders increased 39% during 2020 compared to 2019, with significant increases in all of our regions. The value of net sales orders increased 40% to $23.6 billion (78,458 homes) in 2020 from $16.8 billion (56,565 homes) in 2019. The average selling price of net sales orders during fiscal 2020 was $300,900, up 1% from the prior year.

The markets contributing most to the increases in sales volumes in our regions were as follows: the Carolina markets (particularly Myrtle Beach and Charlotte) in the East; the Denver, Minneapolis and Indiana markets in the Midwest; the Florida markets (particularly Tampa) in the Southeast; the Houston and Dallas markets in the South Central; the Phoenix market in the Southwest; and the California and Nevada markets in the West.

Our sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 20% in 2020 compared to 21% in 2019.

The increase in our sales orders reflects the increase in demand for our homes in the second half of the year fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from mid-March through early April, which caused some pent-up demand.

Sales Order Backlog

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations.



Home Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales increased 16% to $19.6 billion (65,388 homes closed) in 2020 from $16.9 billion (56,975 homes closed) in 2019. Home sales revenues increased in all of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed.

The number of homes closed in fiscal 2020 increased 15% from 2019. The markets contributing most to the increase in closing volumes in our regions were as follows: the New Jersey, Myrtle Beach and Charlotte markets in the East; the Denver and Indianapolis markets in the Midwest; the Florida markets (particularly Tampa) in the Southeast; the Houston, Dallas and San Antonio markets in the South Central; the Tucson market in the Southwest; and the Portland and Southern California markets in the West.

Homebuilding Operating Margin Analysis

Home Sales Gross Profit

Gross profit from home sales increased to $4.3 billion in 2020 from $3.4 billion in 2019 and increased 160 basis points to 21.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 150 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price increased slightly, 20 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 20 basis points.

We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. These actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods. If a prolonged economic recession and a resulting decline in new home demand occur due to C-19 or otherwise, we would expect our gross profit margins to decline from current levels.

Land/Lot Sales and Other Revenues

Land/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $83.1 million and $91.9 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of September 30, 2020, our homebuilding operations had $28.3 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.



Inventory and Land Option Charges

At the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As of September 30, 2020, we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of $36.1 million and determined that no communities were impaired. Homebuilding impairment charges during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were $1.7 million and $24.9 million, respectively.

As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to C-19 or otherwise, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges that could be significant.

During fiscal 2020 and 2019, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $21.2 million and $28.3 million, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 8% to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019. SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.2% and 8.7% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Employee compensation and related costs represented 75% of SG&A costs in fiscal 2020 compared to 72% in fiscal 2019. These costs increased 13% to $1.2 billion in 2020 from $1.1 billion in 2019. Our homebuilding operations employed 7,281 and 6,810 employees at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.

Interest Incurred

We capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased 11% to $93.0 million in fiscal 2020 from $104.7 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was due to lower average interest rates on our homebuilding debt, as well as a 2% decrease in our average homebuilding debt in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.8% and 0.9% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Other Income

Other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $11.7 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $9.5 million in fiscal 2019. Other income consists of interest income, rental income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.

Business Acquisition

In October 2020, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes for approximately $23 million in cash. Braselton Homes operates in Corpus Christi, Texas. The assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory, 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes.



Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region

_____________

(1)

Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

The region generated pre-tax income of $443.3 million in 2020 compared to $378.0 million in 2019. Home sales gross profit percentage decreased by 10 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the average selling price of homes closed decreasing by more than the average cost of those homes. The region also benefited from lower inventory and land option charges, which were $4.3 million in 2020 compared to $24.2 million in 2019. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expenses decreased by 60 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the increase in homebuilding revenues.



Homebuilding Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory

We routinely enter into contracts to purchase land or developed residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. At the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.

Our homebuilding segment’s inventories at September 30, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:

Results of Operations — Forestar

In October 2017, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar and at September 30, 2020, we owned 65% of its outstanding shares. Forestar is a publicly traded residential lot development company with operations in 49 markets across 21 states as of September 30, 2020. Forestar’s segment results are presented on their historical cost basis, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance. (See Note B for additional Forestar segment information and purchase accounting adjustments.)

Results of operations for the Forestar segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows.

At September 30, 2020, Forestar owned directly or controlled through land and lot purchase contracts approximately 60,500 residential lots, of which approximately 5,000 are fully developed. Approximately 30,400 of these lots are under contract to sell to D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement with D.R. Horton. Approximately 400 of these lots are under contract to sell to other builders.

Residential land and lot sales primarily consist of the sale of single-family lots to local, regional and national homebuilders. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, Forestar’s land and lot sales, including the portion sold to D.R. Horton and the revenues generated from those sales, were as follows.

SG&A expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019 includes charges of $5.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, related to the shared services agreement between Forestar and D.R. Horton whereby D.R. Horton provides Forestar with certain administrative, compliance, operational and procurement services.



Results of Operations — Financial Services

The following tables and related discussion set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Financial Services Operating Margin Analysis



Mortgage Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. In fiscal 2020, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 35% from the prior year, due to an increase in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing, as well a 15% increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. The percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing was 68% in fiscal 2020 compared to 58% in the prior year. The increase in this percentage was primarily due to the Company’s program to offer below market interest rates to D.R. Horton homebuyers, expanded coverage in certain markets and increased efficiencies resulting from technology advances.

Homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 97% and 98% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These percentages reflect DHI Mortgage’s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.

The number of loans sold increased 35% in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on September 30, 2020 were eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. During fiscal 2020, approximately 66% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae and 28% were sold to two other major financial entities. Changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.

Due to the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets beginning in late March 2020 caused by C-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, many financial entities began offering lower pricing and limiting their purchases of our mortgages and servicing rights. As a result of the rapid decline in servicing values at the end of March, we began retaining the servicing rights on a portion of our loan originations. Servicing values have since improved, and we expect to sell these rights to third parties.

Financial Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from our mortgage operations increased 34% to $476.7 million in fiscal 2020 from $355.5 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 36% increase in loan originations. During the fourth quarter, due to better clarity related to the CARES Act, pricing and execution in the secondary market improved from the previous nine months ended June 30, 2020, which caused revenues in the fourth quarter to increase at a higher rate than origination volume. Revenues from our title operations increased 26% to $108.2 million in fiscal 2020 from $86.2 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 28% increase in escrow closings.

General and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations increased 24% to $364.7 million in fiscal 2020 from $293.0 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions. Our financial services operations employed 2,163 and 1,924 employees at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 62.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to 66.3% in the prior year. Fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.

Other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.

As a result of the revenue increases from higher volumes of mortgage originations and escrow closings, which also allowed us to better leverage our G&A expenses, pre-tax income from our financial services operations increased 47% to $245.2 million in fiscal 2020 from $166.3 million in fiscal 2019.



Results of Operations — Other Businesses

The combined pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $55.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $55.5 million in fiscal 2019. Income generated by our other businesses can vary significantly based on the timing of sales of multi-family rental properties.

Through DHI Communities, a 100% owned subsidiary, we develop, construct and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. DHI Communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After DHI Communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, DHI Communities sold multi-family rental properties for a total of $128.5 million and $133.4 million, respectively, and recorded gains on sale totaling $59.4 million and $51.9 million. DHI Communities had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at September 30, 2020. These six projects represent 1,730 multi-family units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units.

Results of Operations — Consolidated

Income before Income Taxes

Pre-tax income was $3.0 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin. In fiscal 2020, our homebuilding, financial services and other businesses generated pre-tax income of $2.7 billion, $245.2 million and $55.1 million, respectively, compared to pre-tax income of $1.9 billion, $166.3 million and $55.5 million, respectively, in fiscal 2019.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense was $602.5 million and $506.7 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our effective tax rate was 20.2% and 23.8% in those years. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 includes a tax benefit of $93.4 million from the enactment of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (the Act). The Act retroactively reinstated the federal energy efficient homes tax credit that expired on December 31, 2017 to homes closed from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a tax benefit of $11.2 million related to the release of a valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rates for both years include an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

Our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $152.4 million at September 30, 2020 compared to $181.8 million at September 30, 2019. We have a valuation allowance of $7.5 million and $18.7 million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. The decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to our determination that we will have sufficient future taxable income in certain state tax jurisdictions to realize a portion of our state NOL carryforwards. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.

D.R. Horton has $15.8 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. Of the total amount, $5.4 million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining $10.4 million expires from fiscal years 2031 to 2040. Forestar has $1.7 million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.



Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in our financial statements. Our unrecognized tax benefits totaled $8.9 million at September 30, 2020 and were insignificant at September 30, 2019.

D.R. Horton is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for D.R. Horton’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2017 through 2020. D.R. Horton is not currently under audit for federal income tax, but is under audit by various states. We are not aware of any significant findings by the state taxing authorities.

Forestar is subject to federal income tax and state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for Forestar’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for tax years 2016 through 2020. Forestar is not currently under audit for federal or state income taxes.



Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions. We remain cautious as to the ongoing impact of C-19 on the U.S. economy and will adjust our strategy as appropriate should market conditions change due to the pandemic or otherwise.

In the current market, we are increasing our investments in homebuilding inventories and single-family and multi-family rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability, as well as considering opportunistic strategic investments as they arise. We are also maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.

At September 30, 2020, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus notes payable) was 26.6% compared to 25.3% at September 30, 2019. Our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 17.5% compared to 17.0% at September 30, 2019. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35% throughout fiscal 2021. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of Forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.

We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities. At September 30, 2020, $394.3 million remained available under Forestar’s shelf registration statement, $100 million of which is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations, including the maturity of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our homebuilding senior notes in fiscal 2021. However, due to the current economic uncertainties related to C-19, we may be limited in accessing the capital markets or obtaining additional bank financing or the cost of accessing this financing could become more expensive for funding our longer-term capital needs.

Capital Resources - Homebuilding

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At September 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $2.6 billion.

Bank Credit Facilities

— We have a $1.59 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is October 2, 2024. Borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled $1.06 billion each during fiscal 2020. At September 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $142.9 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of approximately $1.45 billion.



In May 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $375 million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $550 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The interest rate on borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is May 27, 2021. There were no borrowings under the facility for the period from its inception through September 30, 2020.

Our homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facilities.

Public Unsecured Debt

— We have $2.45 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2020 that mature from December 2020 through October 2025. In October 2019, we issued $500 million principal amount of 2.5% senior notes due October 15, 2024, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 2.7%. In February 2020, we repaid $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity. In May 2020, we issued $500 million principal amount of 2.6% senior notes due October 15, 2025 with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 2.8%. The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.

In October 2020, we issued $500 million principal amount of 1.4% senior notes due October 15, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 1.6%.

— During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 7.0 million shares of our common stock for $360.4 million.

Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations

— Effective July 30, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $1.0 billion of our common stock. At September 30, 2020, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $535.3 million of the equity repurchase authorization was remaining. These authorizations have no expiration date.

Capital Resources - Forestar

Forestar’s ability to achieve its long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing in sufficient capacities. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At September 30, 2020, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $394.3 million.

Bank Credit Facility

— Forestar has a $380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $570 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on Forestar’s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $36.0 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $344.0 million. The maturity date of the facility is October 2, 2022, which can be extended by up to one year on up to two additional occasions, subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments.



The Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.

Unsecured Debt

— In February 2020, Forestar issued $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes mature March 1, 2028, with interest payable semi-annually, and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 5.2%. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture agreement. Forestar also has $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes that mature April 15, 2024. In March 2020, Forestar repaid $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity.

Forestar’s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. At September 30, 2020, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.

Debt Repurchase Authorization

— Effective April 30, 2020, Forestar’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of Forestar’s debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $30 million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2020.

Capital Resources - Financial Services

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At September 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services operations totaled $55.6 million.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility

— Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. The total capacity of the facility is $1.35 billion; however, the capacity increased, without requiring additional commitments, to $1.575 billion for approximately 45 days around September 30, 2020 and increases again for approximately 30 days around December 31, 2020. The capacity of the facility can also be increased to $1.8 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. The maturity date of the facility is February 19, 2021.

As of September 30, 2020, $1.42 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $1.39 billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $255.8 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.13 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2020 at a 2.4% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At September 30, 2020, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.



Operating Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion compared to $892.1 million in fiscal 2019. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year primarily consisted of $1.9 billion of cash provided by our homebuilding segment, partially offset by $292.8 million and $168.5 million of cash used in our financial services and Forestar segments, respectively.

Cash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory was $739.1 million in fiscal 2020 as our homes in inventory increased by approximately 10,300 homes at September 30, 2020 compared to September 30, 2019. Cash provided from a decrease in construction in progress and finished home inventory was $84.6 million in fiscal 2019 as our homes in inventory at September 30, 2019 remained relatively flat compared to September 30, 2018. Cash used to increase residential land and lots was $324.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $676.4 million in fiscal 2019. Of these amounts, $281.5 million and $513.2 million, respectively, related to Forestar. The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both years was net income.

Investing Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $166.1 million compared to $394.0 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental properties totaling $190.3 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $96.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets primarily consisting of $128.5 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties. In fiscal 2019, the most significant uses of cash were the purchases of the homebuilding operations of Westport Homes, Classic Builders and Terramor Homes. Proceeds from the sale of assets in fiscal 2019 included $133.4 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties.

Financing Cash Flow Activities

We expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our homebuilding and Forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.

In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $270.6 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds of $1.1 billion from draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.5% homebuilding senior notes, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.6% homebuilding senior notes, Forestar’s issuance of $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes and net advances of $243.7 million on our mortgage repurchase facility. Note proceeds were partially offset by repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $1.1 billion, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, Forestar’s repayment of $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase 7.0 million shares of our common stock for $360.4 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $256.0 million.

In fiscal 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $490.1 million, consisting primarily of repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding and Forestar revolving credit facilities totaling $2.2 billion, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 3.75% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase 11.9 million shares of our common stock for $479.8 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $223.4 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds of $2.2 billion from draws on our homebuilding and Forestar revolving credit facilities, Forestar’s issuance of $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes, net advances of $251.2 million on our mortgage repurchase facility and proceeds of $100.7 million from Forestar’s issuance of common stock.

Our Board of Directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.175 per common share in fiscal 2020 and $0.15 per common share in fiscal 2019. In November 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on December 14, 2020, to stockholders of record on December 4, 2020. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.



Contractual Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.

Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2020 are presented below.

_______________

(1)

Notes payable represents principal and interest payments due on our senior notes, our secured notes, our mortgage subsidiary’s repurchase facility and our homebuilding and Forestar revolving credit facilities. Because the balances of our revolving credit facilities were zero at September 30, 2020, we did not assume any principal or interest payments related to these facilities in future periods. The interest obligation associated with our mortgage repurchase facility is based on its annual effective rate of 2.4% and principal balance outstanding at September 30, 2020.

(2)

Purchase obligations relate to a limited number of land and lot purchase contracts with $32.6 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance provisions that may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of this amount, $1.4 million related to contracts between our homebuilding segment and Forestar. Further information about our land purchase contracts is provided in the “Homebuilding Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory” section included herein.

At September 30, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit of $178.9 million and surety bonds of $1.8 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” under Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K.



Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information

As of September 30, 2020, D.R. Horton, Inc. had outstanding $2.45 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes due through October 2025 and

no

amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facilities.

All of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the Forestar lot development operation, financial services operations, multi-family residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facilities (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.

The guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.

The following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.



A court could void or subordinate any Guarantor’s guarantee under the fraudulent conveyance laws if existing or future creditors of any such Guarantor were successful in establishing that:

•

such guarantee was incurred with fraudulent intent; or

•

such Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for issuing its guarantee; and

•

was insolvent at the time of the guarantee;

•

was rendered insolvent by reason of the guarantee;

•

was engaged in a business or transaction for which its assets constituted unreasonably small capital to carry on its business; or

•

intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debt beyond its ability to pay such debt as it matured.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of determining whether a fraudulent conveyance occurred would vary depending upon the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and upon the valuation assumptions and methodology applied by the court. Generally, however, a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if:

•

the sum of the company’s debts, including contingent, unliquidated and unmatured liabilities, is greater than all of such company’s property at a fair valuation; or

•

the present fair saleable value of the company’s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.

The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantor’s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.

On the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the Guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.

Seasonality

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

Inflation

We may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher financing, land, labor and material construction costs. We attempt to offset cost increases in one component with savings in another, and we increase our sales prices and reduce customer sales incentives when housing market conditions permit. However, during periods when housing market conditions are challenging, we may not be able to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates reduce the affordability of our homes to prospective homebuyers.

Critical Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. Our performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We rarely purchase land for resale, but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into our strategic operating plans. Revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. Revenues associated with our mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. We typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. We sell substantially all of the mortgages we originate and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.

Mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. Based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage purchasers, analysis of the volume of mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests.

We collect insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers through our 100% owned insurance agency. We recognize revenue and a contract asset for estimated future renewals of these policies upon issuance of the initial policy, the date at which the performance obligation is satisfied.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.



Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.

When a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.

At the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. We generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type or future plans. In reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of our communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;

•

alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;

•

amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.



For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

We rarely purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans, and we determine that we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

The key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions, and are inherently uncertain. Although our quarterly assessments reflect management’s best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.

Warranty Claims

— We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. Our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual.

Legal Claims and Insurance

— We are named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, we are managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. We have established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. Approximately 99% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had reserves for approximately 260 and 180 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During fiscal 2020, we established reserves for approximately 175 new construction defect claims and resolved 95 construction defect claims for a total cost of $25.8 million. We have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.



Historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate. We also believe that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from our home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.

We estimate and record receivables under the applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. Additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.

The estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. A 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $78.7 million in our reserves and a $40.2 million increase in our receivable, resulting in additional expense of $38.5 million. A 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $71.1 million in our reserves and a $33.3 million decrease in our receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $37.8 million.

Pending Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test and requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. Under the new guidance, goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes. The guidance is effective for us beginning October 1, 2021, although early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform,” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of MBS, which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific purchaser through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third-party purchasers. The hedging instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as derivative instruments in an economic hedge, with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Hedging instruments related to funded, uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair value, with changes recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, along with changes in the fair value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans. The net fair value change, which for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2020, hedging instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled a notional amount of $2.8 billion. Uncommitted IRLCs totaled a notional amount of approximately $1.7 billion and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled a notional amount of approximately $1.2 billion at September 30, 2020.

We occasionally enter into forward sales of MBS as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to our homebuyers in certain markets. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had MBS totaling $1.1 billion and $111.4 million, respectively, that did not yet have IRLCs or closed loans created or assigned and recorded a liability of $5.3 million and $0.5 million for the fair value of such MBS position.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, effective weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2020. Because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale that are typically sold within 60 days, its outstanding balance is included in the most current period presented. The interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A –

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its 100% owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, which are collectively referred to as the Company, unless the context otherwise requires. Noncontrolling interests represent the proportionate equity interests in consolidated entities that are not 100% owned by the Company. The Company owns a


% controlling interest in Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar) and therefore is required to consolidate 100% of Forestar within its consolidated financial statements, and the


% interest the Company does not own is accounted for as noncontrolling interests. All intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. At the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company reclassified its single-family rental properties from other assets to property and equipment in its homebuilding segment. Reclassification of the prior period amount resulted in a $

37.0

million decrease in other assets with a corresponding increase in property and equipment at September 30, 2019. This reclassification had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, “Leases,” which requires that lease assets and liabilities be recognized on the balance sheet and that key information about leasing arrangements be disclosed. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2019 and did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As a result of the adoption of this standard on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded right of use assets of $

39.0

million and lease liabilities of $

40.3

million. Lease right of use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

In March 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements applicable to registered debt offerings that include credit enhancements, such as subsidiary guarantees, in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. The amended rule focuses on providing material, relevant and decision-useful information regarding guarantees and other credit enhancements, while eliminating certain prescriptive requirements. The Company adopted these amendments on March 31, 2020. Accordingly, summarized financial information has been presented only for the issuers and guarantors of the Company's registered securities for the most recent fiscal year and as permitted, this information is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-09, “Debt (Topic 470) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762,” to reflect the SEC’s new disclosure rules on guaranteed debt securities offerings adopted by the Company in March 2020.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. The Company’s performance obligation, to deliver the agreed-upon home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date. Proceeds from home closings held for the Company’s benefit at title companies are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

When the Company executes sales contracts with its homebuyers, or when it requires advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are cancelled. The Company either retains or refunds to the homebuyer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

The Company rarely purchases land for resale, but periodically may elect to sell parcels of land that no longer fit into its strategic operating plans. Revenue from land sales is typically recognized on the closing date, which is generally when performance obligations are satisfied.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. Revenues associated with the Company’s mortgage operations primarily include net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and servicing rights. The Company typically elects the fair value option for its mortgage loan originations whereby mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and loan values are adjusted through revenues for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. Expected gains and losses from the sale of servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through revenues at the time of commitment. The Company sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.

The Company collects insurance commissions on homeowner policies placed with third party carriers through its 100% owned insurance agency. The Company recognizes revenue and a contract asset for estimated future renewals of these policies upon issuance of the initial policy, the date at which the performance obligation is satisfied.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Proceeds from home closings held for the Company’s benefit at title companies, which totaled $

237.6

million and $

244.8

million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in homebuilding cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash balances of the Company’s captive insurance subsidiary, which are expected to be used to fund the subsidiary’s operations and pay future anticipated legal claims, were $

51.3

million and $

48.6

million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.

Restricted Cash

The Company has cash that is restricted as to its use. Restricted cash related to homebuilding and land development operations includes customer deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance with regulatory requirements. Restricted cash related to financial services is mortgagor related funds held by the Company for taxes and insurance on an interim basis until the loans are sold.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Costs incurred after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are specifically identified and recorded to individual homes. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Cost of sales for lots sold includes all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot in the community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home or lot closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes or lots in the community associated with the relevant development activity.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. A liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales are recorded for the amount estimated to ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. Home construction budgets are compared to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home.

The Company rarely purchases land for resale. However, when the Company owns land or communities under development that do not fit into its development and construction plans, and the Company determines that it will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale if certain criteria are met. The Company records land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell.

At the end of each quarter, the Company reviews the performance and outlook for all of its communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, the Company performs an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes. The key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market and economic conditions and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. See Note C.

Capitalized Interest

The Company capitalizes interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. During periods in which the Company’s active inventory is lower than its debt level, a portion of the interest incurred is reflected as interest expense in the period incurred. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s active inventory exceeded its debt level, and all interest incurred was capitalized to inventory. See Note E.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Land Purchase Contract Deposits and Pre-Acquisition Costs

The Company enters into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of many of the purchase contracts, the deposits are not refundable in the event the Company elects to terminate the contract. Land purchase contract deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are expensed to inventory and land option charges when the Company believes it is probable that it will not acquire the property under contract and will not be able to recover these costs through other means. See Notes C and L.

Variable Interests

Land purchase contracts can result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under contract. There were no variable interest entities reported in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2020 because, with regard to each entity, the Company determined it did not control the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance. At September 30, 2019, there was one variable interest entity reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as a result of the related party transaction described in Note O.

The maximum exposure to losses related to the Company’s unconsolidated variable interest entities is limited to the amounts of the Company’s related deposits. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the deposits related to these contracts totaled $

519.6

million and $

396.9

million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property under construction is not depreciated until the property is placed in service. Depreciation generally is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The depreciable life of model home furniture is


years, depreciable lives of other furniture and equipment typically range from


to


years, and depreciable lives of buildings and improvements typically range from


to


years. The depreciable lives of single-family rental homes and multi-family rental buildings typically range from


to


years. See Note F.

Business Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and the Company’s estimates of significant assumptions that a market participant would use when determining fair value. While the Company believes the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill

The Company records goodwill associated with its acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill balances are evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis by performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that additional impairment testing is required, then a quantitative assessment is performed to determine the operating segment’s fair value. The estimated fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of the operating segment to present value. If the carrying value of the operating segment exceeds its fair value, the Company determines if an impairment exists based on the implied fair value of the operating segment’s goodwill. As a result of the qualitative assessments performed in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018,

no

impairment charges were indicated or recorded.

The Company’s goodwill balances by reporting segment were as follows:

Warranty Claims

The Company typically provides its homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. Since the Company subcontracts its construction work to subcontractors who typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic areas in which they are built. See Note L.

Legal Claims and Insurance

The Company records expenses and liabilities for legal claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The amounts recorded for these contingencies are based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The Company estimates and records receivables under its applicable insurance policies for these legal claims when recovery is probable. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. See Note L.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $

41.7

million, $

47.0

million and $

44.1

million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company’s income tax expense is calculated using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company records a valuation allowance when it determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note H.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in increases or decreases in the Company’s income tax expense in the period in which the change is made. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits totaled $

8.9

million at September 30, 2020 and were insignificant at September 30, 2019.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities outstanding during each year. See Note I.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stockholders formally authorize shares of its common stock to be available for future grants of stock-based compensation awards. From time to time, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to its employees and directors from these available shares. At September 30, 2020, the outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units. Grants of restricted stock units vest over a certain number of years as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Restricted stock units outstanding at September 30, 2020 have a remaining vesting period up to

4.4

years. Stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. All stock options outstanding at September 30, 2020 have vested and expire


years after the dates on which they were granted.

The compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of restricted stock units are based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant. The fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of estimates. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. See Note K.

Fair Value Measurements

The FASB’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. The Company considers the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with the Company’s counterparties when determining the fair value measurements, if applicable. Fair value measurements are used for the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by residential real estate, mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories, other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value is not recoverable. See Note N.

Pending Accounting Standards

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,” which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test that requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. Under the new guidance, goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2021, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform,” which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s operating segments are its


homebuilding divisions, its majority-owned Forestar residential lot development operations, its financial services operations and its other business activities. The Company’s reporting segments are its homebuilding reporting segments, its Forestar lot development segment and its financial services segment. The homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into the following

six

reporting segments: East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have homebuilding operations located in the following states:

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating


% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company’s homebuilding divisions are primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land and the construction and sale of residential homes, with operations in


markets across


states. Most of the revenue generated by the Company’s homebuilding operations is from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots.

The Forestar segment is a residential lot development company with operations in


markets across


states. Forestar has made significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its business across the United States. The homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Forestar’s segment results are presented on their historical cost basis, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of the Company’s homebuilding markets. The segment generates the substantial majority of its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services. The Company sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers.

In addition to its homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, the Company has subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other. One of these subsidiaries, DHI Communities, constructs multi-family rental properties and had

five

projects under active construction and

one

project that was substantially complete at September 30, 2020. These six projects represent

1,730

multi-family units, including

1,430

units under active construction and


completed units. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, DHI Communities sold two properties each year representing


and


multi-family rental units, respectively, for $

128.5

million and $

133.4

million, and recorded gains on sale totaling $

59.4

million and $

51.9

million. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the consolidated balance sheets included $

246.2

million and $

204.0

million, respectively, of assets related to DHI Communities.

Homebuilding:

The Company has a $

1.59

billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $

2.5

billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to


% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is October 2, 2024. Borrowings and repayments under the facility totaled $

1.06

billion each during fiscal 2020. At September 30, 2020, there were

no

borrowings outstanding and $

142.9

million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of approximately $

1.45

billion.

In May 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement providing for a $


million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $


million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The interest rate on borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is May 27, 2021. There were no borrowings under the facility for the period from its inception through September 30, 2020.

The Company’s homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on its operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if the leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities and the indentures governing the senior notes also impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its homebuilding revolving credit facilities and public debt obligations.

D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that the Company may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined.

In October 2019, the Company issued $


million principal amount of

2.5

% senior notes due

October 15, 2024

, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is

The key terms of the Company’s homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of September 30, 2020 are summarized below.

_____________

(1)

The Company may redeem the notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of


% of their principal amount or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted to the redemption date, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the

4.375

% senior notes,

4.75

% senior notes and

5.75

% senior notes are redeemable at a redemption price of


% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on or after the date that is three months prior to the final maturity date of the notes, and the

2.5

% senior notes and

2.6

% senior notes are redeemable at a redemption price of


% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on or after the date that is one month prior to the final maturity date of the notes.

(2)

Interest is payable semi-annually on each of the series of senior notes. The annual effective interest rate is calculated after giving effect to the amortization of debt issuance costs.

All series of homebuilding senior notes and borrowings under the homebuilding revolving credit facility are senior obligations and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and senior to all existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated to them. The homebuilding senior notes and borrowings under the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by entities that hold approximately


% of the Company’s assets. Upon the occurrence of both a change of control of the Company and a ratings downgrade event, as defined in the indentures governing its senior notes, the Company would be required in certain circumstances to offer to repurchase these notes at


% of their principal amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest. Also, a change of control as defined in the revolving credit facility would constitute an event of default under the revolving credit facilities, which could result in the acceleration of any borrowings outstanding under the facilities and the termination of the commitments thereunder.

Effective July 30, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $


million of the Company’s debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $


million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2020.

Forestar:

Forestar has a $


million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $


million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $


million and


% of the revolving credit commitment. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on Forestar’s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At September 30, 2020, there were

no

borrowings outstanding and $

36.0

million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $

344.0

million. The maturity date of the facility is October 2, 2022, which can be extended by up to one year on up to two additional occasions, subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.

In February 2020, Forestar issued $


million principal amount of

5.0

% senior notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes mature

March 1, 2028

, with interest payable semi-annually, and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is

5.2

%. Forestar also has $


million principal amount of

8.0

% senior notes that mature

April 15, 2024

. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture agreements. In March 2020, Forestar repaid $

118.9

million principal amount of its

3.75

% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity.

Forestar’s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s homebuilding debt. At September 30, 2020, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.

Effective April 30, 2020, Forestar’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $


million of Forestar’s debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $


million authorization was remaining at September 30, 2020.

Financial Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. The total capacity of the facility is $

1.35

billion; however, the capacity increased, without requiring additional commitments, to $

1.575

billion for approximately 45 days around September 30, 2020 and increases again for approximately 30 days around December 31, 2020. The capacity of the facility can also be increased to $

1.8

billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. The maturity date of the facility is February 19, 2021.

As of September 30, 2020, $

1.42

billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $

1.39

billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $

255.8

million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $

1.13

billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2020 at a

2.4

% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At September 30, 2020, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

MORTGAGE LOANS

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Related Derivatives

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property. At September 30, 2020, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate carrying value of $

1.53

billion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $

1.46

billion. At September 30, 2019, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate carrying value of $

1.07

billion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $

1.04

billion. During the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, mortgage loans originated totaled $

12.2

billion, $

8.7

billion and $

7.6

billion, respectively, and mortgage loans sold totaled $

11.8

billion, $

8.4

billion and $

7.4

billion, respectively. The Company had gains on sales of loans and servicing rights of $

437.2

million, $

319.4

million and $

265.1

million during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net gains on sales of loans and servicing rights are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2020, approximately


% of the Company’s mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae and


% were sold to two other major financial entities.

In response to C-19, the U.S. government has taken various actions to support the economy and the continued functioning of the financial markets. On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which included changes to current forbearance options for government-backed loans designed to keep homeowners in their homes. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these forbearance options, servicing values declined rapidly at the end of March. As a result, the Company began retaining the servicing rights on a portion of its loan originations. Servicing values have since improved, and the Company expects to sell these rights to third parties. At September 30, 2020, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $

17.1

million and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage operations, the Company hedges its risk using derivative instruments, generally forward sales of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are referred to as “hedging instruments” in the following discussion. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Newly originated loans that have been closed but not committed to third-party purchasers are hedged to mitigate the risk of changes in their fair value. Hedged loans are committed to third-party purchasers typically within three days after origination. The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge mortgage loans held for sale may vary in relationship to the underlying loan amounts, depending on the movements in the value of each hedging instrument relative to the value of the underlying mortgage loans. The fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in the mortgage loans held for sale. The net fair value change, which for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was not significant, is recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale that were not committed to third-party purchasers totaled $

1.2

billion and $

663.8

million, respectively.

The Company also uses hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to its homebuyers. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had MBS totaling $

1.1

billion and $

111.4

million, respectively, that did not yet have interest rate lock commitments or closed loans created or assigned and recorded a liability of $

5.3

million and $

0.5

million for the fair value of such MBS position.

Loan Commitments and Related Derivatives

The Company is party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs), which are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of IRLCs, which are accounted for as derivative instruments recorded at fair value, totaled $

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments and hedging instruments. These instruments are considered derivatives in an economic hedge and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments totaled $

84.6

million and $

25.2

million, respectively, and the notional amount of hedging instruments related to IRLCs not yet committed to purchasers totaled $

1.6

billion and $

Other Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves

Mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions derived from industry-standard representations and warranties in the relevant agreements. These representations and warranties primarily involve the absence of misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties, the appropriate underwriting of the loan and in some cases, a required minimum number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company generally does not retain any other continuing interest related to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. The majority of other mortgage loans consists of loans repurchased due to these limited recourse obligations. Typically, these loans are impaired, and some result in real estate owned through the foreclosure process. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s total other mortgage loans and real estate owned, before loss reserves, totaled $

14.9

million and $

11.4

million, respectively.

The Company has recorded reserves for estimated losses on other mortgage loans, real estate owned and future loan repurchase obligations due to the limited recourse provisions, all of which are recorded as reductions of revenue. The loss reserve for loan repurchase and settlement obligations is estimated based on analysis of the volume of mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with mortgage purchasers. The reserve balances at September 30, 2020 and 2019 totaled $

8.9

million and $

8.7

million, respectively.

Other mortgage loans and real estate owned net of the related loss reserves are included in other assets, while loan repurchase obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Expense

The components of the Company’s income tax expense are as follows:



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company’s effective tax rate was

20.2

%,

23.8

% and

29.0

% in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 includes a tax benefit of $

93.4

million from the enactment of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (the Act). The Act retroactively reinstated the federal energy efficient homes tax credit that expired on December 31, 2017 to homes closed from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 also includes a tax benefit of $

11.2

million related to the release of a valuation allowance against the Company’s state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rates for all years include an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 included the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which, among other items, reduced the federal corporate tax rate from


% to


% and repealed the domestic production activities deduction effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2018. For fiscal year companies, the change in law required an application of a blended tax rate in the year of change, which for the Company was

24.5

% for fiscal 2018. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 also included a tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit to homes closed through December 31, 2017 and the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to Forestar.

Reconciliation of Expected Income Tax Expense

Differences between income tax expense and tax computed by applying the federal statutory rate of


% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, and

24.5

% in fiscal 2018 to income before income taxes during each year is due to the following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement bases of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, tax losses and credit carryforwards.

Components of deferred income taxes are summarized as follows:

D.R. Horton has $

15.8

million of tax benefits for state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction. Of the total amount, $

5.4

million of the tax benefits expire over the next ten years and the remaining $

10.4

million expires from fiscal years 2031 to 2040. Forestar has $

1.7

million of tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards that expire at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets.

Valuation Allowance

The Company has a valuation allowance of $

7.5

million and $

18.7

million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. The decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the Company’s determination that it will have sufficient future taxable income in certain state tax jurisdictions to realize a portion of the state NOL carryforwards. The Company will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to the remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized in the financial statements.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2020 is as follows.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is $

8.9

million. The Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2020. The Company classifies interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense.

NOTE L –

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Warranty Claims

The Company provides its homebuyers with warranties for defects in structural elements, mechanical systems and other construction components of the home. Warranty liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered based on management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs and by accruing for existing warranty claims. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic areas in which they are built. The estimation of these costs is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties related to these factors. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing the liability for warranty claims, actual future costs could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its warranty liability.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

The change in liabilities for pre-existing warranties was $

25.5

million and $

32.0

million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts reflect the Company’s ongoing efforts to improve its customer service and relations, which in many cases results in the performance of warranty service after the original warranty period has expired. The Company has increased the amount of its warranties issued as a percentage of home cost of sales to reflect this increase in warranty costs.

Legal Claims and Insurance

The Company is named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, the Company is managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The Company has established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The estimated liabilities for these contingencies were $

473.8

million and $

434.7

million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Approximately


% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both September 30, 2020 and 2019. Expenses related to the Company’s legal contingencies were $

64.4

million, $

15.3

million and $

41.0

million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Company’s reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. As of September 30, 2020, no individual existing claim was material to the Company’s financial statements. The Company has closed a significant number of homes during recent years and may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. Although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which the Company operates. Historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where the Company operates are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. These estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and the Company believes they may continue to fluctuate. The Company also believes that fluctuations in housing market conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. If the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from the Company’s home closings in prior years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change the Company’s estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. If the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed the Company’s current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on its future earnings and liquidity.

Changes in the Company’s legal claims reserves during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

In the majority of states in which it operates, the Company has, and requires the majority of the subcontractors it uses to have, general liability insurance which includes construction defect coverage. The Company’s general liability insurance policies protect it against a portion of its risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and lawsuits. The Company estimates and records receivables under these policies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. However, because the self-insured retentions under these policies are significant, the Company anticipates it will largely be self-insured. The Company’s estimated insurance receivables from estimated losses for pending legal claims and anticipated future claims relate to previously closed homes over the last 15 years. These receivables totaled $

81.2

million and $

75.1

million at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.

In some states where the Company believes it is too difficult or expensive for its subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, the Company has waived its normal subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs from subcontractors. In these states, the Company purchases insurance policies from either third-party carriers or its 100% owned captive insurance subsidiary and names certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The policies issued by the captive insurance subsidiary represent self-insurance of these risks by the Company.

The Company is self-insured for the deductible amounts under its workers’ compensation insurance policies. The deductibles vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $

0.5

million per occurrence. The deductible for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 policy years is $

0.5

million per occurrence.

The estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the Company’s markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its reserves.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value measurements are used for the Company’s mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by residential real estate, mortgage servicing rights, IRLCs and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis and are used for inventories, other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value is not recoverable. The fair value hierarchy and its application to the Company’s assets and liabilities is as follows:

•

Level 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company does not currently have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs.

•

Level 2 – Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market. The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a recurring basis are as follows:

◦

Mortgage loans held for sale

- The fair value of these loans is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. Closed mortgage loans are typically sold shortly after origination, which limits exposure to nonperformance by loan buyer counterparties to a short time period. In addition, the Company actively monitors the financial strength of its counterparties.

◦

IRLCs

- The fair value of IRLCs is calculated by reference to quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with similar characteristics. These valuations do not contain adjustments for expirations as any expired commitments are excluded from the fair value measurement. The Company generally only issues IRLCs for products that meet specific purchaser guidelines. Should any purchaser become insolvent, the Company would not be required to close the transaction based on the terms of the commitment. Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, the Company adjusts its fair value measurements for the estimated amount of IRLCs that will not close.

◦

Loan sale commitments and hedging instruments

- The fair values of best-efforts and mandatory loan sale commitments and derivative instruments such as forward sales of MBS that are utilized as hedging instruments are calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets. The Company mitigates exposure to nonperformance risk associated with derivative instruments by limiting the number of counterparties and actively monitoring their financial strength and creditworthiness. Further, the Company’s derivative contracts typically have short-term durations with maturities from one to four months. Accordingly, the Company’s risk of nonperformance relative to its derivative positions is not significant.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs on a nonrecurring basis are a limited number of mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value. When available, fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in the secondary markets for such assets.

After consideration of nonperformance risk, no additional adjustments were made to the fair value measurements of mortgage loans held for sale, IRLCs or hedging instruments.



D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Level 3 – Valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs on a recurring basis are its debt securities collateralized by residential real estate, mortgage servicing rights and a limited number of mortgage loans held for sale with some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and for which reference to quoted prices in the secondary markets is not available.

The Company’s assets measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs that are typically reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis are as follows:

Inventory held and used

- In determining the fair values of its inventory held and used in its impairment evaluations, the Company performs an analysis of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets. The most significant factors used to estimate undiscounted future cash flows include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by the community, the rate at which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes. Inventory held and used measured at fair value represents those communities for which the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amounts and therefore, the Company recorded impairments during the period to record the inventory at fair value calculated based on its discounted estimated future cash flows.

◦

Inventory available for sale

- The factors considered in determining fair values of the Company’s land held for sale primarily include actual sale contracts and recent offers received from outside third parties, and may also include prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and other market analysis. If the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the asset’s current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

◦

Certain mortgage loans held for sale

- A limited number of mortgage loans held for sale have some degree of impairment affecting their marketability. For some of these loans, quoted prices in the secondary market are not available and therefore, a cash flow valuation model is used to determine fair value.

◦

Certain other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned

- Other mortgage loans include performing and nonperforming mortgage loans, which often become real estate owned through the foreclosure process. The fair values of other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned are determined based on the Company’s assessment of the value of the underlying collateral or the value of the property, as applicable. The Company uses different methods to assess the value of the properties, which may include broker price opinions, appraisals or cash flow valuation models.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 assets during fiscal 2020 and 2019.

___________________________________________

(1)

The Company typically elects the fair value option upon origination for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for sale is based on contractual interest rates and included in other income. Mortgage loans held for sale valued using Level 3 inputs at September 30, 2020 and 2019 include $

15.1

million and $

9.8

million, respectively, of loans for which the Company elected the fair value option upon origination and did not sell into the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale totaling $

7.7

million and $

6.5

million were transferred to Level 3 during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of these loans. The fair value of these mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated considering pricing in the secondary market and adjusted for the value of the underlying collateral, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. The Company plans to sell these loans as market conditions permit.

(2)

Although the majority of the Company’s mortgage loans are sold on a servicing-released basis, when the servicing rights are retained, the Company records them at fair value using third-party valuations. The valuation at the time the servicing asset is retained is reflected in the purchases/originations column with subsequent changes in value classified as realized and unrealized gains (losses). The key assumptions used in the valuation, which are generally unobservable inputs, are mortgage prepayment rates, discount rates and delinquency rates, which were


%,


% and


%, respectively, at September 30, 2020.

(3)

Fair value measurements of these derivatives represent changes in fair value, as calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets, and are reflected in the balance sheet as other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The net fair value change in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was not significant.

% to


% were used in the periods presented.

(3)

These mortgage loans have some degree of impairment affecting their marketability and are valued at the lower of carrying value or fair value. When available, quoted prices in the secondary market are used to determine fair value (Level 2); otherwise, a cash flow valuation model is used to determine fair value (Level 3).

(4)

The fair values of other mortgage loans was determined based on the value of the underlying collateral

.

For the financial assets and liabilities that the Company does not reflect at fair value, the following tables present both their respective carrying value and fair value at September 30, 2020 and 2019.

______________

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In March 2019, the Company assigned its rights under a land purchase contract it entered into in December 2017 to R&R Riverview LLC (R&R), an entity owned by Ryan Horton and Reagan Horton, the adult sons of Donald R. Horton, the Company’s Chairman. In March 2019, R&R exercised its rights under the purchase contract and paid $

77.5

million for


acres of undeveloped land in Arizona. In connection with the transaction, Donald R. Horton loaned R&R $

77.5

million at a

2.55

% annual interest rate and obtained a security interest in the land. Concurrent with the contract assignment to R&R, the Company entered into a land purchase contract with R&R to purchase the


acres for R&R’s cost plus an annualized return of


%. In accordance with the Company’s policy on related party transactions, this transaction was reviewed and approved by a committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors.

The Company determined that R&R was a variable interest entity, and the Company had the power through its rights in its land purchase contract with R&R to control the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements by increasing inventory and notes payable by $

77.5

million, and this amount was included in those balances at September 30, 2019.

In October 2019, the Company paid R&R $

84.2

million for all


acres of land and deconsolidated the variable interest entity from the financial statements. The purchase transaction was also reviewed and approved by a committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2020.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, as stated in their report included herein.
