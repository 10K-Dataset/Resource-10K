2010 ANNUAL REPORT ON

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is one of the largest homebuilding companies
    in the United States. We construct and sell homes through our
    operating divisions in 26 states and 72 metropolitan
    markets of the United States, primarily under the name of D.R.
    Horton,

America’s Builder

. Our common stock is
    included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York
    Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless
    the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R.
    Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and
    “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In
    1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and
    businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential
    home construction and development companies owned or controlled
    by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public
    offering of our common stock. The growth of our company over the
    years was achieved by investing available capital into our
    existing homebuilding markets and into

start-up

operations in new markets. Additionally, we acquired other
    homebuilding companies, which strengthened our position in
    existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and
    product offerings in other markets. Our homes generally range in
    size from 1,000 to 4,000 square feet and in price from
    $90,000 to $700,000. The current downturn in our industry has
    resulted in a substantial decrease in the size of our operations
    during the last four fiscal years as we have reacted to the
    significantly weakened market for new homes. For the year ended
    September 30, 2010, we closed 20,875 homes with an average
    closing sales price of approximately $206,100.

Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage
    financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our
    homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    provides mortgage financing services principally to the
    purchasers of homes we build. We generally do not retain or
    service the mortgages we originate but, rather, seek to sell the
    mortgages and related servicing rights to third-party
    purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with
    purchaser guidelines and historically has sold substantially all
    of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination.
    Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents
    by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
    services, primarily to the purchasers of our homes.

Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding
    segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding
    operations are the most substantial part of our business,
    comprising approximately 98% of consolidated revenues, which
    totaled $4.4 billion in fiscal 2010. Our homebuilding
    operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of
    completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and
    lots. In addition to building traditional single-family detached
    homes, we also build attached homes, such as town homes,
    duplexes, triplexes and condominiums (including some mid-rise
    buildings), which share common walls and roofs. The sale of
    detached homes generated approximately 86%, 81%, and 77% of home
    sales revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our
    financial services segment generates its revenues from
    originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title
    insurance agency and closing services.

We make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our
    Internet website all of our reports required to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports
    include our annual report on

Form 10-K,

Operating
    Strategy and Structure

For a substantial part of our company’s existence, we
    maintained significant

year-over-year

growth and profitability. We achieved this growth through an
    operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share,
    while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. To execute our
    strategy, we invested available capital in our existing
    homebuilding markets and opportunistically entered new markets.
    We also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition
    opportunities as they arose, some of which resulted in
    acquisitions and contributed to our growth.

During the past four years, conditions in the homebuilding
    industry have been challenging. Although we believe the
    long-term fundamental factors that support housing demand remain
    positive, it is not possible to predict when current conditions
    will improve or if they will deteriorate from current levels.
    During the current downturn we have increased our cash balances
    by generating substantial cash flow from operations, primarily
    through reductions in inventory and mortgage loans held for
    sale, the receipt of tax refunds and by accessing the capital
    markets. While we will continue to conservatively manage our
    business, our increased liquidity provides us with flexibility
    in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of
    our communities and markets to strike the best balance between
    cash flow generation and potential profit.

Geographic
    Diversity

From 1978 to late 1987, our homebuilding activities were
    conducted in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We then began
    diversifying geographically by entering additional markets, both
    through

start-up

operations and acquisitions. We now operate in 26 states
    and 72 markets. This provides us with geographic diversification
    in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of
    revenues and earnings. We believe our diversification strategy
    helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic
    cycles and enhances our long-term potential.

Economies
    of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in
    terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2010. By the same
    measure, we are also one of the five largest builders in many of
    our markets in fiscal 2010. We believe that our national,
    regional and local scale of operations has provided us with
    benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some
    other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national,
    regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates
    from certain subcontractors;

•

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities,
    which allows us greater flexibility to compete for greater
    market share in each of our markets; and

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong
    balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships.

Decentralized
    Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating
    flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key
    operating decisions. At September 30, 2010, we had 33
    separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate
    in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division
    consists of a division president; land entitlement, acquisition
    and development personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel;
    a construction manager and construction superintendents;
    customer service personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager
    and office staff. We believe that division presidents and their
    management teams, who are familiar with local conditions,
    generally have better information on which to base decisions
    regarding their operations. Our division presidents receive
    performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and
    operational measures in their operating divisions.



Operating
    Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental
    requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work
    required to meet local building codes;

•

Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction
    approvals;

•

Overseeing land development;

•

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•

Selecting and managing construction subcontractors and suppliers;

•

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules;

•

Developing and implementing local marketing plans; and

•

Coordinating post closing customer service and warranty repairs.

Centralized
    Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business
    through our regional and corporate offices. We have four
    separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional
    office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief
    financial officer, a purchasing manager and limited office
    support staff. Each of our region presidents and their
    management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations
    of up to eleven homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division president
    compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are
    responsible for establishing our operational policies and
    internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with
    established policies and controls throughout our operations. The
    corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct
    management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through
    the following centralized functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to
    our operating divisions;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Accounting and management reporting;



•

Internal audit;

•

Information technology systems;

•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Management of major national or regional supply chain
    initiatives;

•

Monitoring and analysis of margins, returns and
    expenses; and

•

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of
    results.

Cost
    Management

We control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative
    and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of
    administrative personnel and management positions in our
    operating divisions, as well as in our regional and corporate
    offices. We also seek to efficiently manage our advertising
    costs by directing many of our promotional activities toward
    local real estate brokers.

We control construction costs by striving to design our homes
    efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction
    materials and labor. We also seek to negotiate favorable pricing
    from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the
    volume of services and products we purchase from them on a
    local, regional and national basis. We monitor our construction
    costs on each house as well as our inventory levels, margins,
    returns and expenses through our management information systems.

Acquisitions

As negative market conditions in the housing industry persist,
    we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and
    liquidity position. However, we will continue to evaluate
    opportunities for strategic acquisitions or expansions of our
    operations. We believe that the current housing industry
    downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our
    operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding
    companies or distressed real estate properties at attractive
    valuations. In certain instances, such acquisitions can provide
    us benefits not found in

start-up

operations, such as: established land positions and inventories;
    and existing relationships with municipalities, land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers. We seek to limit the
    risks associated with acquiring other companies and distressed
    real estate properties by conducting extensive operational,
    financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by
    performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition
    will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable
    period of time.



Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic
    regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our
    mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our
    homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six
    reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which
    comprise the markets below. Our financial statements contain
    additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for
    purposes of capital allocation, we consider local,
    market-specific factors, including among others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Employment levels and job growth;

•

Median income level of potential homebuyers;

•

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products
    utilized;

•

Market for homes at entry-level price point;

•

Availability of land and lots on acceptable terms;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

New and secondary home sales activity;

•

Competition; and

•

Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing.

Land
    Policies

We acquire land after we have completed due diligence and
    generally after we have obtained the rights (known as
    entitlements) to begin development or construction work
    resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we
    acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other things,
    complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests,
    independent environmental studies and other engineering work,
    and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other
    governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
    property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop
    land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we also
    sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we
    have excess land and lot positions.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain
    the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots
    at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
    anticipated home closings or planned land development. Our
    option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our
    financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and
    lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred
    by us. This enables us to control land and lot positions with
    limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the
    risks associated with land ownership and development.

Almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly
    by us. We have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements
    due to their increased costs and complexity, as well as the loss
    of operational control inherent in such arrangements. We are a
    party to a very small number of joint ventures that were
    acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders. All of
    these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial
    statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory
    risks by:

•

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned)
    in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing
    preferences and related economic developments, such as new job
    opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income
    trends;

•

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•

Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready
    for home construction;

•

Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts,
    where possible;



•

Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional
    upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s
    receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory
    deposits from the buyer; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes
    under construction without an executed sales contract) built in
    each subdivision.

The benefits of this strategy have been limited by the sustained
    weak conditions in the homebuilding industry over the past four
    fiscal years.

Construction

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets
    to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each
    community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features
    to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to
    allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold. We
    have adjusted our product offerings to address affordability
    issues, which have become increasingly important in the current
    weak market conditions.

Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
    subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are retained for a
    specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
    subcontractor to complete construction at an

agreed-upon

price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use
    generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with
    other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials
    and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ construction
    superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate
    in major design and building decisions, coordinate the
    activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of
    subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor
    compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our
    construction superintendents play a significant role in working
    with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home
    modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction
    process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Construction time for our homes depends on the weather,
    availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home,
    and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a
    home within three to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of
    construction materials, except for work in progress materials
    for homes under construction. Generally, the construction
    materials used in our operations are readily available from
    numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
    certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
    at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
    have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of
    materials or labor that have materially affected our
    consolidated operating results.

Marketing
    and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and
    independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales
    from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each
    subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for
    sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel
    assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor
    plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting
    them with the selection of options and other custom features. We
    train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of
    financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising
    plans. As our customers are typically first-time or

move-up

homebuyers, we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing
    within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable. As
    market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers
    with one or more of a variety of incentives, including discounts
    and free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market. Due
    to the weak industry conditions of the past four fiscal years,
    we have offered an increased level of incentives to homebuyers.

We advertise in our local markets as necessary through
    newspapers, marketing brochures, newsletters and email or other
    electronic means to prospective homebuyers and real estate
    brokers. We also use billboards, radio and television
    advertising and our Internet website to market the location,
    price range and availability of



our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate
    in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take
    advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe that model
    homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, so we
    expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in
    our model homes.

In addition to using model homes, we build a limited number of
    speculative homes in each subdivision. These homes enhance our
    marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are
    relocating to these markets, as well as to independent brokers,
    who often represent homebuyers requiring a completed home within
    a short time frame. We determine our speculative homes strategy
    in each market based on local market factors, such as new job
    growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and
    supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends
    and our past experience in the market. We determine the number
    of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our
    current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust
    speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions
    warrant. The significant weakness in our housing markets and
    related high cancellation rates during recent years had caused
    our speculative home inventory to remain higher than our target
    levels. During fiscal 2010, we were able to reduce both total
    and speculative homes in inventory from the prior year levels.
    We expect to maintain a level of speculative home inventory in
    our markets that will be based on our expectations of future
    sales and closings volume. We believe these speculative homes
    help to provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes
    at a profit, reduce our inventory of owned lots and generate
    positive cash flows.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least
    $500. The amount of earnest money required varies between
    markets and subdivisions, and may significantly exceed $500.
    Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional
    deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their
    homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers
    cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain
    their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating
    divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits. Our sales
    contracts also include a financing contingency which permits
    customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if
    they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified
    interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may
    include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing
    home. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of
    sales contracts in fiscal 2010 were 26%, compared to 30% in
    fiscal 2009. While this reflects an improvement from the prior
    year, our cancellation rate continues to be significantly higher
    than our historical rate before the current downturn in the
    homebuilding industry, reflecting the continuing weak housing
    market conditions. The length of time between the signing of a
    sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer
    (closing) is generally from two to six months.

Customer
    Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality
    control inspections and responding to customers’
    post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous
    response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction
    reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for
    quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat
    and referral business from the real estate community and
    homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year
    limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such
    as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited
    warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited
    warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors
    who perform the actual construction also provide us with
    warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond
    to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some
    of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on
    specified products installed in the home.

Sales
    Order Backlog

At September 30, 2010, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $850.8 million (4,128 homes), a decrease of 25%
    from $1,142.0 million (5,628 homes) at September 30,
    2009. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $206,100
    at September 30, 2010, up 2% from the $202,900 average at
    September 30, 2009. Sales order backlog represents homes
    under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many
    of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to
    contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and



buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in
    cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not
    result in closings due to cancellations. Substantially all of
    the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2010 are
    scheduled to close in fiscal year 2011. Further discussion of
    our backlog is provided in Item 7 “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” under Part II of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Customer
    Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage
    coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that
    mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place
    in a timely and efficient manner. DHI Mortgage originates
    mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers and,
    when necessary to fulfill the needs of some homebuyers, also
    brokers loans to third-party lenders who directly originate the
    mortgage loans. During the year ended September 30, 2010,
    approximately 90% of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to
    homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage
    provided mortgage financing services for approximately 61% of
    our total homes closed.

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI
    Mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be
    sold to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage generally sells the
    loans and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers
    shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. In
    markets where we currently do not provide mortgage financing, we
    work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to
    homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs.

Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title
    insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance
    policies, examination and closing services to the purchasers of
    homes we build and sell. We currently assume little or no
    underwriting risk associated with these title policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2010, we employed 3,214 persons, of
    whom 860 were sales and marketing personnel, 1,001 were
    executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 678 were
    involved in construction and 675 worked in mortgage and title
    operations. We had fewer than 10 employees covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. Employees of some of the
    subcontractors that we use are represented by labor unions or
    are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
    our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in
    each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and
    local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw
    materials, skilled labor and financing. We also compete with
    resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market.
    Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design,
    mortgage financing terms and location. In the current weak
    housing market, competition among homebuilders has greatly
    intensified, especially as to pricing and incentives, as
    builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the weak
    housing demand. The current market conditions have also led to a
    large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale, which
    has increased competition for homebuyers and affected pricing.
    Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers
    and other financial institutions, some of which have greater
    access to capital, different lending criteria and potentially
    broader product offerings.

Governmental
    Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex
    regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
    zoning, density and



development requirements, building, environmental, advertising
    and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations
    and requirements affect the development process, as well as
    building materials to be used, building designs and minimum
    elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by local
    authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or
    guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
    and the Veterans Administration (VA) are subject to inspection
    by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the
    administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new
    housing developments may be subject to various assessments for
    schools, parks, streets and other public improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of
    local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
    vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
    the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.

Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also
    comply with various federal and state laws and regulations.
    These include eligibility and other requirements for
    participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, Government
    National Mortgage Association (GNMA), Federal National Mortgage
    Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (Freddie Mac). These also include required
    compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations
    such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against
    discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. All of
    these laws and regulations may subject our operations to
    examination by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Prior to
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, we generally
    had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had
    greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased
    our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations
    during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our
    funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our
    financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a
    result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations
    and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter
    are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal
    year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, the weakness in
    homebuilding market conditions during the past four years has
    mitigated our historical seasonal variations. Also, in fiscal
    2010 the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit impacted
    the timing of our construction activities, home sales and
    closing volumes. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

should be read together with the risk factors set forth below.
    They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may
    become subject to, many of which are difficult to predict or
    beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with
    other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the
    potential to affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material
    and adverse manner.

The
    homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn, and
    its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain. Continued
    weakness or further deterioration in industry conditions or in
    the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse
    effects on our business and financial results.

The downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its fourth year,
    and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in
    U.S. history. The significant declines in the demand for
    new homes, oversupply of homes on the market and reductions in
    the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked
    the downturn are continuing. During the downturn, we have
    experienced material reductions in our home sales and
    homebuilding revenues, and we have incurred material inventory
    and goodwill impairments and other write-offs.



Our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by
    adverse industry and economic conditions. The significant number
    of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven
    down prices, making the purchase of a foreclosed home an
    attractive alternative to purchasing a new home. Homebuilders
    have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation
    rates with significant concessions, further adding to the price
    declines. With the decline in the values of homes and the
    inability of some homeowners to make their mortgage payments,
    the credit markets have been significantly disrupted, putting
    strains on many households and businesses. In the face of these
    conditions, the overall economy has remained very weak, with
    high unemployment levels and substantially reduced consumer
    spending and confidence. As a result, demand for new homes
    remains at historically low levels.

These challenging conditions are complex and interrelated. We
    cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity. Nor can we
    provide assurance that our responses to the homebuilding
    downturn or the government’s attempts to address the
    troubles in the overall economy will be successful.

Constriction
    of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital
    and increase our costs of capital.

During the downturn in the homebuilding industry, we have relied
    principally on our positive operating cash flow to meet our
    working capital needs and repay outstanding indebtedness. We
    generated substantial operating cash flow during this time.
    However, the downturn and the constriction of the credit markets
    have reduced the other sources of liquidity available to us.
    While the public debt markets are currently accessible today at
    historically favorable rates, there were periods during the
    downturn where accessing the public debt markets would have
    increased our cost of capital.

In May 2009, we voluntarily terminated our $1.65 billion
    unsecured revolving credit facility. We have since relied on
    short-term arrangements with some of the former lenders under
    the terminated facility for the letters of credit we require in
    our business. A new line of credit, should we decide to pursue
    one, may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms in the
    current circumstances of our business and the overall economy.
    It would also likely involve additional financing costs and
    restrictions on our business. Our not having a line in place
    could reduce our flexibility in responding to or taking
    advantage of changing conditions in the homebuilding industry or
    require us to use our own cash resources in doing so.

Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, uses a $100 million
    mortgage repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it
    originates. The facility must be renewed annually, and the
    current facility expires in March 2011. A continuation of
    current market conditions could make the renewal more difficult
    or could result in an increase in the cost of the facility or a
    decrease in its committed availability. Such conditions may also
    make it more difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we
    originate.

As of September 30, 2010, we had $296.4 million of
    debt maturing in the next 12 months. We believe we can meet
    these and our other capital requirements with our existing cash
    resources and future cash flows and, if required, other sources
    of financing that we anticipate will be available to us.
    However, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be
    able to do so, particularly if current industry or economic
    conditions continue or deteriorate further. The future effects
    on our business, liquidity and financial results of these
    conditions could be material and adverse, both in ways described
    above and in other ways that we do not currently foresee.

We use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our
    performance under various construction and land development
    agreements, escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other
    arrangements. Should our future performance or economic
    conditions make these more difficult to obtain or more costly,
    our business or financial results could be adversely affected.

The
    reduction in availability of mortgage financing has adversely
    affected our business, and the duration and ultimate severity of
    the effects are uncertain.

Over the last four fiscal years, the mortgage lending industry
    has experienced significant change and contraction. Credit
    requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage
    loans and mortgage-backed securities has been limited to
    securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. This
    has made it



more difficult for many buyers to finance the purchase of our
    homes, thus reducing the pool of qualified homebuyers. These
    reductions in demand have adversely affected our business and
    financial results, and the duration and severity of these
    effects remain uncertain.

We believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie
    Mac and Ginnie Mae to the mortgage industry has been very
    important to the housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
    required substantial injections of capital from the federal
    government and may require additional government support in the
    future. In addition, increased lending volume and losses insured
    by the FHA have resulted in a reduction of its cash reserves.
    Any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by
    these institutions could adversely affect interest rates,
    mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

The FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower loan
    payment requirements and as a result, continue to be a
    particularly important source for financing the sale of our
    homes. In the last two years, more restrictive guidelines have
    been placed on FHA insured loans, affecting minimum down payment
    and availability for condominium financing. In the near future,
    further restrictions are expected on FHA insured loans,
    including but not limited to limitations on seller-paid closing
    costs and concessions. This or any other restriction may
    negatively affect the availability or affordability of FHA
    financing, which could adversely affect our ability to sell
    homes.

While the use of down payment assistance programs by our
    homebuyers has decreased significantly, some of our customers
    still utilize 100% financing through programs offered by the VA
    and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). There can be
    no assurance that these programs or other programs will continue
    to be available or will be as attractive to our customers as the
    programs currently offered, which could negatively affect our
    sales.

Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in
    the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult
    for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who
    need financing.

Mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels. If
    interest rates increase, the costs of owning a home will be
    affected and could result in further reductions in the demand
    for our homes.

Our
    strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the
    homebuilding industry have had limited success, and the
    continued implementation of these and other strategies may not
    be successful.

While we have been successful in generating positive operating
    cash flow and reducing our inventories in the last four fiscal
    years, we have done so at reduced revenue and gross profit
    levels and have incurred significant asset impairment charges,
    resulting in pre-tax losses. Also, during this time,
    notwithstanding our sales strategies, we continued to experience
    an elevated rate of sales contract cancellations. We believe
    that the increase in the cancellation rate is largely due to
    reduced homebuyer confidence, due principally to the weak
    economy and the continuing high level of unemployment. A more
    restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of
    some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted
    cancellations. Many of these factors, which affect new sales and
    cancellation rates, are beyond our control. It is uncertain how
    long the reduction in sales and the increased level of
    cancellations will continue. If these conditions continue for a
    protracted period, it is not clear whether our strategies will
    succeed in maintaining or increasing our sales volume or our
    current margins.

Our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected by
    significant inflation or deflation.

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land,
    materials and labor. In the event of a return of inflation, we
    may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in order to
    maintain satisfactory margins. However, a continuation of the
    oversupply of homes relative to demand may make this difficult.
    In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by
    higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on housing
    demand. In such an environment, we may not be able to raise home
    prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation and
    our margins could decrease. Moreover, with inflation, the costs
    of capital increase and the purchasing power of our cash
    resources can decline. Current or future efforts by the
    government to stimulate



the economy may increase the risk of significant inflation and
    its adverse impact on our business or financial results.

Alternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a
    decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could
    lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions,
    including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation
    could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or
    reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage
    loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of
    existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of
    operations.

The
    homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in
    general economic, real estate or other business conditions that
    could adversely affect our business or financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly
    affected by changes in industry conditions, as well as changes
    in general and local economic conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

consumer confidence;

•

levels of new and existing homes for sale;

•

demographic trends; and

•

housing demand.

These may occur on a national scale, like the current downturn,
    or may affect some of our regions or markets more than others.
    When adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets, they
    could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some
    other homebuilding companies. Our operations in previously
    strong markets, particularly California, Florida, Nevada and
    Arizona, have more adversely affected our financial results than
    our other markets in the current downturn.

An oversupply of alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed
    homes, homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other
    existing homes and rental properties, can also reduce our
    ability to sell new homes, depress new home prices and reduce
    our margins on the sales of new homes. High levels of
    foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory
    available for sale, but also reduce appraisal valuations for new
    homes and the amount that can be financed, potentially resulting
    in lower sales prices.

Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes,
    tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, volcanic activity, droughts,
    and floods, can harm our homebuilding business. These can delay
    home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of
    materials or labor, or damage homes under construction. The
    climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate,
    including California, Florida and Texas, where we have some of
    our larger operations, present increased risks of adverse
    weather or natural disasters.

Continued military deployments in the Middle East and other
    overseas regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or
    threats to national security and any corresponding response by
    the United States or others, or related domestic or
    international instability may adversely affect general economic
    conditions or cause a slowdown of the economy.

As a result of the foregoing matters, potential customers may be
    less willing or able to buy our homes. Because of current
    industry and economic conditions, we have not been able to
    increase the sale prices of our homes. In the future, our
    pricing strategies may also be limited by market conditions. We
    may be unable to further change the mix of our home offerings,
    reduce the costs of the homes we build or offer more affordable
    homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing
    market conditions in other ways. In addition, cancellations of
    home sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers
    choose to not honor their contracts due to any of the factors
    discussed above.



Our financial services business is closely related to our
    homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans
    principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in
    the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may
    also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of
    our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages
    we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the
    mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages
    or may increase our repurchase or other obligations for previous
    originations. We establish reserves related to mortgages we have
    sold; however, actual future obligations related to these
    mortgages could differ significantly from our currently
    estimated amounts.

The
    risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

Inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business.
    The risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing
    land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. Thus, we
    may have acquired options on or bought and developed land or
    lots at a cost we will not be able to recover fully, or on which
    we cannot build and sell homes profitably. As a result, our
    deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar
    contracts may be put at risk. The value of our owned undeveloped
    land, building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate
    significantly as a result of changing market conditions. In
    addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can
    result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing
    community or market. During the current economic downturn, we
    have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we
    have recorded significant inventory impairment charges.

Our goals for years of supply for ownership and control of land
    and building lots are based on management’s expectations
    for future volume growth. In light of the much weaker market
    conditions encountered since fiscal 2006, we have significantly
    slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our development
    spending on land we own. We made substantial land and lot sales
    in fiscal 2008. Throughout the downturn, we also terminated
    numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to these option
    contracts. Because future market conditions are uncertain, we
    cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful
    in managing our future inventory risks.

Supply
    shortages and other risks related to demand for building
    materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay
    deliveries.

The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced
    significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of
    construction, including:

•

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building
    at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers
    want to live;

•

shortages of qualified trades people;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, manufacturers and distributors
    who may be inadequately capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly
    increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are
    significant components of home construction costs.

These factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to
    build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins.

Increases
    in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers
    from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or
    financial results.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage
    interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible
    expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases
    state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under
    current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state
    government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed
    from time to time, to eliminate or substantially modify these
    income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home
    would increase for many of our potential customers.



The loss or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax
    law changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, would
    adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes.

In addition, increases in property tax rates by local
    governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced
    federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
    potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to
    purchase new homes.

Governmental
    regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability
    of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect
    land development and home construction, including zoning,
    density restrictions, building design and building standards.
    These regulations often provide broad discretion to the
    administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we
    must meet prior to development or construction being approved,
    if approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these
    authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities,
    roads or other local services. New housing developments may also
    be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets
    and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets
    government authorities have implemented no growth or growth
    control initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay or increase
    the costs of development or home construction.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal
    laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and
    the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies
    depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining
    properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where
    undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available.
    These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur
    substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs,
    and can prohibit or severely restrict development and
    homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or
    areas.

Governmental
    regulation of our financial services operations could adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

Our financial services operations are subject to numerous
    federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include
    eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan
    programs, compliance with consumer lending and similar
    requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions
    against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures.
    They may also subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies. These factors may limit our ability to
    provide mortgage financing or title services to potential
    purchasers of our homes.

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act (H.R.4173) was signed into law. This legislation
    provides for a number of new requirements relating to
    residential mortgage lending practices, many of which are to be
    developed further by implementing rules. These include, among
    others, minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in
    making mortgages, limitations on certain fees, retention of
    credit risk, prohibition of certain tying arrangements and
    remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings. The effect of
    such provisions on our financial services business will depend
    on the rules that are ultimately enacted.

The turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults and
    resulting foreclosures has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the
    investigation of financial services industry practices by
    governmental authorities. These investigations could include the
    examination of consumer lending practices, sales of mortgages to
    financial institutions and other investors, and current
    foreclosure processes or other practices in the financial
    services segments of homebuilding companies. We are unable to
    assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in
    changes in regulations, homebuilding industry practices or
    adversely affect the costs and potential profitability of
    homebuilding companies.



Homebuilding
    is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in
    the ordinary course of business that can be
    significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and
    construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability
    insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from
    subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship
    and materials. We establish warranty and other reserves for the
    homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and
    our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types
    of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these
    matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance
    coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will
    be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction
    defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be
    difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable
    self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
    covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits.
    Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of
    product liability insurance for construction defects is
    currently limited and costly. We have responded to increases in
    insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by
    increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There
    can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted
    or become more costly.

Our
    substantial debt could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30,
    2010, our consolidated debt was $2,171.8 million. As of
    September 30, 2010, the scheduled maturities of principal
    on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months
    totaled $296.4 million. The indentures governing our senior
    and convertible senior notes do not restrict the incurrence of
    future unsecured debt, and they permit significant amounts of
    secured debt. We do not currently have a revolving credit
    facility for our homebuilding operations. If we choose to enter
    into a new line of credit agreement, it may limit the amount of
    debt we could incur.

Possible Consequences.

The amount and the
    maturities of our debt could have important consequences. For
    example, they could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payment of our debt and reduce our ability to
    use our cash flow for other operating or investing purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the
    changes in our business;

•

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements or other requirements;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt
    than some of our competitors; and

•

make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or general
    economic conditions.

In addition, the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions
    imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us
    to additional risks, including:

Dependence on Future Performance.

Our ability
    to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend, in
    part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results
    are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this
    report. These have been compounded by the current industry and
    economic conditions. Our revenues and earnings vary with the
    level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our
    businesses are also affected by financial, political, business
    and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
    factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect
    our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through
    the sale of debt or equity, the refinancing of debt, or the sale
    of assets.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility and Other
    Restrictions.

The mortgage repurchase facility
    for our financial services subsidiaries requires the maintenance
    of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable
    ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of
    liquidity by our financial services subsidiaries. A failure to
    comply with these requirements could allow the lending bank to
    terminate the availability of funds to the financial services
    subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior



to maturity. Any difficulty experienced in complying with these
    covenants could make the renewal of the facility more difficult
    or costly.

In addition, although our financial services business is
    conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our
    indentures, the ability of our financial services subsidiaries
    to provide funds to our homebuilding operations is subject to
    restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility. These funds
    would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the
    continuance of defaults under this facility. Moreover, our right
    to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation
    or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the
    creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims we may have to funds
    from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary
    indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness
    and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our
    claims.

The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on
    the creation of secured debt and liens.

Changes in Debt Ratings.

In fiscal 2008, all
    three of the agencies that rate our senior unsecured debt
    lowered our ratings to a level below investment grade, and these
    agencies have since lowered our ratings further. Any additional
    lowering of our debt ratings could make entering into a new line
    of credit agreement or accessing the public capital markets more
    difficult

and/or

more
    expensive.

Change of Control Purchase Options.

If a
    change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing
    $587.8 million principal amount of our senior notes as of
    September 30, 2010, we would be required to offer to
    purchase these notes at 101% of their principal amount, together
    with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If a fundamental
    change, including a change of control, occurs as defined in the
    indenture governing our convertible senior notes, which
    constituted $500 million principal amount as of
    September 30, 2010, we would be required to offer to
    purchase these notes at par, together with all accrued and
    unpaid interest, if any. If purchase offers were required under
    the indentures for these notes, we can give no assurance that we
    would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be
    required to purchase.

Potential Future Restrictions.

As a result of
    terminating our revolving credit facility, we are no longer
    subject to the restrictions on our operations and activities
    that it imposed on us. However, if we decide to enter into
    another revolving credit agreement, it is likely that we will
    again become subject to these types of provisions, which may be
    more restrictive than those found in our previous facility.

Homebuilding
    and financial services are very competitive industries, and
    competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or
    financial results.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders
    compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable
    properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We
    compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders,
    often within larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed
    by such homebuilders. We also compete with existing home sales,
    foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions
    in the homebuilding industry can result in:

•

lower sales;

•

lower selling prices;

•

increased selling incentives;

•

lower profit margins;

•

impairments in the value of inventory, goodwill and other assets;

•

difficulty in acquiring suitable land, raw materials, and
    skilled labor at acceptable prices or terms; or

•

delays in construction of our homes.

Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks
    and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders with greater
    access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to
    offer more attractive financing to potential customers.



These competitive conditions could adversely affect our business
    and financial results. In the current downturn in the
    homebuilding industry, the reactions of our competitors may have
    reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve pricing
    stability and reduce our inventory levels.

We
    cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies
    will be successful or not expose us to additional
    risks.

Although we focused on internal growth for several years before
    the downturn in the homebuilding industry, we may in the future
    make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their
    assets. Successful strategic acquisitions require the
    integration of operations and management. Although we believe
    that we have been successful in the past, we can give no
    assurance that we would be able to successfully identify,
    acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders
    if we issue our common stock as consideration, or reduce our
    liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash. The
    impact on liquidity may be increased because we do not currently
    have a revolving credit facility. In addition, acquisitions can
    expose us to valuation risks, including the risk of writing off
    goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such
    acquisitions. The risk of goodwill and other asset impairments
    increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our
    profitability may decline, as evidenced by the goodwill and
    other asset impairment charges we recognized in recent years. In
    addition, we may not be able to successfully implement our
    operating or internal growth strategies within our existing
    markets. In the uncertain current market conditions, asset
    acquisitions involve a risk that the markets involved may
    subsequently deteriorate. Conversely, if we delay an acquisition
    until we believe the market uncertainties are resolved, the
    potential competitive advantages of the acquisition may be
    limited.

We may
    not realize our deferred income tax asset.

As of September 30, 2010, we have a net deferred income tax
    asset of $902.6 million, against which we have provided a
    valuation allowance of $902.6 million. The realization of
    our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the generation
    of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward
    periods in which the related temporary differences become
    deductible.

The accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates
    of future results. Differences between the anticipated and
    actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a
    material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
    financial position. Changes in tax laws also affect actual tax
    results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over
    time.

The
    utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if
    we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal
    Revenue Code.

We have experienced continuing tax net operating losses through
    fiscal 2010 and have potential unrealized built-in losses. These
    tax net operating losses have the potential to reduce future
    income tax obligations if we realize taxable income in the
    future. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code
    contains rules that limit the ability of a company that
    undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss
    carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years
    after the ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership
    change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of
    its stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in
    accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by
    focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered
    by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the
    stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from
    new issuances of stock by the company.

If we undergo an ownership change for purposes of
    Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving
    our common stock, both the amount of and our ability to use any
    of our net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit
    carryforwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of
    ownership change would be subject to the limitations of
    Section 382. In addition, these limitations may affect the
    expiration date of a portion of our built-in losses, any net
    operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards, and we
    may not



be able to use them before they expire. This could adversely
    affect our financial position, results of operations and cash
    flow.

We do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change
    as of September 30, 2010; however, the amount by which our
    ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and
    sales of stock by 5% stockholders; the potential conversion of
    our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to
    whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially
    in stock; and new issuances of stock by us.

PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own

    915,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring
    through October 2015. These properties are located in our
    various operating markets to house our homebuilding and

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the

    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the
    liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves
    relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that
    could be significant.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations — Fiscal Year 2010 Overview

In fiscal 2010, conditions within the homebuilding industry
    remained challenging, primarily due to weak overall economic
    conditions, high unemployment and low consumer confidence.
    Demand for new homes improved while the federal homebuyer tax
    credit was in effect, but decreased sharply once the tax credit
    expired. Our net sales orders for fiscal 2010 were 14% higher
    than in fiscal 2009; however, much of the

year-over-year

increase was attributable to our results in the first half of
    the year before the federal homebuyer tax credit expired.
    Subsequent to its expiration, our net sales orders in the third
    and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 were 3% and 21% lower,
    respectively, than in the comparable prior year periods. These
    results suggest that efforts to improve our net sales order
    volume will be challenging and that overall demand for new homes
    is likely to remain at very low levels for some time.

During the ongoing slowdown in the homebuilding industry that
    began in 2006, numerous factors have hurt demand for new homes
    on a pervasive and persistent basis across the United States.
    These factors include high inventory levels of available homes,
    elevated sales order cancellation rates, low sales absorption
    rates and overall weak consumer confidence. The effects of these
    factors have been magnified by reduced availability of credit in
    the mortgage markets and high levels of home foreclosures. High
    levels of foreclosures not only contribute to additional
    inventory available for sale, but also reduce appraisal
    valuations for new homes, potentially resulting in lower sales
    prices. The overall economy remains weak, with a high level of
    unemployment, substantially reduced consumer spending and low
    levels of consumer confidence. The turmoil in the housing market
    has resulted in substantial price reductions in our homes during
    the course of the slowdown.

In the first half of fiscal 2010 there were indications of some
    stabilization of housing market conditions. The factors
    supporting the improved conditions included increased levels of
    affordability resulting from lower home sales prices; declines
    in the number of new homes available for sale; a low mortgage
    interest rate environment; and the federal government’s
    monetary and fiscal policies and programs, including the federal
    homebuyer tax credit, which encouraged home ownership and home
    purchases. These market conditions supported our strategy of
    opening new communities via lot option contracts and starting
    construction on more unsold homes to provide affordable housing
    and capture demand from first-time and

move-up

homebuyers. Having additional housing inventory available to
    close before the expiration of the federal tax credit resulted
    in significant increases in our net sales orders during the
    first half of fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period.
    During fiscal 2010, our homes closed and our gross profit as a
    percentage of home sales revenues increased from fiscal 2009,
    which resulted in pre-tax income of $99.5 million in 2010
    compared to a pre-tax loss of $556.8 million in 2009.

The decline in demand subsequent to the expiration of the tax
    credit indicates that market conditions in the homebuilding
    industry are weak and the timing of a sustainable recovery
    remains uncertain. We are maintaining our cautious outlook for
    the homebuilding industry, and will adjust our operating
    strategy as necessary as we continually assess the level of
    underlying demand for new homes in our communities. However, we
    presently expect that our level of home sales, closings and
    profitability will be lower in fiscal 2011 than fiscal 2010.

Our future results could be negatively impacted by prolonged
    weakness in the economy, continued high levels of unemployment,
    a significant increase in mortgage interest rates or further
    tightening of mortgage lending standards.

Due to these uncertain market conditions, we have continued to
    evaluate our homebuilding and financial services assets for
    recoverability. Our assets whose recoverability is most impacted
    by market conditions include inventory, earnest money deposits
    and pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot option
    contracts, tax assets and owned mortgage loans. These assets
    collectively represented approximately 89% of our total assets,
    excluding cash and marketable securities, at September 30,
    2010. Our evaluations reflected our expectation of continued
    challenges in the homebuilding industry. Based on our
    evaluations, during fiscal 2010 we recorded



inventory impairment charges of $62.3 million, wrote-off
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land
    and lot option contracts we no longer plan to pursue of
    $2.4 million, recorded additional reserves for losses of
    $13.7 million associated with mortgage loans held in
    portfolio and the limited recourse provisions on previously sold
    mortgage loans and increased the reserve related to mortgage
    reinsurance activities by $1.9 million. Inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs declined in fiscal 2010 from prior years,
    reflecting an improvement in gross profit from home closings
    during fiscal 2010 compared to prior years. We will evaluate
    whether further impairment charges, valuation adjustments or
    write-offs are necessary on these assets in the coming quarters.
    Additional discussion of these evaluations and charges is
    presented below.

Strategy

We believe the long-term fundamental factors which support
    housing demand, namely population growth and household
    formation, remain positive. In the near term, however, it is not
    possible to predict if current homebuilding industry conditions
    will improve or if they will deteriorate from current levels.
    During the downturn we have increased our cash balances by
    generating cash flow from operations, primarily through
    reductions in inventory and mortgage loans held for sale, the
    receipt of tax refunds and by accessing the capital markets.
    While we will continue to conservatively manage our business,
    our increased liquidity provides us with flexibility in
    determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our
    communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash
    flow generation and potential profit. With this flexibility, we
    are committed to continuing the following initiatives related to
    our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business
    environment:

•

Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position.

•

Managing the sales prices and level of sales incentives on our
    homes as necessary to optimize the balance of sales volumes,
    profits, returns on inventory investments and cash flows.

•

Entering into new lot option contracts to purchase finished lots
    to potentially increase sales volumes and profitability.

•

Renegotiating existing lot option contracts to reduce our lot
    costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with new home
    demand in each community.

•

Limiting land development spending, especially in communities
    that require substantial investments of time or capital
    resources.

•

Managing our inventory of homes under construction by
    selectively starting construction on unsold homes to capture new
    home demand, while monitoring the number and aging of unsold
    homes and aggressively marketing unsold, completed homes in
    inventory.

•

Decreasing the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and
    subcontractors.

•

Modifying product offerings to provide more affordable homes.

•

Controlling our SG&A infrastructure to match production
    levels.

These initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows
    from operations during the downturn and to achieve improved
    operating results during fiscal 2010. Although we cannot provide
    any assurances that these initiatives will be successful in the
    future, we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to
    continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity
    position in fiscal 2011.

Results
    of Operations — Homebuilding

Our operating segments are our 33 homebuilding operating
    divisions, which we aggregate into six reporting segments. These
    reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions,
    have homebuilding operations located in the following states:

East:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, New Mexico (Las Cruces only), Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a change in the
    composition of our operating divisions required that the Las
    Cruces, New Mexico market, previously included in our Southwest
    reporting segment, now be included in our South Central
    reporting segment. Consequently, throughout this discussion, we
    have restated the prior year amounts between segments to conform
    to the current year presentation.

Net
    Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders increased 15%, to
    $4,011.0 million (19,375 homes) in 2010 from
    $3,498.4 million (17,034 homes) in 2009. The number of net
    sales orders increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal
    2009. These results were impacted by increased levels of
    affordability resulting from lower home sales prices, recent
    declines in the number of new homes available for sale, a low
    mortgage interest rate environment, and the federal
    government’s monetary and fiscal policies and programs,
    including the federal homebuyer tax credit, which accelerated
    sales demand during the first half of the year. Although these
    results reflect improvement over the prior year and suggest the
    severe declines in our net sales orders experienced in recent
    years may be moderating, the significant decline in demand
    subsequent to the expiration of the federal tax credit indicates
    that market conditions are weak and the timing of a sustainable
    housing recovery remains uncertain.

In comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009, the value of net sales
    orders increased in most of our market regions, with the largest
    percentage increases occurring in our East, Southeast and South
    Central regions resulting from new communities in the Carolinas,
    Florida and Texas, as well as lower cancellation rates achieved
    in these regions. Conversely, our Midwest region experienced a
    13% decline in net sales orders, due to continued weak demand in
    our Chicago market. Fluctuations in the value of net sales
    orders were primarily due to the change in the number of homes
    sold in each respective region, and to a much lesser extent,
    small fluctuations in the average selling price of those homes.
    Our sales volumes in the future will depend on the strength of
    the overall economy, employment levels and our ability to
    successfully implement our operating strategies in each of our
    markets.

The average price of our net sales orders in 2010 was $207,000,
    an increase of 1% from the $205,400 average in 2009. We will
    continue our efforts to offer affordable product offerings to
    our target customer base and will seek to adjust our product
    mix, geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets
    to meet market conditions.

Our annual sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders
    divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 26% in fiscal
    2010, compared to 30% in fiscal 2009. This cancellation rate
    continues to be above historical levels. Our ability to reduce
    it to historical levels depends largely on the strength of the
    overall economy and our ability to successfully implement our
    operating strategies in each of our markets. We anticipate that
    cancellation rates will continue to fluctuate significantly
    until there is sustained stability in market conditions.

Sales
    Order Backlog

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet
    closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our
    sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including
    mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes,
    which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in
    backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations, which
    during the recent housing downturn have been substantial.

Our homes in backlog at September 30, 2010 declined 27%
    from the prior year as a result of closing homes at a greater
    rate than our sales pace during the latter half of the year and
    the effects of the federal homebuyer tax credit that was in
    effect at September 30, 2009. Given our lower level of
    backlog at the beginning of fiscal 2011 as compared to the level
    at the beginning of fiscal 2010, we expect that our 2011 first
    quarter closings and revenues will be lower than in the prior
    year. Additionally, should the sales trends of the second half
    of fiscal 2010 continue into the first half of fiscal 2011, our
    full year closings and revenues will likely be lower in 2011
    than 2010.

Home
    Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales increased 21%, to $4,302.3 million
    (20,875 homes closed) in 2010 from $3,563.6 million (16,703
    homes closed) in 2009. The average selling price of homes closed
    during 2010 was $206,100, down 3% from the $213,400 average in
    2009. During fiscal 2010, home sales revenues increased in most
    of our market regions, with significant increases in our East,
    Southeast and South Central markets. These increases resulted
    from increases in the number of homes closed.

The number of homes closed in 2010 increased 25% due to
    increases in five of our six market regions. The increase in
    home closings reflects the impact of the first-time
    homebuyer’s federal tax credit, which initially required
    buyers to close on their home purchase transaction by
    June 30, 2010. We believe this helped stimulate demand for
    homes that could close during the first nine months of fiscal
    2010. We also believe that our operating strategy of selectively
    starting construction on unsold homes, which made additional
    housing inventory available to close by June 30, 2010, led
    to increased home closings volume by better capturing this
    demand. The Southwest region had an 8% decrease in homes closed
    due to both weak demand in the Phoenix market and our prior year
    efforts to reduce completed home inventories in that market. As
    conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate,
    our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number
    of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate.

Home
    Sales Gross Profit

Gross profit from home sales increased by 59%, to
    $744.0 million in 2010, from $467.5 million in 2009,
    and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, increased
    420 basis points, to 17.3%. Approximately 350 basis
    points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage
    was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more
    than our average selling prices, caused largely by a reduction
    in our construction costs on homes closed during the current
    year. The reduction in construction costs primarily results from
    changes in product design, as well as cost reductions obtained
    from our suppliers and

sub-contractors

in prior periods. In addition, the increase in home sales gross
    profit is partially due to our efforts beginning in fiscal 2009
    to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and
    close houses from these new projects. Homes closed on these
    recently acquired finished lots yielded higher gross profits
    than those on land and lots acquired in prior years.
    Approximately 70 basis points of the increase was due to a
    decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues,
    resulting from reductions in our interest and property taxes
    incurred over the past year, as well as more closings occurring
    on acquired finished lots, rather than internally developed lots.

Future changes in gross profit percentages are impacted by the
    use of sales incentives and price adjustments to generate an
    adequate volume of home closings. We expect our gross profit
    percentage to decline in the first half of fiscal 2011 due to
    current weak housing market conditions.

Land
    Sales Revenue

Land sales revenues decreased 82% to $7.4 million in 2010,
    from $40.3 million in 2009. Of the $40.3 million of
    revenues in fiscal 2009, $26.9 million related to land sale
    transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which
    recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of
    the sale. Fluctuations in revenues from land sales are a
    function of how we manage our inventory levels in various
    markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to
    build and sell homes on them; however, we occasionally purchase
    land that includes commercially zoned parcels which we typically
    sell to commercial developers, and we also sell residential lots
    or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply. Land and lot
    sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of
    profitability. Therefore, the revenues and gross profit from
    land sales fluctuate from period to period. As of
    September 30, 2010, we had $3.3 million of land held
    for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.

A community may consist of land
    held for development, residential land and lots developed and
    under development, and construction in progress and finished
    homes. A particular community often includes inventory in more
    than one category. Further, a community may contain multiple
    parcels with varying product types (e.g. entry level and

move-up

single family detached, as well as attached product types). Some
    communities have no homes under construction, finished homes, or
    current home sales efforts or activity.



Inventory
    Impairments and Land Option Cost Write-offs

During fiscal 2010, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized reflected our
    expectation of continued challenging conditions and
    uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets.
    As we continue to evaluate the strength of the economy (measured
    largely in terms of job growth), the level of underlying demand
    for new homes and our operating performance, the level of
    impairments in future quarters will likely fluctuate and may
    increase. Our impairment evaluation as of September 30,
    2010 indicated communities with a combined carrying value of
    $409.8 million had indicators of potential impairment, and
    these communities were evaluated for impairment. The analysis of
    the large majority of these communities assumed that sales
    prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current
    sales order prices in each community, or in comparable
    communities, in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate.
    For a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop
    or operate in current market conditions, slight increases over
    current sales prices were assumed. While it is difficult to
    determine a timeframe for a given community in the current
    market conditions, we estimated the remaining lives of these
    communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years.
    In performing this analysis, we utilized a range of discount
    rates for communities of 14% to 20%. Through this evaluation
    process, we determined that communities with a carrying value of
    $63.1 million as of September 30, 2010, were impaired.
    As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
    recorded impairment charges of $29.1 million to reduce the
    carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated
    fair value, as compared to $174.9 million in the same
    period of the prior year. The fourth quarter charges combined
    with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in
    total inventory impairment charges of $62.3 million and
    $377.8 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at
    the community level. When an impairment charge for a community
    is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the
    community in the same manner as land and development costs are
    allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is
    categorized as construction in progress and finished homes,
    residential land and lots developed and under development, and
    land held for development, based on the stage of production or
    plans for future development. During fiscal 2010, approximately
    93% of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land
    and lots and land held for development, and approximately 7% of
    the charges were recorded to construction in progress and
    finished homes inventory, compared to 85% and 15%, respectively,
    in fiscal 2009.

Of the remaining $346.7 million carrying value of
    communities with impairment indicators which were determined not
    to be impaired at September 30, 2010, the largest
    concentrations were in California (22%), Illinois (17%), Arizona
    (10%), Texas (9%), Florida (9%) and New Jersey (8%). It is
    possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these
    communities may change and could result in a future need to
    record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of these
    assets to their estimated fair value. There are several factors
    which could lead to changes in the estimates of undiscounted
    future cash flows for a given community. The most significant of
    these include pricing and incentive levels actually realized by
    the community, the rate at which the homes are sold and the
    costs incurred to develop the lots and construct the homes. The
    pricing and incentive levels are often inter-related with sales
    pace within a community, such that a price reduction can be
    expected to increase the sales pace. Further, both of these
    factors are heavily influenced by the competitive pressures
    facing a given community from both new homes and existing homes,
    some of which may result from foreclosures. If conditions worsen
    in the broader economy, homebuilding industry or specific
    markets in which we operate, and as we re-evaluate specific
    community pricing and incentives, construction and development
    plans, and our overall land sale strategies, we may be required
    to evaluate additional communities or re-evaluate previously
    impaired communities for potential impairment. These evaluations
    may result in additional impairment charges.

Based on our quarterly reviews of land and lot option contracts,
    we have written off earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to contracts for land or lots which are not
    expected to be acquired. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we wrote
    off $2.4 million and $29.9 million, respectively, of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land
    option contracts. At September 30, 2010, outstanding
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs associated with
    our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled
    $13.3 million and $11.0 million, respectively.



The inventory impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding
    gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    approximately 150 basis points in fiscal 2010, compared to
    1,130 basis points in fiscal 2009.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities decreased
    slightly to $522.0 million in 2010 from $523.0 million
    in 2009. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A
    expense decreased 240 basis points, to 12.1% in 2010 from
    14.5% in 2009. The largest component of our homebuilding
    SG&A expense is employee compensation and related costs,
    which represented 58% and 55% of SG&A costs in 2010 and
    2009, respectively. These costs increased by 6%, to
    $304.0 million in 2010 from $287.2 million in 2009.
    Our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2,500 and
    2,300 employees at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

A portion of compensation expense relates to our long-term
    incentive bonus program, which provides for the Compensation
    Committee of our Board of Directors to award performance units
    to our Chairman of the Board and our Chief Executive Officer.
    The actual number of performance units earned is based upon our
    level of achievement on defined performance metrics as compared
    to our peer group. The earned award will have a value equal to
    the number of earned units multiplied by the closing price of
    our common stock at the end of the performance period and may be
    paid in cash, equity or a combination of both. The Compensation
    Committee has the discretion to reduce the final payout on the
    performance units from the amount earned. Performance units were
    granted in 2008 and 2009 with

33-month

performance periods ending on September 30, 2010 and 2011,
    respectively. Our liability for these awards has been based on
    our performance against the peer group, the elapsed portion of
    the performance period and our stock price as of each reporting
    date, and previously assumed no future reduction of the earned
    value of the performance units by the Compensation Committee.
    Because the values of the earned performance units are dependent
    on our performance and our common stock price, and because the
    final amount can be reduced at the discretion of the
    Compensation Committee, this liability has been subject to a
    high degree of volatility.

Subsequent to September 30, 2010, the Compensation
    Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the amount earned
    under the 2008 performance unit grant to $4.9 million and
    expects to limit the amount which may be earned under the 2009
    performance unit grant to approximately $4.1 million. The
    liability related to the 2008 and 2009 performance unit grants
    was $9.0 million and $11.3 million at
    September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009,
    respectively. Compensation expense (benefit) related to these
    grants were ($2.3) million and $7.7 million for fiscal
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

We continually attempt to adjust our SG&A infrastructure to
    support our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make
    assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or
    improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of
    revenues. It has become more difficult to reduce SG&A
    expense as the size of our operations has decreased. If revenues
    decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our SG&A,
    future SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues will
    increase.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during
    active development and construction. Due to the decrease in the
    size of our operations, our inventory under active development
    and construction has been lower than our debt level; therefore,
    a portion of our interest incurred must be expensed. We expensed
    $86.3 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2010,
    compared to $100.2 million of interest during fiscal 2009.

Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written
    off with inventory impairment charges, was 3.4% of total home
    and land/lot cost of sales in 2010, compared to 3.9% in 2009.
    Interest incurred is related to the average level of our
    homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2010 with fiscal 2009, interest incurred related to
    homebuilding debt decreased 16% to $173.2 million,
    primarily due to a 19% decrease in our average homebuilding debt.



Gain/Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

We retired $822.2 million principal amount of our senior
    and senior subordinated notes prior to their maturity during
    fiscal 2010, compared to $380.3 million in fiscal 2009.
    Related to the early retirement of these notes, we recognized a
    net loss of $4.9 million in fiscal 2010 and a net gain of
    $11.5 million in fiscal 2009, which represents the
    difference between the principal amount of the notes and the
    aggregate purchase price, less any unamortized discounts and
    fees. The loss in fiscal 2010 includes a loss of
    $2.0 million for the call premium related to the early
    redemption of our 5.875% senior notes due 2013. The gain in
    fiscal 2009 was partially offset by a $7.6 million loss
    related to the early termination of our revolving credit
    facility in May 2009.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $9.2 million in 2010, compared
    to $12.8 million in 2009. The largest component of other
    income in both years was interest income.

Goodwill

In performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we
    estimate the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the
    present values of expected future cash flows. As a result of the
    analysis performed as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, we
    determined that the fair value of our operating segments was
    greater than their carrying value and therefore, no impairment
    of goodwill existed. As of September 30, 2010 and 2009, our
    goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of which related to
    our South Central reporting segment. The goodwill assessment
    procedures require management to make comprehensive estimates of
    future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated
    with such estimates, actual results could differ from these
    estimates.

Expenses maintained at the
    corporate level consist primarily of interest and property
    taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or
    expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our
    corporate office. The amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the
    segment’s revenue, while the interest expensed directly and
    those expenses associated with the corporate office are
    allocated to each segment based on the segment’s average
    inventory.

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues increased
    42% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in
    the number of homes closed, with the largest increases occurring
    in our New Jersey and Carolina markets. The region reported a
    loss before income taxes of $6.3 million in 2010, compared
    to a loss of $95.9 million in 2009. The results were due in
    part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $8.6 million and
    $64.9 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of
    home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage)
    increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009. The increase was a result of a



reduction in the construction costs of our homes closed during
    fiscal 2010. Also, a reduction in the region’s SG&A
    expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed
    420 basis points to the region’s improvement in loss
    before income taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, as
    the region’s additional closing volume helped leverage
    these SG&A expenses.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 5% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to
    increases in the number of homes closed in all of the
    region’s markets. The region reported a loss before income
    taxes of $31.3 million in 2010, compared to a loss of
    $104.9 million in 2009. The results were due in part to
    inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $22.0 million and
    $54.7 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    920 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase was a result of higher margins primarily in our
    Chicago and Denver markets. The Denver market also benefitted
    from lower warranty costs on previously closed homes. In fiscal
    2010, a reduction in the region’s SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 280 basis
    points to the region’s improvement in loss before income
    taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues. Although these
    results reflect improvement over the prior year, we experienced
    a significant decline in net sales orders in this region during
    recent quarters. This decline was due to continued weak demand
    in our Chicago market, and we expect conditions in this market
    to remain challenging in the near-term. Substantially all of our
    fiscal 2010 impairments for this region related to projects in
    our Chicago market.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 31% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, with the largest
    increases occurring in our central Florida and Atlanta markets.
    The region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $7.5 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a loss of
    $73.2 million in fiscal 2009. The results were due in part
    to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $17.5 million and
    $38.0 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    460 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets, led by our south and
    central Florida markets. The increase in homes sales gross
    profit percentage was a result of construction costs declining
    at a faster rate than the decline in average selling price on
    homes closed during fiscal 2010. Also contributing to the
    increase in home sales gross profit are our efforts since the
    beginning of fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new
    communities and construct and close houses from these new
    projects. Homes closed on these recently acquired finished lots
    are generally yielding higher gross profits than those on land
    and lots acquired in prior years. In fiscal 2010, a reduction in
    the region’s SG&A expenses as a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues contributed 250 basis points to the
    region’s improvement in income before income taxes as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues as the region’s
    additional closing volume helped leverage these SG&A
    expenses.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 35% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, with the largest
    increases occurring in our Central Texas, Houston and
    Dallas/Fort Worth markets. The region reported income
    before income taxes of $83.4 million in fiscal 2010,
    compared to income of $4.9 million in fiscal 2009. The
    improvement was due in large part to the increase in revenue,
    combined with the region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage increasing 290 basis points in fiscal 2010
    compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets. These higher margins
    were primarily attributable to reductions in construction costs
    of our homes. Additionally, a decrease in inventory impairment
    charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs,
    which were $14.0 million in fiscal 2010 compared to
    $20.0 million in fiscal 2009, contributed to the
    region’s increase in income before income taxes.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 14% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a decrease in the
    number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those
    homes. The decreases in revenues and homes closed were due to
    continuing weakness in the Phoenix market. The region reported
    income before income taxes of $12.0 million in 2010,
    compared to a loss before income taxes of $45.8 million in
    2009. The loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs totaling $39.4 million. The region’s home
    sales gross profit percentage increased 330 basis points in
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was a result
    of the average cost of the region’s homes



declining by more than the average selling prices, driven in
    large part by reductions in home construction costs. In
    addition, the increase in home sales gross profit is partially
    due to our recent efforts to acquire lot positions in new
    communities and construct and close houses from these projects.
    In fiscal 2010, a reduction in the region’s SG&A
    expenses, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues, also contributed to the improvement in
    income before income taxes.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues increased
    6% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to an increase in the number of
    homes closed, which was partially offset by a decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The largest increases in
    homes closed occurred in our Seattle and Southern California
    markets. The region reported income before income taxes of
    $27.8 million in 2010, compared to a loss before income
    taxes of $226.4 million in 2009. The loss in 2009 was due
    in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money
    and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $190.7 million, compared to $2.0 million in 2010. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    400 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets, driven in large part
    by reductions in home construction costs. In fiscal 2010, a
    reduction in the region’s SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 260 basis
    points to the region’s improvement in income before income
    taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, as a result of
    absolute reductions in SG&A expenses, as well as the
    additional revenue providing more leverage against these costs.

Excludes approximately 7,300 and
    7,000 lots at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    representing lots controlled under lot option contracts for
    which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the
    land or lots, and have reserved the deposits related to these
    contracts but the underlying contract has not yet been
    terminated.

At September 30, 2010, we owned or controlled approximately
    119,400 lots, compared to approximately 108,700 lots at
    September 30, 2009. Of the 119,400 total lots, we
    controlled approximately 29,700 lots (25%), which have a total
    remaining purchase price of approximately $963.9 million,
    through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of
    $13.3 million in earnest money deposits. At
    September 30, 2010, approximately 22,800 of our owned lots
    were finished.

We had a total of approximately 9,500 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,200 model homes at September 30,
    2010, compared to approximately 11,600 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,100 model homes at September 30,
    2009. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 5,200 and
    5,800 were unsold at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. At September 30, 2010, approximately 3,200 of
    our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 800
    homes had been completed for more than six



months. At September 30, 2009, approximately 2,200 of our
    unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 800 homes
    had been completed for more than six months.

Our current strategy is to take advantage of market
    opportunities by entering into new lot option contracts to
    purchase finished lots in selected communities to potentially
    increase sales volumes and profitability. We will attempt to
    renegotiate existing lot option contracts as necessary to reduce
    our lot costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with
    new home demand in each community. We also manage our inventory
    of homes under construction by selectively starting construction
    on unsold homes to capture new home demand, while monitoring the
    number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our
    unsold, completed homes in inventory.

Net
    Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders decreased 25%, to
    $3,498.4 million (17,034 homes) in 2009 from
    $4,677.2 million (21,251 homes) in 2008. The number of net
    sales orders decreased 20% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal
    2008. Factors that contributed to the slowing of demand for new
    homes in most of our



markets included a high level of homes for sale, which included
    foreclosed homes for sale; a decrease in the availability of
    mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers; the continued
    uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer
    consumer confidence. However, these factors led to lower home
    prices and improved affordability, which combined with various
    homebuyer tax incentives and low mortgage interest rates, served
    to partially offset some of the market softness.

In comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008, the value of net sales
    orders decreased in all of our market regions. In most market
    regions, these decreases were due to a decrease in the number of
    homes sold in the respective regions, and to a lesser extent, to
    a decline in the average selling price of those homes. In the
    East and Southeast regions where decreases in the number of
    homes sold were not as large as other regions, the decline in
    average selling price was a greater contributor to the decrease
    in the value of net sales orders.

The average price of our net sales orders decreased 7%, to
    $205,400 in 2009 from $220,100 in 2008. The average price of our
    net sales orders decreased in five of our six market regions,
    due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives
    implemented to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales
    absorption pace. As the inventory of existing homes for sale,
    which included a substantial number of foreclosed homes,
    continued to be high, we adjusted our pricing to remain
    competitive with comparable existing home sales prices. We also
    adjusted our product mix, geographic mix and pricing within our
    homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product
    offerings affordable for our target customer base, typically
    first-time and

move-up

homebuyers, which also contributed to the decrease in average
    selling price.

Our annual sales order cancellation rate was 30% in fiscal 2009,
    compared to 40% in fiscal 2008. While an improvement from the
    prior year, this elevated cancellation rate reflects the
    challenges in most of our homebuilding markets, including the
    inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing
    homes, the erosion of buyer confidence and the tight credit
    conditions in the mortgage markets.

In July 2008, the “American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure
    Prevention Act of 2008” was enacted into law. Among other
    provisions, this law eliminated seller-funded down payment
    assistance on FHA insured loans approved on or after
    October 1, 2008. Of our total home closings in fiscal 2008,
    approximately 25% were funded with mortgage loans whereby the
    homebuyer used a seller-financed down payment assistance
    program. While we sought other down payment assistance and
    mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers, the elimination
    of the seller-financed down payment assistance programs had a
    negative impact on our sales and revenues in fiscal 2009
    relative to fiscal 2008.

In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
    2009 was enacted into law. This legislation included a federal
    tax credit for qualified first-time homebuyers purchasing a
    principal residence on or after January 1, 2009 and before
    December 1, 2009. In November 2009, this credit was
    expanded to be available to more homebuyers and extended until
    June 2010.

Sales
    Order Backlog

At September 30, 2009, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $1,142.0 million (5,628 homes), a decrease of 5%
    from $1,207.4 million (5,297 homes) at September 30,
    2008. The average sales price of homes



in backlog was $202,900 at September 30, 2009, down 11%
    from the $227,900 average at September 30, 2008. The

year-over-year

increase in home sales activity in the fourth quarter
    contributed to modest increases in the value of our sales order
    backlog in four of our six market regions. However, the value of
    our backlog decreased significantly in our Southwest region,
    particularly in our Phoenix market, and in our West region,
    particularly in our Northern California market.

Home
    Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales decreased 42%, to $3,563.6 million
    (16,703 homes closed) in 2009 from $6,164.3 million (26,396
    homes closed) in 2008. The average selling price of homes closed
    during 2009 was $213,400, down 9% from the $233,500 average in
    2008. In fiscal 2009, home sales revenues decreased
    significantly in all of our market regions, reflecting the
    continued weak demand and resulting decline in net sales order
    volume and pricing experienced during the year. The number of
    homes closed in 2009 decreased 37% due to decreases in all of
    our market regions.

Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were increased
    by $3.1 million and $26.8 million, respectively, from
    changes in deferred profit. As of September 30, 2009, the
    balance of deferred profit was $2.7 million, compared to
    $5.8 million at September 30, 2008.

Home
    Sales Gross Profit

Gross profit from home sales decreased by 32%, to
    $467.5 million in 2009, from $691.2 million in 2008,
    and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, increased
    190 basis points, to 13.1%. Approximately 230 basis
    points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage
    was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more
    than our average selling prices, caused by a greater portion of
    our closings occurring in our South Central region, which had
    experienced more stable housing conditions than our other
    regions, and the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes
    closed during fiscal 2009. Approximately 50 basis points of
    the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of
    capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes
    sales revenues resulting from reductions in our interest and
    property taxes incurred over fiscal 2009. These increases were
    partially offset by a decrease of 30 basis points due to
    the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross
    profit during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and by
    60 basis points due to an increase in actual and estimated
    warranty and construction defect costs. The increase in
    estimated warranty costs was due in part to a fiscal 2009
    adjustment to our estimated warranty liability related to
    estimated costs to remedy homes which we had found to or
    suspected might contain allegedly defective drywall manufactured
    in China (Chinese Drywall) in two of our markets. Also, we
    experienced increases in our construction defect claims
    self-insured retentions, resulting in additional reserves for
    estimated claims.

Land
    Sales Revenue

Land sales revenues decreased 89% to $40.3 million in 2009,
    from $354.3 million in 2008. Of the $40.3 million of
    revenues in fiscal 2009, $26.9 million related to land sale
    transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which
    recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of
    the sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold a
    significant amount of land and lots through numerous
    transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying
    costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory
    supply in certain markets. Consummating these transactions
    during fiscal 2008 allowed us to monetize a large portion of our
    deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006
    resulting in a substantial tax refund.

A community may consist of land
    held for development, residential land and lots developed and
    under development, and construction in progress and finished
    homes. A particular community often includes inventory in more
    than one category. Further, a community may contain multiple
    parcels with varying product types (e.g. entry level and

move-up

single family detached, as well as attached product types). Some
    communities have no homes under construction, finished homes, or
    current home sales efforts or activity.



Inventory
    Impairments and Land Option Cost Write-offs

During fiscal 2009, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized reflected our
    cautious outlook for the broader homebuilding industry and our
    markets, both of which impact our business. This outlook
    incorporated our belief that housing market conditions might
    continue to deteriorate, and that challenging conditions would
    persist. Our impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2009
    occurred after the end of the spring/summer selling season and
    was based on our latest operating plans for our projects into
    fiscal 2010, and reflected the anticipated expiration of
    government support efforts for the homebuilding industry, such
    as the tax credit and Fed purchases of mortgage-backed
    securities, in the subsequent year. Accordingly, our impairment
    evaluation as of September 30, 2009 again indicated a
    significant number of communities with impairment indicators.
    Communities with a combined carrying value of
    $963.1 million as of September 30, 2009, had
    indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for
    impairment. Through this evaluation process, we determined that
    communities with a carrying value of $421.3 million as of
    September 30, 2009, the largest portion of which was in the
    West region, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded impairment charges of
    $174.9 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired
    communities to their estimated fair value, as compared to
    $988.9 million in the same period of the prior year. The
    fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded
    earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment
    charges of $377.8 million and $2,372.6 million during
    fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. In performing our quarterly
    inventory impairment analyses during fiscal 2009, we utilized a
    range of discount rates for communities of 14% to 20% which was
    increased from the range of 12% to 18% we would have used for
    these communities in fiscal 2008. The increased discount rates
    reflected our estimate of the increased level of market risk
    present in the homebuilding and related mortgage lending
    industries. The impact of the increase in the discount rates on
    the fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 inventory impairment charges
    was an increase of $9.9 million and $18.9 million,
    respectively. During fiscal 2009, approximately 85% of the
    impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots
    and land held for development, and approximately 15% of the
    charges were recorded to construction in progress and finished
    homes inventory, compared to 79% and 21%, respectively, in
    fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we wrote off $29.9 million and
    $111.9 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to option contracts for land or
    lots which are not expected to be acquired. The inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as
    a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately
    1,130 basis points in fiscal 2009, compared to
    3,810 basis points in the fiscal 2008.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities decreased by
    $268.8 million, or 34%, to $523.0 million in 2009 from
    $791.8 million in 2008. As homebuilding revenues declined
    at a faster pace than SG&A expense, when expressed as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense increased
    240 basis points, to 14.5% in 2009 from 12.1% in 2008. The
    largest component of our homebuilding SG&A expense is
    employee compensation and related costs, which represented 55%
    and 52% of SG&A costs in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    costs decreased $125.7 million, or 30%, to
    $287.2 million in 2009 from $412.9 million in 2008.
    This decrease was largely due to our efforts to align the number
    of employees to match our home closing levels, as well as a
    decrease in incentive compensation. Our homebuilding operations
    employed approximately 2,300 and 3,100 employees at
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Most other
    SG&A cost components also decreased in fiscal 2009 as
    compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of our efforts to reduce
    all costs throughout the company. The most substantial decreases
    occurred in advertising and depreciation.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during
    active development and construction. Due to our inventory
    reduction strategies and slowing or suspending land development
    in certain communities, our active inventory during fiscal 2009
    and 2008 was lower than our debt level; therefore, a portion of
    our interest incurred was expensed. We expensed
    $100.2 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2009,
    compared to $39.0 million of interest during fiscal 2008
    since the ratio of our active inventory to debt declined during
    that period.



Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written
    off with inventory impairment charges, was 3.9% of total home
    and land/lot cost of sales in both 2009 and 2008. Interest
    incurred is related to the average level of our homebuilding
    debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2009 with
    fiscal 2008, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt
    decreased 13% to $205.0 million, primarily due to a 13%
    decrease in our average homebuilding debt.

Gain/Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

During fiscal 2009, in addition to repaying maturing senior
    notes, we repurchased a total of $380.3 million principal
    amount of various issues of our senior notes prior to their
    maturity for an aggregate purchase price of $368.0 million,
    plus accrued interest. We recognized a gain of
    $11.5 million related to these repurchases, which was
    partially offset by a loss of $7.6 million related to the
    early termination of our revolving credit facility in May 2009.
    These transactions resulted in a net gain of $3.9 million
    during fiscal 2009.

The loss on early retirement of debt of $2.6 million during
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized
    fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit
    facility in June 2008.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $12.8 million in 2009, compared
    to $9.1 million in 2008. The largest component of other
    income in both years was interest income.

Goodwill

In performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of
    September 30, 2009, we determined that our goodwill balance
    of $15.9 million, all of which relates to our South Central
    reporting segment, was not impaired. As a result of the analysis
    performed as of September 30, 2008, we recorded a goodwill
    impairment charge of $79.4 million, all of which related to
    our Southwest reporting segment.

Expenses maintained at the
    corporate level consist primarily of interest and property
    taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or
    expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our
    corporate office. The amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the
    segment’s revenue, while the interest expensed directly and
    those expenses associated with the corporate office are
    allocated to each segment based on the segment’s average
    inventory.

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    41% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 37% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, with the largest decreases in our
    New Jersey and Carolina markets. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $95.9 million in 2009, compared to a
    loss of $332.5 million in 2008. The losses were due in part
    to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and



pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $64.9 million and
    $288.4 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    390 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008.
    The increase was a result of the average cost of our homes
    declining by more than the average selling prices due to the
    effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed during
    2009.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 42% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 40%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, with the largest
    decreases in our Denver market. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $104.9 million in 2009, compared to
    a loss of $184.3 million in 2008. The losses were due in
    part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost

write-offs

totaling $54.7 million and $163.3 million in fiscal
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The region’s home sales gross
    profit percentage decreased 540 basis points in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was a result of lower
    margins in our Chicago and Denver markets, as well as higher
    warranty costs on previously closed homes in our Denver market.
    Additionally, our revenues declined at a greater rate than our
    SG&A expenses, which also contributed to the loss before
    income taxes in 2009.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 30% in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to a 20%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 12%
    decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region
    reported a loss before income taxes of $73.2 million in
    2009, compared to a loss of $507.7 million in 2008. The
    losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and
    earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $38.0 million and $457.5 million in fiscal 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage increased 340 basis points in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was a result of the
    average cost of our homes declining by more than the average
    selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments
    on homes closed during 2009, and was partially offset by
    estimated warranty costs related to homes in one market in
    Florida which we had found to or suspected may contain Chinese
    Drywall.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 30% in 2009 compared to 2008, due to a 28% decrease in
    the number of homes closed. The region reported income before
    income taxes of $4.9 million in fiscal 2009, compared to a
    loss before income taxes of $6.1 million in fiscal 2008.
    The improvement was due in part to a decrease in inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs, which were $20.0 million and $72.4 million
    in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The region’s home
    sales gross profit percentage increased 40 basis points in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to the effects of prior
    inventory impairments on homes closed during 2009. These
    improvements were partially offset by our SG&A expenses
    decreasing at a slower rate, 22%, than our homebuilding revenues.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 67% in 2009 compared to 2008, due to a 61% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, primarily in our Phoenix market, as
    well as decreases in the average selling price of homes in the
    region. The region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $45.8 million in 2009, compared to a loss of
    $369.6 million in 2008. The losses were due in part to
    inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $39.4 million and
    $330.7 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. In
    fiscal 2008, goodwill impairment charges of $79.4 million
    also contributed to the loss. The region’s revenues
    declined at a greater rate than its SG&A expenses, which
    also contributed to the loss before income taxes in 2009. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    110 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due
    to the effects of prior inventory impairments on homes closed
    during 2009.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    50% in 2009 compared to 2008, due to a 37% decrease in the
    number of homes closed, as well as a 14% decrease in the average
    selling price of those homes. The largest decreases in homes
    closed occurred in our Northern California markets. The region
    reported a loss before income taxes of $226.4 million in
    2009, compared to a loss of $1.3 billion in 2008. The
    losses were due in part to inventory impairment charges and
    earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $190.7 million and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage increased 450 basis points in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was a result of the
    average cost of our homes declining by more than the average
    selling prices due to the effects of prior inventory impairments
    on homes closed during 2009.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage
    operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by
    our homebuilding operations. Total first-lien loans originated
    or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 14%
    in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, corresponding to the 25%
    increase in the number of homes closed. The percentage increase
    in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in
    the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations due to
    a decrease in our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total
    home closings by our homebuilding operations for which DHI
    Mortgage handled the homebuyers’ financing), to 61% in
    2010, from 67% in 2009.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 90%
    of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2010, compared to 83% in
    2009, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The relatively higher captive percentage in the
    current year reflects a lower level of refinancing activity than
    in the prior year.

The number of loans sold to third-party purchasers was virtually
    the same in 2010 as compared to 2009, while the number of loans
    originated increased by 5%. Loans are typically sold within
    30 days of origination. Fluctuations in the volume of loans
    sold for a given period may not correspond to the change in loan
    origination volume because of the timing of loan sales, which
    for any quarter generally represents the loans originated in the
    last month of the prior quarter plus the first two months of the
    current quarter. Virtually all of the mortgage loans originated
    during fiscal 2010 and mortgage loans held for sale on
    September 30, 2010 were eligible for sale to Fannie Mae,
    Freddie Mac or GNMA (“Agency-eligible”). Approximately
    86% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage during fiscal
    2010 were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to
    their loan purchase agreements with DHI Mortgage. If we are
    unable to sell our mortgages to these or other purchasers, our
    ability to originate and sell mortgage loans could be
    significantly reduced and the profitability of our financial
    services operations would be negatively impacted.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment increased 69%, to
    $90.5 million in 2010 from $53.7 million in 2009. Loan
    origination fees decreased 5%, to $17.7 million in 2010
    from $18.6 million in 2009, while the number of loans
    originated increased 5% during the same period. The decrease in
    loan origination fees during 2010 relates to the adoption of the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) authoritative
    guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial
    instruments on October 1, 2008. The authoritative guidance
    requires net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage
    loans to be recognized at origination and no longer deferred
    until the time of sale. Therefore, during fiscal 2009, we
    recognized $2.4 million of loan origination fees and
    $5.0 million of general and administrative (G&A) costs
    related to prior period loan originations. Revenues from the
    sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages
    increased 5%, to $59.6 million in 2010, from
    $56.8 million in 2009. Charges related to recourse
    obligations were $13.7 million in fiscal 2010, compared to
    $33.2 million in fiscal 2009. The calculation of our
    required repurchase loss reserve is based upon an analysis of
    repurchase requests received, our actual repurchases and losses
    through the disposition of such loans, discussions with our
    mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated.
    While we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on
    known and projected repurchase requests, if either actual
    repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases
    exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be
    incurred. Also, a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of
    private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by DHI
    Mortgage in prior years. Charges to increase reserves for
    expected losses on the reinsured loans were $1.9 million
    and $14.9 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Financial services G&A expense decreased 1%, to
    $77.2 million in 2010 from $78.1 million in 2009, but
    increased 6% when excluding $5.0 million of compensation
    costs recognized in fiscal 2009 upon the adoption of the
    FASB’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements
    as discussed above. The largest component of our financial
    services G&A expense is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 78% and 75% of G&A costs in 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Excluding the $5.0 million
    adjustment discussed



above, these costs increased 14%, to $60.5 million in 2010
    from $53.3 million in 2009. The increase in the current
    year relates to an increase in the number of financial services
    employees to approximately 700 at September 30, 2010, from
    600 at September 30, 2009 to support our increased volume
    and more stringent mortgage purchaser underwriting guidelines.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, excluding the
    effects of recourse and reinsurance expense, G&A expense
    decreased to 72.8% in 2010, from 76.7% in 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to the adoption in 2009 of the FASB’s
    authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain
    financial instruments as discussed above, partially offset by
    additional costs incurred to support more stringent mortgage
    purchaser underwriting guidelines. Fluctuations in financial
    services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can be
    expected to occur as some expenses are not directly related to
    mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue
    earned.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

Total first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage
    for our homebuyers decreased by 31% in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008, corresponding to the 37% decrease in the number of
    homes closed. The percentage decrease in loans originated was
    lower than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to an
    increase in our mortgage capture rate to 67% in 2009, from 61%
    in 2008.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 83%
    of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2009, compared to 92% in
    2008, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The relatively lower captive percentage in 2009
    reflects an increase in refinancing activity as existing
    homeowners took advantage of the decline in mortgage interest
    rates.

The number of loans sold to third-party purchasers decreased by
    22% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due
    to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated.
    Consistent with fiscal 2008, originations during fiscal 2009
    continued to predominantly be Agency-eligible. In fiscal 2009,
    approximately 99% of DHI Mortgage production and 98% of mortgage
    loans held for sale on September 30, 2009 were
    Agency-eligible.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 58%, to
    $53.7 million in 2009 from $127.5 million in 2008. The
    decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of
    mortgage loans originated and sold, as well as an increase in
    recourse expense related to future loan repurchase obligations
    and increases in the loss reserves for reinsured loans. Charges
    related to recourse obligations were $33.2 million in
    fiscal 2009, compared to $21.9 million in fiscal 2008. The
    increase in recourse expense is a result of increasing our loan
    loss reserves during fiscal 2009 due to increased expectations
    for loan repurchases and related losses caused by additional
    repurchase requests arising under the limited recourse
    provisions. Also, a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of
    private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by DHI
    Mortgage in prior years. Charges to increase reserves for
    expected losses on the reinsured loans were $14.9 million
    and $4.9 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Additionally, revenues during fiscal 2008 included the
    recognition of an additional $8.8 million of revenues
    related to the adoption of the FASB’s authoritative
    guidance for written loan commitments which was adopted on
    January 1, 2008. The guidance requires that the expected
    net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a
    loan are included in the measurement of all written loan
    commitments that are accounted for at fair value through
    earnings at the time of commitment. The effect of this guidance
    in fiscal 2009 was a $4.3 million decrease in revenues.

Financial services G&A expense decreased 22%, to
    $78.1 million in 2009 from $100.1 million in 2008. The
    largest component of our financial services G&A expense is
    employee compensation and related costs, which represented 75%
    and 71% of G&A costs in 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    costs decreased 18%, to $58.3 million in 2009 from
    $70.8 million in 2008, as we have continued to align the
    number of employees with current and anticipated loan
    origination and title service levels. Our financial services
    operations employed approximately 600 and 700 employees at
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, excluding the
    effects of recourse and reinsurance expense, G&A expense
    increased to 76.7% in 2009, from 64.9% in 2008. The increase was
    primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the
    decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2009, as well as
    higher revenues in the prior year due to the adoption of the
    authoritative guidance for written loan commitments.



Results
    of Operations — Consolidated

Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended
    September 30, 2009

Income
    (Loss) before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 was
    $99.5 million, compared to a loss before income taxes of
    $556.8 million for fiscal 2009. The difference in our
    operating results for 2010 compared to a year ago is primarily
    due to increased revenue from the higher volume of homes closed,
    a higher gross profit from home sales revenues and lower
    inventory impairment charges.

Income
    Taxes

The benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2010 was
    $145.6 million, compared to a benefit of $7.0 million
    in 2009. In November 2009, the Worker, Homeownership, and
    Business Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted into law and amended
    Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. This tax law
    change allows a net operating loss (NOL) realized in one of our
    fiscal 2008, 2009 or 2010 years to be carried back up to
    five years (previously limited to a two-year carryback). We
    elected to carry back our fiscal 2009 NOL. This resulted in a
    benefit from income taxes of $208.3 million during fiscal
    2010, which was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized
    tax benefits and state income tax expense. We do not have
    meaningful effective tax rates in these years because of the
    valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets.

We had income taxes receivable of $16.0 million and
    $293.1 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. During fiscal 2010, we received income tax refunds
    totaling $487.1 million, which resulted from tax losses
    generated in fiscal 2008 and 2009. The income taxes receivable
    at September 30, 2010 relate to additional federal and
    state income tax refunds we expect to receive.

At September 30, 2010, we had a federal NOL carryforward of
    $285.8 million that will expire in fiscal 2030 and tax
    benefits for state NOL carryforwards of $83.5 million that
    expire (beginning at various times depending on the tax
    jurisdiction) from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2030.

At September 30, 2010 and 2009, we had net deferred income
    tax assets of $902.6 million and $1,073.9 million,
    respectively, offset by valuation allowances of
    $902.6 million and $1,073.9 million, respectively. The
    future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately
    depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in our
    carryforward periods under the tax laws. We continue to analyze
    the positive and negative evidence in determining the expected
    realization of our deferred income tax assets. The accounting
    for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results.
    Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these
    future tax consequences could have a material impact on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.
    Changes in existing tax laws also affect actual tax results and
    the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.

The benefits of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards, as well as
    our unrealized built-in losses, would be reduced or potentially
    eliminated if we experienced an ownership change as defined by
    Internal Revenue Code Section 382. We do not believe we
    have experienced such an ownership change as of
    September 30, 2010; however, the amount by which our
    ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and
    sales of stock by 5% stockholders; the potential conversion of
    our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to
    whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially
    in stock; and new issuances of stock by us.

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between a tax
    position taken, or expected to be taken in a tax return, and the
    benefit recognized for accounting purposes. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits (which includes interest, penalties,
    and the tax benefit relating to the deductibility of interest
    and state income taxes) was $82.8 million and
    $24.0 million as of September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. All tax positions, if recognized, would affect our
    effective income tax rate. The increase in unrecognized tax
    benefits resulted in large part from our election to carryback
    our fiscal 2009 NOL to fiscal 2004 and 2005, thereby changing
    the reserve needed for all years open to further tax assessment
    including 2004 and 2005. It is reasonably possible that, within
    the next 12 months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
    may decrease as much as



$59.2 million as a result of a ruling request filed by us
    with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning
    capitalization of inventory costs. If the IRS rules favorably on
    the ruling request, our unrecognized tax benefits would be
    reduced, resulting in a benefit from income taxes in the
    consolidated statement of operations.

We classify interest and penalties on income taxes as income tax
    expense. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recognized interest and
    penalties with respect to income taxes of $11.7 million and
    $3.0 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements
    of operations, and at September 30, 2010 and 2009, our
    total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized
    income tax benefits was $17.8 million and
    $6.2 million, respectively.

We are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in
    multiple states. The statute of limitations for our major tax
    jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004
    through 2010. We are currently being audited by various states
    and our federal NOL refunds from fiscal 2008 and 2009 are
    subject to Congressional Joint Committee review.

Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended
    September 30, 2008

Loss
    before Income Taxes

Loss before income taxes for fiscal 2009 was
    $556.8 million, compared to $2,631.8 million for
    fiscal 2008. The decrease in our consolidated loss was primarily
    due to significantly lower inventory impairment charges during
    fiscal 2009, as well as a decrease in our SG&A expense.
    These improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in the
    amount of our home sales gross profit due to a reduction in
    revenues.

Income
    Taxes

In fiscal 2009, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of
    $7.0 million, which relates primarily to adjustments to the
    tax provision recorded for fiscal year 2008 resulting from the
    finalization and filing of the tax return for that year. In
    fiscal 2008, we recorded a provision for income taxes of
    $1.8 million. We do not have meaningful effective tax rates
    in these years because of losses from operations before taxes,
    the impact of valuation allowances on our net deferred tax
    assets and impairment of nondeductible goodwill.

We had income tax receivables of $293.1 million and
    $676.2 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. In December 2008, we received a federal income tax
    refund of $621.7 million with respect to our
    2008 year. We received $113.0 million of the
    $293.1 million receivable in the form of a tax refund
    during October 2009. A substantial portion of the remaining tax
    receivable at September 30, 2009 was due to the carryback
    of federal tax losses generated in fiscal 2009 that can be
    carried back against fiscal 2007 taxable income. We also had
    $11.1 million of income tax receivables for state operating
    loss carrybacks at September 30, 2009. At
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, we had net deferred tax assets
    of $1,073.9 million and $1,174.8 million,
    respectively, offset by valuation allowances of
    $1,073.9 million and $961.3 million, respectively.

During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we recognized interest and
    penalties with respect to income taxes of $3.0 million and
    $4.0 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements
    of operations, and at September 30, 2009 and 2008, our
    total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized
    income tax benefits was $6.2 million and $4.9 million,
    respectively. As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, our total
    unrecognized income tax benefits were $24.0 million and
    $18.7 million, respectively.

Overview
    of Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial
    services operations with cash flows from operating activities,
    borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of
    new debt securities. During the challenging homebuilding market
    conditions experienced over the past few years, we have been
    operating with a primary focus to generate cash flows through
    reductions in assets, as well as through profitable operations.
    Our cash generation has also benefitted from income tax refunds.
    The generation of cash flow has allowed us to increase our
    liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet, and has placed us in
    a position to be able to invest in market opportunities as they
    arise. We do not expect to generate as much cash from asset



reductions in fiscal 2011 as we have in any of the past four
    fiscal years. Depending upon future homebuilding market
    conditions and our expectations for these conditions, we may use
    a portion of our cash balances to increase our operating assets.
    We intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet
    strength, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to
    access the capital markets as they become available.

At September 30, 2010, our ratio of net homebuilding debt
    to total capital was 16.1%, a decrease of 1,640 basis
    points from 32.5% at September 30, 2009. Net homebuilding
    debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net
    of cash and marketable securities divided by total capital net
    of cash and marketable securities (homebuilding notes payable
    net of cash and marketable securities plus total equity). The
    decrease in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital
    at September 30, 2010 as compared to the ratio a year
    earlier was primarily due to our lower debt balance resulting
    from redemptions and repurchases of senior and senior
    subordinated notes, income tax refunds and net income for the
    year. Our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital
    remains well within our target operating range of below 45%. We
    believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity position
    will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market
    conditions. However, future period-end net homebuilding debt to
    total capital ratios may be higher than the 16.1% ratio achieved
    at September 30, 2010.

We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our
    homebuilding operations and comparing us with other
    homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services
    business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation
    under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized
    and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our
    homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we
    include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a
    reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. For
    comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital
    above, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital, without
    netting cash and marketable securities balances, were 44.3% and
    56.2% at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We believe that we will be able to fund our near-term working
    capital needs and debt obligations from existing cash resources
    and our mortgage repurchase facility. For our longer-term
    capital requirements, we will evaluate the need to issue new
    debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or
    obtain additional bank financing as market conditions may permit.

Homebuilding
    Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2010, we had available homebuilding cash and
    cash equivalents of $1.3 billion.

Marketable Securities

— At September 30,
    2010, we had marketable securities of $297.7 million. Our
    marketable securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities,
    government agency securities, foreign government securities,
    corporate debt securities, and certificates of deposit.

Secured Letter of Credit Agreements

—
    Concurrent with the termination of our revolving credit facility
    in May 2009, we entered into secured letter of credit agreements
    with the three banks that had issued letters of credit under the
    facility. The effect of these agreements was to remove the
    outstanding letters of credit from the facility, which required
    us to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the balance of
    letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing
    banks. During fiscal 2010, we entered into secured letter of
    credit agreements with two additional banks, which also require
    the deposit of cash as collateral. At September 30, 2010
    and 2009, the amount of cash restricted for this purpose totaled
    $52.6 million and $53.3 million, respectively, and is
    included in homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated
    balance sheets.

Public Unsecured Debt

— The indentures
    governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation
    of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2010, we were
    in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that
    form a part of the public debt obligations.

Shelf Registration Statement

— We have an
    effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the
    SEC in September 2009, registering debt and equity securities
    which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined.



Financial
    Services Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2010, the amount of financial services cash
    and cash equivalents was $26.7 million.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility

— Our mortgage
    subsidiary entered into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement
    (the “mortgage repurchase facility”) on March 28,
    2008. The mortgage repurchase facility, which is accounted for
    as a secured financing, provides financing and liquidity to DHI
    Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI
    Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against
    the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming
    purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
    to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party
    purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time
    frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of
    the mortgage repurchase facility. The capacity of the facility
    is $100 million, with a provision allowing an increase in
    the capacity to $125 million during the last five business
    days of any fiscal quarter and the first seven business days of
    the following fiscal quarter. The maturity date of the facility
    is March 4, 2011.

As of September 30, 2010, $236.9 million of mortgage
    loans held for sale were pledged under the repurchase agreement.
    These mortgage loans had a collateral value of
    $222.7 million. DHI Mortgage has the option to fund a
    portion of its repurchase obligations in advance. As a result of
    advance paydowns totaling $136.2 million, DHI Mortgage had
    an obligation of $86.5 million outstanding under the
    mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2010 at a
    3.8% interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our
    homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as
    to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net
    worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth
    and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured
    and reported monthly. At September 30, 2010, our mortgage
    subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions and
    covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage
    credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their
    maturities, and obtain temporary additional commitments through
    amendments to the credit agreements during periods of higher
    than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of
    our financial services business depends upon its continued
    ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or
    to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.

Operating
    Cash Flow Activities

During fiscal 2010, net cash provided by our operating
    activities was $709.4 million, compared to
    $1.1 billion during fiscal 2009. A significant portion of
    the net cash provided by our operating activities during these
    years was due to federal income tax refunds. In fiscal 2010, the
    profit we generated also contributed to operating cash flows. In
    addition, during fiscal 2009 and particularly during fiscal
    2008, a significant portion of the net cash provided by our
    operating activities was due to the generation of cash flows
    through the reduction of our inventories. The net cash provided
    by our operating activities during the past three fiscal years
    has resulted in substantial liquidity. This liquidity gives us
    the flexibility to determine the appropriate operating strategy
    for each of our communities and to take advantage of
    opportunities in the market. While we have limited our purchases
    of undeveloped land and our development spending on land we own,
    we are purchasing or contracting to purchase finished lots in
    many markets to potentially increase sales and home closing
    volumes and return to sustainable profitability. We plan to
    continue to manage our inventories by monitoring the number and
    aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold,
    completed homes in inventory. As we work toward these goals, we
    expect to generate less cash flow from asset reductions than we
    have over the past three fiscal years. Depending upon future
    homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these
    conditions, we may use a portion of our cash balances to
    increase our inventories.



Investing
    Cash Flow Activities

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, net cash used in our investing
    activities was $318.0 million and $59.4 million,
    respectively. In fiscal 2010, we began to invest a portion of
    our cash on hand in marketable securities and we used
    $328.0 million for this purpose. Proceeds from the sale of
    these marketable securities during the year totaled
    $27.7 million. Additionally, in fiscal 2010 and 2009 we
    used $19.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively, to
    invest in purchases of property and equipment, primarily model
    home furniture and office equipment. In fiscal 2009, the
    increase in restricted cash was due to the initial cash
    collateralization of our outstanding letters of credit under the
    terms of our secured letter of credit agreements. Subsequent
    changes in restricted cash are primarily due to fluctuations in
    the balance of our outstanding letters of credit.

Financing
    Cash Flow Activities

During the last two years, the majority of our short-term
    financing needs have been funded with cash generated from
    operations and borrowings available under our financial services
    credit facility. Long-term financing needs of our homebuilding
    operations have historically been funded with the issuance of
    senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital
    markets. During fiscal 2010, we repaid a total of
    $1,016.3 million principal amount of various issues of
    senior and senior subordinated notes through maturities,
    redemptions and repurchases for an aggregate purchase price of
    $1,018.2 million, plus accrued interest. During fiscal
    2009, we repaid a total of $833.2 million principal amount
    of various issues of senior notes through maturities and
    repurchases for an aggregate purchase price of
    $821.0 million, plus accrued interest. Also, during fiscal
    2009, we issued $500 million principal amount of 2%
    convertible senior notes due 2014. Our homebuilding senior and
    convertible senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of
    our wholly-owned subsidiaries other than our financial services
    subsidiaries and certain insignificant subsidiaries.

Consistent with dividends paid in fiscal 2009, our Board of
    Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of $0.0375 per
    common share during fiscal 2010. The last of these was paid on
    August 26, 2010 to stockholders of record on
    August 16, 2010. On November 11, 2010, our Board of
    Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.0375 per common share,
    payable on December 8, 2010, to stockholders of record on
    November 24, 2010. The declaration of future cash dividends
    is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
    upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital
    requirements, our financial condition and general business
    conditions.

Changes
    in Capital Structure

In November 2009, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock and
    the repurchase of up to $500 million of our debt
    securities. Following significant repurchase activity, the debt
    repurchase authorization was renewed in April 2010 and again in
    July 2010. The current authorization is effective through
    July 31, 2011. At September 30, 2010,
    $483.8 million of the authorization was remaining.

On January 15, 2010, we repaid the remaining
    $130.9 million principal amount of our 4.875% senior
    notes which were due on that date. On February 24, 2010, we
    redeemed the remaining $95.0 million principal amount of
    our 5.875% senior notes due 2013. On September 15,
    2010, we repaid the remaining $51.9 million principal
    amount of our 9.75% senior notes and $11.3 million
    principal amount of our 9.75% senior subordinated notes due
    on that date. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, we repurchased a
    total of $727.2 million principal amount of various issues
    of senior notes through unsolicited transactions. These
    repayments of public unsecured debt were made from our cash
    balance.

In October 2010, through an unsolicited transaction, we
    repurchased $8.3 million principal amount of our
    5.375% senior notes due 2012.

Recently, our primary non-operating use of available capital has
    been to repay debt. We continue to evaluate our alternatives for
    future non-operating sources and uses of our available capital,
    including debt repayments, dividend payments or common stock
    repurchases, while considering the overall level of our cash
    balances within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage
    targets and our liquidity targets.



Contractual
    Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding
    and financial services segments are payments under our debt
    agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase
    obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific
    performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements
    that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land
    seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our
    contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business
    through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows
    generated from operations, renewed or amended mortgage
    repurchase facilities and, if needed or believed advantageous,
    the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public
    capital markets as market conditions may permit.

Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of
    September 30, 2010 are presented below:

Financial services notes payable
    represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage
    subsidiary’s repurchase facility. The interest obligation
    associated with this variable rate facility is based on its
    effective rate of 3.8% and principal balance outstanding at
    September 30, 2010.

At September 30, 2010, our homebuilding operations had
    outstanding letters of credit of $51.7 million, all of
    which were cash collateralized, and surety bonds of
    $806.9 million, issued by third parties, to secure
    performance under various contracts. We expect that our
    performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and
    bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of
    business and in accordance with the applicable contractual
    terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related
    letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly
    thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have
    no material third-party guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related
    to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk” under Part II of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot
    option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the
    construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control
    significant lot positions with limited capital investment and
    substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership
    and development. Within the land and lot option purchase
    contracts at September 30, 2010, there were a limited
    number of contracts, representing $5.7 million of remaining
    purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which
    may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land
    sellers meeting their obligations. Also, we consolidated certain
    variable interest entities for which we are deemed to be the
    primary beneficiary, with



assets of $7.6 million related to some of our outstanding
    land and lot option purchase contracts. Creditors, if any, of
    these variable interest entities have no recourse against us.
    Further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in
    the “Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory”
    section included herein.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Prior to
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, we generally
    had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had
    greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased
    our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations
    during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our
    funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our
    financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a
    result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations
    and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter
    are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal
    year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, the weakness in
    homebuilding market conditions during the past four years has
    mitigated our historical seasonal variations. Also, in fiscal
    2010 the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit impacted
    the timing of our construction activities, home sales and
    closing volumes. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

Inflation

We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely
    affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of
    higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs.
    In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly
    affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to
    prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our
    customers any increases in our costs through increased sales
    prices. However, during periods of soft housing market
    conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases with
    higher selling prices.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in
    other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC,
    statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral

Critical
    Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the
    significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying
    financial statements as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and
    for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Each
    of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current
    authoritative literature that collectively comprises
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In
    instances where alternative methods of accounting are
    permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most
    appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results
    of our operations and our financial condition, and have
    consistently applied those methods over each of the periods
    presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting
    policies selected.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize
    homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the
    closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property
    are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the
    buyer’s financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our
    wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an
    adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit is
    deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a
    third-party purchaser has been completed. Any profit on land
    sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are
    met. We include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit
    at title companies in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales
    contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance
    payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options
    related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as
    liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are
    canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits
    on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable
    provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our
    title operations as closing services are rendered and title
    insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur
    simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially
    all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies
    to third-party insurers. In accordance with the FASB’s
    authoritative guidance related to the fair value option for
    financial



assets, we typically elect the fair value option for our
    mortgage loan originations. Mortgage loans held for sale are
    initially recorded at fair value based on either sale
    commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for
    subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold. The
    fair value option alleviates the complex documentation required
    had these instruments been designated as a fair value hedge. Net
    origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are
    recognized at the time of origination. The expected net future
    cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are
    included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that
    are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of
    commitment. We generally do not retain or service the mortgages
    that we originate; rather, we seek to sell the mortgages and
    related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest
    income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated
    until the loan is sold.

Some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions.
    Based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage
    purchasers, analysis of the mortgages we originated and current
    housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a
    loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage
    loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage
    loan repurchase requests. A 20% or 40% increase in the amount of
    expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on
    mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of
    approximately $4.5 million or $9.7 million,
    respectively, in our reserve for expected mortgage loan
    repurchases.

Marketable Securities

— During fiscal 2010, we
    began to invest a portion of our cash on hand by purchasing
    marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months.
    These securities are held in the custody of a single financial
    institution. To be considered for investment, securities must
    meet certain minimum requirements as to their credit ratings,
    time to maturity and other risk-related criteria as prescribed
    by our investment policies. The primary objective of these
    investments is the preservation of capital, with the secondary
    objectives of attaining higher yields than we earn on our cash
    and cash equivalents and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.

We consider our investment portfolio to be

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value. At
    the end of a reporting period, unrealized gains and losses on
    these investments, net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory
    includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development
    and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes
    and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home
    construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur
    after development projects or homes are substantially complete,
    such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such
    as compensation of sales personnel, division and region
    management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk
    insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. We use the specific
    identification method for the purpose of accumulating home
    construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the
    specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are allocated on a pro-rata basis
    to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant
    development activity, which generally relates to the remaining
    homes in the community.

When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and
    recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. We
    record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the
    amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed
    homes that have been closed. We compare our home construction
    budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional
    costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the
    accuracy of the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on
    closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously
    accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on
    previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals,
    differences in amounts historically have not been significant.



Each quarter, we review our inventory for the purpose of
    determining whether recorded costs and any estimated costs
    required to complete each home or community are recoverable. If
    the review indicates that an impairment loss is required, an
    estimate of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in
    that quarter.

Land inventory and related communities under development are
    reviewed for potential write-downs when impairment indicators
    are present. We generally review our inventory at the community
    level and the inventory within each community may be categorized
    as land held for development, residential land and lots
    developed and under development, and construction in progress
    and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans
    for future development. A particular community often includes
    inventory in more than one category. In certain situations,
    inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes
    based on its product type (e.g. single family homes evaluated
    separately from condominium parcels). In reviewing each of our
    communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on
    inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors
    including, but not limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we
    perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their
    carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are required to
    be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their
    carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are
    significantly impacted by community specific factors including
    estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and
    estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor
    costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local
    market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of our communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;

•

alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of
    land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;

•

amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market
    or

sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our
    determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting
    the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the
    inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
    cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is
    determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the
    community in the same manner as land and development costs are
    allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is
    categorized as construction in progress and finished homes,
    residential land and lots developed and under development, and
    land held for development, based on the stage of production or
    plans for future development.

We typically do not purchase land for resale. However, when we
    own land or communities under development that no longer fit
    into our development and construction plans and we determine
    that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset, the
    project is accounted for as land held for sale, assuming the
    land held for sale criteria are met. We record land held for
    sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less



estimated costs to sell. In performing impairment evaluation for
    land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but
    not limited to, prices for land in recent comparable sales
    transactions, market analysis studies, which include the
    estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and
    recent legitimate offers received. If the estimated fair value
    less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying
    value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
    less costs to sell.

Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in
    substantially completed communities when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair
    values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. Our quarterly assessments reflect management’s
    estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of

held-for-sale

assets through the disposition date.

Land and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

— In the
    ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter into land
    and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for
    the construction of homes. Under these contracts, we will fund a
    stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the
    obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time
    with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase
    contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our
    discretion.

Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs we incur related to
    our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if
    all of the following conditions have been met: (1) the
    costs are directly identifiable with the specific property;
    (2) the costs would be capitalized if the property were
    already acquired; and (3) acquisition of the property is
    probable, meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability
    to acquire the property, and there is no indication that the
    property is not available for sale. We also consider the
    following when determining if the acquisition of the property is
    probable: (1) changes in market conditions subsequent to
    contracting for the purchase of the land; (2) current
    contract terms, including per lot price and required purchase
    dates; and (3) our current land position in the given
    market or

sub-market.

Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are
    expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we
    will no longer acquire the land or lots under option and will
    not be able to recover these costs through other means.

We evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts for the
    financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain
    variable interest entities, which are defined as business
    entities that either have equity investors with voting rights
    disproportionate to their ownership interests, or have equity
    investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
    the entities to support their activities. Certain of our option
    purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest
    in the entity holding the land parcel under option. We evaluate
    those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable
    interest entities to determine whether we are the primary
    beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the
    expected gains and losses of the entity. The expected gains and
    losses are primarily determined by the amount of deposit
    required by the contract, the time period or term of the
    contract, and by analyzing the volatility in home sales prices
    as well as development and entitlement risk in each specific
    market. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary
    beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land
    or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is
    consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in these
    unaffiliated variable interest entities, we generally have
    little or no control or influence over the operations of these
    entities or their owners. When our requests for financial
    information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions
    about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required.
    In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated
    entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual
    purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these
    cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations
    and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the
    option to buy with a related offset to noncontrolling interest
    for the assumed third-party investment in the variable interest
    entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities
    have no recourse against us.

Fair Value Measurements

— We adopted the
    FASB’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements
    of financial and non-financial instruments on October 1,
    2008 and 2009, respectively. The guidance defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures about fair value



measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange (exit) price
    that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. This standard establishes
    a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon
    the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Observable
    inputs are those which can be easily seen by market participants
    while unobservable inputs are generally developed internally,
    utilizing management’s estimates and assumptions.

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and based on our own estimates about the
    assumptions that market participants would use to value the
    asset or liability.

When available, we use quoted market prices in active markets to
    determine fair value. We consider the principal market and
    nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when
    determining the fair value measurements. Fair value measurements
    are used for our marketable securities, mortgage loans held for
    sale, interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and other
    derivative instruments on a recurring basis, and are used for
    inventories and other mortgage loans on a nonrecurring basis,
    when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value
    may not be recoverable.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess of
    purchase price over net assets acquired. We test goodwill for
    potential impairment annually as of September 30, or more
    frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that
    indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be
    recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill,
    a two-step process is utilized that begins with the estimation
    of the fair value of the operating segments. The fair value is
    estimated primarily utilizing the present values of expected
    future cash flows. If the results of the first step indicate
    that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed
    to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is
    determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is
    less than its carrying value. The goodwill assessment procedures
    require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues
    and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such
    estimates, actual results could differ from our estimates.

Warranty Claims

— We typically provide our
    homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in
    structural elements such as framing components and foundation
    systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical
    systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction
    components. Since we subcontract our homebuilding work to
    subcontractors who typically provide us with an indemnity and a
    certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their
    work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally
    the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty
    liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for
    each home delivered. The amounts charged are based on
    management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs
    under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. Our warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which we operate, and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual
    future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
    amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to
    estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material
    change in our accrual.

Insurance and Legal Claims

— We have, and
    require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have,
    general liability insurance which includes construction defect
    coverage. Our general liability insurance policies protect us
    against a portion of our risk of loss from construction defect
    and other claims and lawsuits, subject to self-insured
    retentions and other coverage limits. For policy years ended
    June 30, 2004 through 2010, we are self-insured for up to
    $22.5 million of the aggregate claims incurred, at which
    point our excess loss insurance begins, depending on the policy
    year. Once we have satisfied the annual aggregate limits, we are
    self-insured for the first $250,000 to $1.0 million for
    each claim occurrence, depending on the policy year. For



policy years 2010 and 2011, we are self-insured for up to
    $20.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, of the
    aggregate claims incurred and for up to $0.5 million of
    each claim occurrence thereafter.

In some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive
    for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, we
    have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability
    insurance requirements to obtain lower costs from
    subcontractors. In these states, we purchase insurance policies
    from either third-party carriers or our wholly-owned captive
    insurance subsidiary, and name certain subcontractors as
    additional insureds. The policies issued by our captive
    insurance subsidiary represent self insurance of these risks by
    us and are considered in the self-insured amounts above. For
    policy years after April 2007, the captive insurance subsidiary
    has acquired $15.0 million of reinsurance coverage with a
    third-party insurer.

We are self-insured for the deductible amounts under our
    workers’ compensation insurance policies. The deductibles
    vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $0.5 million
    per occurrence. The deductible for the 2010 and 2011 policy
    years is $0.5 million per occurrence.

We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs for
    exposures related to construction defects and claims and
    lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business, including
    employment matters, personal injury claims, land development
    issues and contract disputes. Also, we record expenses and
    liabilities for any estimated costs of potential construction
    defect claims and lawsuits (including expected legal costs),
    based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an
    estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet
    reported. Related to the exposures for actual construction
    defect claims and estimates of construction defect claims
    incurred but not yet reported and other legal claims and
    lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business, we
    estimate and record insurance receivables for these matters
    under applicable insurance policies when recovery is probable.
    Additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of
    our legal expenses from our subcontractors when we have been
    named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The
    expenses, liabilities and receivables related to these claims
    are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties
    such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our
    markets, the types of products we build, claim settlement
    patterns, insurance industry practices and legal
    interpretations, among others. A 10% increase in the claim rate
    and the average cost per claim used to estimate the self-insured
    accruals would result in an increase of approximately
    $158.0 million in our accrual and a $91.5 million
    increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of
    $66.5 million, while a 10% decrease in the claim rate and
    the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of
    approximately $109.4 million in our accrual and a
    $75.5 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a
    reduction in our expense of $33.9 million.

Income Taxes

— We calculate a provision for, or
    benefit from, income taxes using the asset and liability method,
    under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
    based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
    basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in
    effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
    reverse. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
    we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events
    that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax
    returns, judgment is required. The accounting for deferred taxes
    is based upon an estimate of future results. Differences between
    the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax
    consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing
    tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of
    deferred tax assets over time.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized in the financial statements as a component of the
    income tax provision. Significant judgment is required to
    evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a
    number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances,
    changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during
    the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues.
    Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax
    positions could result in material increases or decreases in our
    income tax expense in the period in which we make the change.



Stock-based Compensation

— From time to time,
    the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes
    the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to
    employees and directors. The committee approves grants only out
    of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally
    authorized by our common stockholders. Options are granted at
    exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock
    at the date of the grant. Generally, the options vest over
    periods of 5 to 9.75 years and expire 10 years after
    the dates on which they were granted.

We measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal
    to the fair value of share-based payments granted under
    compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified
    after October 1, 2005, using the modified prospective
    method. Compensation expense for any unvested stock option
    awards outstanding as of October 1, 2005 is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. We
    calculate the fair value of stock options using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value
    of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in
    developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables.
    These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected
    stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected
    dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In
    addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of
    share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for
    accounting for transfers of financial assets, which requires
    enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets,
    including securitization transactions, and continuing exposure
    to the related risks. The guidance eliminates the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity and changes the requirements
    for derecognizing financial assets. The guidance is effective
    for us beginning October 1, 2010. The adoption of this
    guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for
    consolidating variable interest entities, which changes how a
    company determines when an entity that is insufficiently
    capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar
    rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a
    company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among
    other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a
    company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. The guidance is effective for us beginning
    October 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance will not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,”
    which requires additional disclosures about transfers between
    Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures
    about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
    forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
    This guidance was effective for us in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2010, except for the Level 3 activity disclosures,
    which are effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance, which is
    related to disclosure only, will not impact our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We
    monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize
    both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes
    in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt
    instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for
    variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not
    impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our
    future earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited
    circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate
    debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and
    changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our
    cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we
    are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our
    mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk
    through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
    (MBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on
    MBS and EDFC. Use of the term “hedging instruments” in
    the following discussion refers to these securities
    collectively, or in any combination. We do not enter into or
    hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers
    who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit
    and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration
    of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to
    a specific purchaser through the use of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to
    being committed to third-party purchasers. The hedging
    instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as
    derivative instruments in an economic hedge, with gains and
    losses recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments
    related to funded, uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair
    value, with changes recognized in current earnings, along with
    changes in the fair value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The
    fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally
    offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the
    fair value change, which for the years ended September 30,
    2010 and 2009 was not significant, is recognized in current
    earnings. At September 30, 2010, hedging instruments used
    to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage
    loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled
    $272.3 million. Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which
    are generally less than six months, totaled approximately
    $166.8 million, and uncommitted mortgage loans held for
    sale totaled approximately $127.1 million at
    September 30, 2010.

At September 30, 2010, we had $3.5 million notional
    amount of forward sales of MBS which were acquired as part of a
    program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest
    rate on their home financing. These hedging instruments and the
    related commitments are accounted for at fair value with gains
    and losses recognized in current earnings. These gains and
    losses for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were not material.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled
    maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair
    value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2010. The
    interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the interest
    rate on our mortgage repurchase facility. Because the mortgage
    repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage
    loans held for sale which are typically sold within
    60 days, its outstanding balance is included as a variable
    rate maturity in the most current period presented.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, total equity,
    and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries at September 30, 2010 and 2009 and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2010 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts,
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Reclassifications/Revisions

In accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for noncontrolling
    interests, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2010,
    the balance sheet at September 30, 2009 has been revised to
    present minority interests (now referred to as noncontrolling
    interests) as a component of equity rather than as a liability.
    Correspondingly, the statements of total equity for the years
    ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 have been revised to
    include noncontrolling interests as a component of equity.

Revenue
    Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized
    at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and
    possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In
    situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI
    Mortgage, the Company’s wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary,
    and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
    investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related
    mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser has been completed. At
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company had deferred
    profit on such sales in the amounts of $2.0 million and
    $2.7 million, respectively. Any profit on land sales is
    deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s
    title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered
    and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally
    occur simultaneously as each home is closed. The Company
    transfers substantially all underwriting risk associated with
    title insurance policies to third-party insurers. In accordance
    with the FASB’s authoritative guidance related to the fair
    value option for financial assets, the Company typically elects
    the fair value option for its mortgage loan originations.
    Mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair
    value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes
    and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the
    loan is sold. The fair value option alleviates the complex
    documentation required had these instruments been designated as
    a fair value hedge. Net origination costs and fees associated
    with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination.
    The expected net future cash flows related to the associated
    servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all
    written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value
    through earnings at the time of commitment. The Company
    generally does not retain or service the mortgages that it
    originates; rather, it seeks to sell the mortgages and related
    servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is
    earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the
    loan is sold.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
    initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. Proceeds from home closings held for the
    Company’s benefit at title companies are included in
    homebuilding cash on the consolidated balance sheet.

Marketable
    Securities

During fiscal 2010, the Company began to invest a portion of its
    cash on hand by purchasing marketable securities with maturities
    in excess of three months. These securities are held in the
    custody of a single financial institution. To be considered for
    investment, securities must meet certain minimum requirements as
    to their credit ratings, time to maturity and other risk-related
    criteria as prescribed by the Company’s investment
    policies. The primary objective of these investments is the
    preservation of capital, with the secondary objectives of
    attaining higher yields than the Company earns on its cash and
    cash equivalents and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.

The Company considers its investment portfolio to be

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value. At
    the end of a reporting period, unrealized gains and losses on
    these investments, net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet.
    Gains and losses realized upon the sale of marketable securities
    are determined by specific identification and are included in
    homebuilding other income. See Notes B and C.

Restricted
    Cash

The Company has cash that is restricted as to its use.
    Restricted cash related to homebuilding operations includes cash
    used as collateral for outstanding letters of credit and
    customer deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance
    with regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2010 and
    2009, the balances of restricted cash were $53.7 million
    and $55.2 million, respectively, and are presented as
    homebuilding restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets.

Inventories
    and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land
    development and home construction, capitalized interest, real
    estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during
    development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead
    costs incurred after development projects or homes are
    substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and
    cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative
    (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs,
    such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region
    management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk
    insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. The specific identification
    method is used for the purpose of accumulating home construction
    costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific
    construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are allocated on a pro-rata basis
    to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant
    development activity, which generally relates to the remaining
    homes in the community.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not yet paid
    and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home.
    A liability and a charge to cost of sales is recorded for the
    amount that is determined will ultimately be paid related to
    completed homes that have been closed. The home construction



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

budgets are compared to actual recorded costs to determine the
    additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. The
    accuracy of the accrual is monitored by comparing actual costs
    incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount
    previously accrued.

Each quarter, inventory is reviewed for the purpose of
    determining whether recorded costs and any estimated costs
    required to complete each home or community are recoverable. If
    the review indicates that an impairment loss is required, an
    estimate of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in
    that quarter.

Land inventory and related communities under development are
    reviewed for potential write-downs when impairment indicators
    are present. The Company generally reviews its inventory at the
    community level and the inventory within each community may be
    categorized as land held for development, residential land and
    lots developed and under development, and construction in
    progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or
    plans for future development. A particular community often
    includes inventory in more than one category. In certain
    situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment
    purposes based on its product type (e.g. single family homes
    evaluated separately from condominium parcels). In reviewing
    each of its communities, the Company determines if impairment
    indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a
    variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, the
    Company performs an analysis to determine if the undiscounted
    cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
    than their carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are
    required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less
    than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are
    significantly impacted by community specific factors including
    estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and
    estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor
    costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local
    market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of the Company’s communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by the Company and its competitors;

•

alternative uses for the Company’s land or communities such
    as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third
    parties;

•

amount of land and lots the Company owns or controls in a
    particular market or

sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The
    Company’s determination of fair value is primarily based on
    discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with
    the inherent risks associated with the assets and related
    estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a
    community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each
    lot in the community in the same manner as



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

land and development costs are allocated to each lot. The
    inventory within each community is categorized as construction
    in progress and finished homes, residential land and lots
    developed and under development, and land held for development,
    based on the stage of production or plans for future development.

The Company typically does not purchase land for resale.
    However, when the Company owns land or communities under
    development that no longer fit into its development and
    construction plans and it is determined that the best use of the
    asset is the sale of the asset, the project is accounted for as
    land held for sale, assuming the land held for sale criteria are
    met. The Company records land held for sale at the lesser of its
    carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In
    performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale, several
    factors are considered including, but not limited to, prices for
    land in recent comparable sales transactions, market analysis
    studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would
    pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received. If the
    estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than
    the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its
    estimated fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in
    substantially completed communities when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair
    values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. The Company’s quarterly assessments reflect
    management’s estimates and it continues to monitor the fair
    value of

held-for-sale

assets through the disposition date. See Note D.

Homebuilding
    Interest

The Company capitalizes homebuilding interest costs to inventory
    during active development and construction. Capitalized interest
    is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is
    delivered to the buyer. Additionally, the Company writes off a
    portion of the capitalized interest related to communities for
    which inventory impairments are recorded. The Company’s
    inventory under active development and construction was lower
    than its debt level during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.
    Therefore, a portion of the interest incurred is reflected as
    interest expense during those years.

The following table summarizes the Company’s homebuilding
    interest costs incurred, capitalized, expensed as interest
    expense, charged to cost of sales and written off during the
    years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Land
    and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

In the ordinary course of its homebuilding business, the Company
    enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these
    contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in
    consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
    land or lots at a future point



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option
    purchase contracts, many of the option deposits are not
    refundable at the Company’s discretion.

Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs incurred related to
    the Company’s land and lot option purchase contracts are
    capitalized if all of the following conditions have been met:
    (1) the costs are directly identifiable with the specific
    property; (2) the costs would be capitalized if the
    property were already acquired; and (3) acquisition of the
    property is probable, meaning the Company is actively seeking
    and has the ability to acquire the property, and there is no
    indication that the property is not available for sale. The
    Company also considers the following when determining if the
    acquisition of the property is probable: (1) changes in
    market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of
    the land; (2) current contract terms, including per lot
    price and required purchase dates; and (3) the
    Company’s current land position in the given market or

sub-market.

Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are
    expensed to cost of sales when the Company believes it is
    probable that it will no longer acquire the land or lots under
    option and will not be able to recover these costs through other
    means.

The Company evaluates its land and lot option purchase contracts
    for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in
    certain variable interest entities, which are defined as
    business entities that either have equity investors with voting
    rights disproportionate to their ownership interests, or have
    equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
    resources for the entities to support their activities. Certain
    option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable
    interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. The
    Company evaluates those land and lot option purchase contracts
    with variable interest entities to determine whether the Company
    is the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the
    variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. The
    expected gains and losses are primarily determined by the amount
    of deposit required by the contract, the time period or term of
    the contract, and by analyzing the volatility in home sales
    prices as well as development and entitlement risk in each
    specific market. Based on this evaluation, if the Company is the
    primary beneficiary of an entity with which the Company has
    entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the
    variable interest entity is consolidated. Since the Company owns
    no equity interest in these unaffiliated variable interest
    entities, it generally has little or no control or influence
    over the operations of these entities or their owners. When the
    Company’s requests for financial information are denied by
    the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and
    liabilities of these entities are required. In most cases, the
    fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been
    assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the
    land or lots the Company is purchasing. In these cases, it is
    assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only
    asset recorded is the land or lots the Company has the option to
    buy with a related offset to noncontrolling interest for the
    assumed third-party investment in the variable interest entity.
    See Note E.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
    asset. Depreciable lives for model home furniture typically
    range from 2 to 3 years, depreciable lives for office
    furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years,
    and depreciable lives for buildings and improvements typically
    range from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
    $150.8 million and $157.4 million as of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Depreciation
    expense was $17.2 million, $25.7 million and
    $53.2 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company adopted the FASB’s authoritative guidance for
    fair value measurements of financial and non-financial
    instruments on October 1, 2008 and 2009, respectively. The
    guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value is defined as the exchange (exit) price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. This standard establishes a three-level
    hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the inputs to
    the valuation of an asset or liability. Observable inputs are
    those which can be easily seen by market participants while
    unobservable inputs are generally developed internally,
    utilizing management’s estimates and assumptions.

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about
    the assumptions that market participants would use to value the
    asset or liability.

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active
    markets to determine fair value. The Company considers the
    principal market and nonperformance risk associated with the
    Company’s counterparties when determining the fair value
    measurements, if applicable. Fair value measurements are used
    for the Company’s marketable securities, mortgage loans
    held for sale, interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and other
    derivative instruments on a recurring basis, and are used for
    inventories, other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a
    nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note H.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets
    acquired. The Company tests goodwill for potential impairment
    annually as of September 30, or more frequently if an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining
    balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the
    potential impairment of goodwill, a two-step process is utilized
    that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the
    operating segments. If the results of the first step indicate
    that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed
    to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is
    determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is
    less than its carrying value.

In performing its goodwill impairment analysis, the Company
    estimates the fair value of its operating segments utilizing the
    present values of expected future cash flows. As a result of the
    analyses performed as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, it
    was determined that the fair value of the operating segments was
    greater than their carrying value and therefore, no impairment
    of goodwill existed. As a result of the analysis performed as of
    September 30, 2008, the Company recorded a goodwill
    impairment charge of $79.4 million, all of which related to
    its Southwest reporting segment. Combined with previous
    impairments, accumulated goodwill impairment losses at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009 totaled $553.5 million. As
    of September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s
    remaining goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of which
    related to its South Central reporting segment. The goodwill
    assessment procedures require management to make comprehensive
    estimates of future revenues and costs.

Warranty
    Claims

The Company typically provides its homebuyers with a ten-year
    limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such
    as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited
    warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited
    warranty on other construction components. Since the Company
    subcontracts its homebuilding work to subcontractors who
    typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of
    insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims
    relating to workmanship and



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

materials are generally the primary responsibility of the
    subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have been established by
    charging cost of sales for each home delivered. The amounts
    charged are based on management’s estimate of expected
    warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation
    periods. The Company’s warranty liability is based upon
    historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it
    operates, and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative
    risks associated with the types of homes built and the
    geographic areas in which they are built. See Note M.

Insurance
    and Legal Claims

The Company has, and requires the majority of the subcontractors
    it uses to have, general liability insurance which includes
    construction defect coverage. The Company’s general
    liability insurance policies protect it against a portion of its
    risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and
    lawsuits, subject to self-insured retentions and other coverage
    limits. For policy years ended June 30, 2004 through 2010,
    the Company is self-insured for up to $22.5 million of the
    aggregate claims incurred, at which point the excess loss
    insurance begins, depending on the policy year. Once the Company
    has satisfied the annual aggregate limits, it is self-insured
    for the first $250,000 to $1.0 million for each claim
    occurrence, depending on the policy year. For policy years 2010
    and 2011, the Company is self-insured for up to
    $20.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, of the
    aggregate claims incurred and for up to $0.5 million of
    each claim occurrence thereafter.

In some states where the Company believes it is too difficult or
    expensive for its subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, the Company has waived its traditional subcontractor
    general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs
    from subcontractors. In these states, the Company purchases
    insurance policies from either third-party carriers or its
    wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and names certain
    subcontractors as additional insureds. The policies issued by
    the captive insurance subsidiary represent self insurance of
    these risks by the Company and are considered in the
    self-insured amounts above. For policy years after April 2007,
    the captive insurance subsidiary has acquired $15.0 million
    of reinsurance coverage with a third-party insurer.

The Company is self-insured for the deductible amounts under its
    workers’ compensation insurance policies. The deductibles
    vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $0.5 million
    per occurrence. The deductible for the 2010 and 2011 policy
    years was $0.5 million per occurrence.

The Company records expenses and liabilities related to the
    costs for exposures related to construction defects and claims
    and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business,
    including employment matters, personal injury claims, land
    development issues and contract disputes. Also, the Company
    records expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of
    potential construction defect claims and lawsuits (including
    expected legal costs), based on an analysis of the
    Company’s historical claims, which includes an estimate of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
    Related to the exposures for actual construction defect claims
    and estimates of construction defect claims incurred but not yet
    reported and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the
    ordinary course of business, the Company estimates and records
    insurance receivables for these matters under applicable
    insurance policies when recovery is probable. Additionally, the
    Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its legal
    expenses from its subcontractors when the Company has been named
    as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The
    expenses, liabilities and receivables related to these claims
    are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties
    such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the
    Company’s markets, the types of products it builds, claim
    settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal
    interpretations, among others. See Note M.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    expense was approximately $39.3 million, $31.7 million
    and $60.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes is calculated
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference
    between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
    liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the
    realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
    which those temporary differences become deductible. In
    determining the future tax consequences of events that have been
    recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax
    returns, judgment is required. Differences between the
    anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences
    could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized in the financial statements as a component of the
    income tax provision. Significant judgment is required to
    evaluate uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates its
    uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations
    are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts
    or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax
    authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement
    of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of
    uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or
    decreases in the Company’s income tax expense in the period
    in which the change is made. See Note I.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings, or loss, per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
    year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities
    outstanding during each year. See Note J.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

From time to time, the compensation committee of the
    Company’s board of directors authorizes the issuance of
    options to purchase the Company’s common stock to employees
    and directors. The committee approves grants only out of amounts
    remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized
    by the common stockholders.

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense at an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted
    under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or
    modified after October 1, 2005, using the modified
    prospective method. Compensation expense for any unvested stock
    option awards outstanding as of October 1, 2005 is
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting
    period. The fair values of the options are calculated on the
    date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
    expense are reported in the Statement of Cash Flows as a
    financing cash flow. See Note L.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for
    accounting for transfers of financial assets, which requires
    enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets,
    including securitization transactions, and continuing exposure
    to the related risks. The guidance eliminates the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity and changes the requirements
    for derecognizing financial assets. The guidance is effective
    for the Company beginning October 1, 2010. The adoption of
    this guidance will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In June 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for
    consolidating variable interest entities, which changes how a
    company determines when an entity that is insufficiently
    capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar
    rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a
    company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among
    other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a
    company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning
    October 1, 2010. The adoption of this guidance will not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,”
    which requires additional disclosures about transfers between
    Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures
    about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
    forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
    This guidance was effective for the Company in the third quarter
    of fiscal 2010, except for the Level 3 activity
    disclosures, which are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance,
    which is related to disclosure only, will not impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Of the $297.7 million in marketable securities,
    $277.9 million mature in the next twelve months and
    $19.8 million mature in one to two years. Proceeds from the
    sale of securities during fiscal 2010 were $27.7 million.
    The Company’s realized gains related to such sales were
    insignificant.

NOTE D —
    INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS AND LAND OPTION COST WRITE-OFFS

During fiscal 2010, when the Company performed its quarterly
    inventory impairment analysis, the assumptions utilized
    reflected the Company’s expectation of continued
    challenging conditions and uncertainties in the homebuilding
    industry and in its markets. The impairment evaluation at
    September 30, 2010 indicated communities with a combined
    carrying value of $409.8 million had indicators of
    potential impairment, and these communities were evaluated for
    impairment. The analysis of the large majority of these
    communities assumed that sales prices in future periods will be
    equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each
    community, or in comparable communities, in order to generate an
    acceptable absorption rate. For a minority of communities that
    the Company does not intend to develop or operate in current
    market conditions, slight increases over current sales prices
    were assumed. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe for
    a given community in the current market conditions, the
    remaining lives of these communities were estimated to be in a
    range from six months to in excess of ten years. In performing
    this analysis, the Company utilized a range of discount rates
    for communities of 14% to 20%. Through this evaluation process,
    it was determined that communities with a carrying value of
    $63.1 million as of September 30, 2010 were impaired.
    As a result, during the three months ended September 30,
    2010, impairment charges of $29.1 million were recorded to
    reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their
    estimated fair value, as compared to $174.9 million in the
    same period of the prior year. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008, impairment charges totaled $62.3 million,
    $377.8 million and $2,372.6 million, respectively.

The Company performs its impairment analysis based on total
    inventory at the community level. When an impairment charge for
    a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each
    lot in the community in the same manner as land and development
    costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each
    community is categorized as construction in progress and
    finished homes, residential land and lots developed and under
    development, and land held for development, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development. During fiscal
    2010, approximately 93% of the impairment charges were recorded
    to residential land and lots and land held for development, and
    approximately 7% of the charges were recorded to residential
    construction in progress and finished homes inventory, compared
    to 85% and 15%, respectively, in fiscal 2009 and 79% and 21%,
    respectively, in fiscal 2008.

The Company’s estimate of undiscounted cash flows from
    communities analyzed may change and could result in a future
    need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value
    of these assets to their estimated fair value. There are several
    factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of
    undiscounted future cash flows for a given community. The most
    significant of these include pricing and incentive levels
    actually realized by the community, the rate at which the homes
    are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and
    construct the homes. The pricing and incentive levels are often
    inter-related with sales pace within a community such that a
    price reduction can be expected to increase the sales pace.
    Further, both of these factors are heavily influenced by the
    competitive pressures facing a given community from both new
    homes and existing homes, some of which may result from
    foreclosures. If conditions in the broader economy, homebuilding
    industry or specific markets in which the Company operates
    worsen, and as the Company re-evaluates specific community
    pricing and incentives, construction and development plans, and
    its overall land sale strategies, it may be required to evaluate
    additional communities or re-evaluate previously impaired
    communities for potential impairment. These evaluations may
    result in additional impairment charges.

At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company had
    $3.3 million and $15.1 million, respectively, of land
    held for sale, consisting of land held for development and land
    under development that met the criteria of land held for sale.

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company wrote off
    $2.4 million, $29.9 million and $111.9 million,
    respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to land option contracts which are not expected to
    be acquired.

NOTE E —
    LAND INVENTORY NOT OWNED

The Company’s land inventory not owned includes its
    interests in land and lots controlled under certain option
    purchase contracts with variable interest entities, and may also
    include the purchase price of certain land and lot option
    purchase contracts that have been determined to represent
    financing arrangements.

The consolidation of variable interest entities added
    $7.6 million and $6.5 million in land inventory not
    owned and noncontrolling interests related to entities not owned
    to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    Company’s obligations related to these land or lot option
    contracts are guaranteed by deposits, including cash, promissory
    notes and surety bonds, totaling $0.6 million as of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009. Creditors, if any, of these
    variable interest entities have no recourse against the Company.

For the variable interest entities which are unconsolidated
    because the Company is not subject to a majority of the risk of
    loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entities’
    residual returns, the maximum exposure to loss is generally
    limited to the amounts of the Company’s option deposits. At
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, the amount of option deposits
    related to these contracts totaled $10.2 million and
    $8.0 million, respectively, and are included in
    homebuilding other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Additionally, at September 30, 2009, the Company determined
    that certain of its land and lot option purchase contracts
    represented financing arrangements. As a result, the Company
    added $7.8 million in land inventory not owned, with a
    corresponding increase to accrued expenses and other
    liabilities, to its balance sheet at September 30, 2009.

    all existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated to
    them. The senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of
    the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries other than its
    financial services subsidiaries. Upon a change of control of the
    Company (as defined), holders of all series of notes issued
    prior to October 2004, constituting $587.8 million
    principal amount in the aggregate as of September 30, 2010,
    have the right to require the Company to purchase these notes at
    a price of 101% of their principal amount, along with accrued
    and unpaid interest. If a fundamental change, including a change
    in control (as defined), occurs as defined in the indenture
    governing the convertible senior notes, holders of the
    convertible senior notes, constituting $500 million
    principal amount as of September 30, 2010, have the right

In October 2010, through an unsolicited transaction, the Company
    repurchased $8.3 million principal amount of its
    5.375% senior notes due 2012, for a purchase price of
    $8.6 million, plus accrued interest.

The indentures governing the Company’s senior notes impose
    restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At

    of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the
    public debt obligations.

Financial
    Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, entered
    into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement (the
    “mortgage repurchase facility”) on March 28,
    2008. The mortgage repurchase facility, which is accounted for
    as a secured financing, provides financing and liquidity to DHI
    Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI
    Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against
    the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming
    purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
    to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party
    purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time
    frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of
    the mortgage repurchase facility. The capacity of the facility
    is $100 million, with a provision allowing an increase in
    the capacity to $125 million during the last five business
    days of any fiscal quarter and the first seven business days of
    the following fiscal quarter. The maturity date of the facility
    is March 4, 2011.

As of September 30, 2010, $236.9 million of mortgage
    loans held for sale were pledged under the repurchase agreement.
    These mortgage loans had a collateral value of
    $222.7 million. DHI Mortgage has the option to fund a
    portion of its repurchase obligations in advance. As a result of
    advance paydowns totaling $136.2 million, DHI Mortgage had
    an obligation of $86.5 million outstanding under the
    mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2010 at a
    3.8% interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the
    Company’s homebuilding debt. The facility contains
    financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum
    required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt
    to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity. At
    September 30, 2010, the mortgage subsidiary was in
    compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the
    mortgage repurchase facility.

NOTE G —
    MORTGAGE LOANS

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage
    operations, the Company hedges its risk using various derivative
    instruments, which include forward sales of mortgage-backed
    securities (MBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put
    options on both MBS and EDFC. Use of the term “hedging
    instruments” in the following discussion refers to these
    securities collectively, or in any combination. The Company does
    not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative
    purposes.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family
    residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.
    Newly originated loans that have been closed but not committed
    to third-party purchasers are hedged to mitigate the risk of
    changes in their fair value. Hedged loans are committed to
    third-party purchasers typically within three days after
    origination. Consistent with the prior two fiscal years,
    approximately 86% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage
    during fiscal 2010 were sold to two major financial institutions
    pursuant to their loan purchase agreements with DHI Mortgage. At
    September 30, 2010, mortgage loans held for sale had an
    aggregate fair value of $253.8 million and an aggregate
    outstanding principal balance of $247.5 million. At
    September 30, 2009, mortgage loans held for sale had an
    aggregate fair value of $220.8 million and an aggregate
    outstanding principal balance of $217.2 million. During the
    years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    had net gains on sales of loans of

$45.9 million, $23.6 million and $69.1 million,
    respectively, which includes the effect of recording recourse
    expense of $13.7 million, $33.2 million and
    $21.9 million, respectively, as discussed in the
    “Other Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves” section below.

The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge
    mortgage loans held for sale vary in relationship to the
    underlying loan amounts, depending on the movements in the value
    of each hedging instrument relative to the value of the
    underlying mortgage loans. The fair value change related to the
    hedging instruments generally offsets the fair value change in
    the mortgage loans held for sale, which for the years ended
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not significant, and
    is recognized in current earnings. As of September 30,
    2010, the Company had $127.1 million in mortgage loans held
    for sale not committed to third-party purchasers and the
    notional amounts of the hedging instruments related to those
    loans totaled $123.1 million.

Other
    Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves

Generally, mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse
    provisions which include industry-standard representations and
    warranties, primarily involving the absence of
    misrepresentations by the borrower or other parties and,
    depending on the agreement, may include requiring a minimum
    number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company
    generally does not retain any other continuing interest related
    to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. Other mortgage
    loans generally consist of loans repurchased due to these
    limited recourse obligations. Typically, these loans are
    impaired and often become real estate owned through the
    foreclosure process. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company’s total other mortgage loans and real estate owned
    were as follows:

Based on historical performance and current housing and credit

    estimated losses on other mortgage loans, real estate owned and
    future loan repurchase obligations due to the limited recourse
    provisions, all of which are recorded as reductions of financial
    services revenue. These reserves totaled $39.0 million and
    $43.6 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, allocated as follows:

A subsidiary of the Company reinsured a portion of private

    in prior years. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, reserves
    for expected future losses under the reinsurance program totaled
    $9.7 million and $18.7 million, respectively. The
    mortgage repurchase and reinsurance loss reserves are included
    in financial services accounts payable and other

liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. It
    is possible that future losses may exceed the amount of reserves
    and, if so, additional charges will be required.

Loan
    Commitments and Related Derivatives

The Company is party to IRLCs which are extended to borrowers
    who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and
    underwriting criteria. The expected net future cash flows
    related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in
    the measurement of all written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of
    commitment. At September 30, 2010, IRLCs, which are
    accounted for as derivative instruments recorded at fair value,
    totaled $180.0 million.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs
    through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments
    and hedging instruments. These instruments are considered
    derivatives in an economic hedge and are accounted for at fair
    value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. As
    of September 30, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $13.2 million of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments and $149.2 million of hedging instruments
    related to IRLCs not yet committed to purchasers.

At September 30, 2010, the Company had $3.5 million
    notional amount of forward sales of MBS which were acquired as
    part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market
    interest rate on their home financing. These hedging instruments
    and the related commitments are accounted for at fair value with
    gains and losses recognized in current earnings. These gains and
    losses for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were not material.

NOTE H —
    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company’s marketable securities consist of
    U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities,
    corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, and
    certificates of deposit. The fair value of U.S. Treasury
    securities is based on quoted prices for identical assets and
    therefore, they have been classified as a Level 1
    valuation. Obligations of government agencies, corporate debt
    securities, foreign government securities and certificates of
    deposit are valued using quoted market prices of recent
    transactions or quoted market prices of transactions in very
    similar securities and therefore, are classified as Level 2
    valuations.

The value of mortgage loans held for sale includes changes in
    estimated fair value from the date the loan is closed until the
    date the loan is sold. The fair value of mortgage loans held for
    sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in
    secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with
    similar characteristics; therefore, they have been classified as
    a Level 2 valuation. After consideration of nonperformance
    risk, no additional adjustments have been made to the fair value
    measurement of mortgage loans held for sale. Closed mortgage
    loans are typically sold within 30 days of origination,
    limiting any nonperformance exposure period. In addition, the
    Company actively monitors the financial strength of its
    counterparties and has limited the number of counterparties
    utilized in loan sale transactions due to the current market
    volatility in the mortgage and bank environment.

The hedging instruments utilized by the Company to manage its
    interest rate risk and hedge the changes in the fair value of
    mortgage loans held for sale are publicly traded derivatives
    with fair value measurements based on quoted market prices.
    Exchange-traded derivatives are considered Level 1
    valuations because quoted prices for identical assets are used
    for fair value measurements.

Over-the-counter

derivatives, such as forward sales of MBS, are classified as
    Level 2 valuations because quoted prices for similar assets
    are used for fair value measurements. The Company mitigates
    exposure to nonperformance risk associated with

over-the-counter

derivatives by limiting the number of counterparties and
    actively monitoring their financial strength and
    creditworthiness while requiring them to be well-known
    institutions with credit ratings equal to or better than AA- or
    equivalent. Further, the Company’s derivative contracts
    typically have short-term durations with maturities from one to
    four months. Accordingly, the Company’s risk of
    nonperformance relative to its



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

derivative positions is also not significant. Nonperformance
    risk associated with exchange-traded derivatives is considered
    minimal as these items are traded on the Chicago Mercantile
    Exchange. After consideration of nonperformance risk, no
    additional adjustments have been made to the fair value
    measurement of hedging instruments.

The fair values of IRLCs are also calculated by reference to
    quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell
    mortgage loans with similar characteristics; therefore, they
    have been classified as Level 2 valuations. These
    valuations do not contain adjustments for expirations as any
    expired commitments are excluded from the fair value
    measurement. After consideration of nonperformance risk, no
    additional adjustments have been made to the fair value
    measurements of IRLCs. The Company generally only issues IRLCs
    for products that meet specific purchaser guidelines. Should any
    purchaser become insolvent, the Company would not be required to
    close the transaction based on the terms of the commitment.
    Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, the Company
    adjusts its fair value measurements for the estimated amount of
    IRLCs that will not close.

Inventory held and used is reported at the lower of carrying
    value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The factors
    considered in determining fair values of the Company’s
    communities are described in the discussion of the
    Company’s inventory impairment analysis (see Note D),
    and are classified as Level 3 valuations. Inventory held
    and used measured at fair value represents those communities for
    which the Company has recorded impairments during the current
    period.

Other mortgage loans and real estate owned are measured at the
    lower of carrying value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
    Other mortgage loans include performing and nonperforming
    mortgage loans. The fair values of other mortgage loans and real
    estate owned are determined based on the Company’s
    assessment of the value of the underlying collateral and are
    classified as Level 3 valuations.

The fair values included in the

    were adjusted to fair value in the current quarter.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their
    carrying amounts due to their short-term nature. The Company
    determines fair value of its senior and convertible senior notes
    based on quoted market prices. The aggregate fair value of these
    notes at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009 was
    $2,244.0 million and $3,187.6 million, respectively,
    compared to carrying values of $2,050.1 million and
    $3,039.5 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of
    the Company’s senior notes includes fair values for the 2%
    convertible senior notes of $553.8 million and
    $568.6 million at September 30, 2010 and
    September 30, 2009, respectively, compared to their
    carrying values of $391.9 million and $368.0 million,
    respectively. The carrying value of the equity component of the
    2% convertible senior notes was $136.7 million at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009. For other secured notes and
    balances due under the mortgage repurchase facility, the fair
    values approximate their carrying amounts due to their short
    maturity or floating interest rate terms, as applicable.

In November 2009, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business
    Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted into law and amended
    Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. This tax law
    change allows a net operating loss (NOL) realized in one of the
    Company’s fiscal 2008, 2009 or 2010 years to be
    carried back up to five years (previously limited to a two-year
    carryback). The Company elected to carry back its fiscal 2009
    NOL. This resulted in a benefit from income taxes of
    $208.3 million during fiscal 2010 which was partially
    offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and state
    income tax expense.

The Company does not have meaningful effective tax rates in
    fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 because of the valuation
    allowances on its deferred tax assets. In fiscal 2008, the
    impairment of nondeductible goodwill was also a factor. The
    difference between income tax expense (benefit) and tax computed
    by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% to
    income (loss) before income taxes during each year is due to the
    following:

The Company had income taxes receivable of $16.0 million
    and $293.1 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. During fiscal 2010, the Company received income
    tax refunds totaling $487.1 million, which resulted from
    tax losses generated in fiscal 2008 and 2009. The income taxes
    receivable at September 30, 2010 relates to additional
    federal and state income tax refunds the Company expects to
    receive.

At September 30, 2010, the Company had a federal NOL
    carryforward of $285.8 million that will expire in fiscal
    2030 and tax benefits for state NOL carryforwards of
    $83.5 million that expire (beginning at various times
    depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal 2013 to fiscal
    2030.

Due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding
    industry during the past several years, the Company has recorded
    significant impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill
    and was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position at the
    end of fiscal 2008. Since the cumulative loss position is
    significant negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of
    the Company’s deferred tax assets, the Company recorded a
    valuation allowance during fiscal 2008. At September 30,
    2010 and 2009, the Company had net deferred tax assets of
    $902.6 million and $1,073.9 million, respectively,
    offset by valuation allowances of $902.6 million and
    $1,073.9 million, respectively.

The future realization of the Company’s deferred income tax
    assets ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient
    taxable income in its carryforward periods under the tax laws.
    The Company continues to analyze the positive and negative
    evidence in determining the expected realization of its deferred
    income tax assets. The accounting for deferred taxes is based
    upon an estimate of future results. Differences between the
    anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences
    could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing
    tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of
    deferred tax assets over time.

The benefits of the Company’s NOL and tax credit
    carryforwards, as well as its unrealized built-in losses, would
    be reduced or potentially eliminated if the Company experienced
    an ownership change as defined by Internal Revenue Code
    Section 382. The Company does not believe it has
    experienced such an ownership change as of September 30,
    2010; however, the amount by which its ownership may change in
    the future is affected by purchases and sales of stock by 5%
    stockholders; the potential conversion of the Company’s
    outstanding convertible senior notes and its decision as to
    whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially
    in stock; and new issuances of stock by the Company.

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between a tax
    position taken, or expected to be taken in a tax return, and the
    benefit recognized for accounting purposes. The following table
    sets forth the changes in unrecognized income tax benefits
    during fiscal 2010 and 2009:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits includes interest,
    penalties, and the tax benefit relating to the deductibility of
    interest and state income taxes. All tax positions, if
    recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax
    rate. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits to
    $82.8 million at September 30, 2010 from
    $24.0 million at September 30, 2009 resulted in large
    part from the Company’s election to carryback its fiscal
    2009 NOL to fiscal 2004 and 2005, thereby changing the reserve
    needed for all years open to further tax assessment including
    2004 and 2005. It is reasonably possible that, within the next
    12 months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may
    decrease as much as $59.2 million as a result of a ruling
    request filed by the Company with the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS) concerning capitalization of inventory costs. If the IRS
    rules favorably on the ruling request, the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits would be reduced, resulting in a
    benefit from income taxes in the consolidated statement of
    operations.

The Company classifies interest and penalties on income taxes as
    income tax expense. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company recognized interest and penalties with respect to income
    taxes of $11.7 million, $3.0 million and
    $4.0 million, respectively, in its consolidated statements
    of operations, and at September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company’s total accrued interest and penalties relating to
    unrecognized income tax benefits was $17.8 million and
    $6.2 million, respectively.

The Company is subject to federal income tax and to income tax
    in multiple states. The statute of limitations for the
    Company’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for
    examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2010. The Company is
    currently being audited by various states and its federal NOL
    refunds from fiscal 2008 and 2009 are subject to Congressional
    Joint Committee review.

    EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the numerators and denominators

    share. In fiscal 2010, options to purchase 10.2 million
    shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of
    diluted earnings per share because the exercise price was
    greater than the average market price of the common shares and,
    therefore, their effect would have been antidilutive. In fiscal
    2010 and 2009, the convertible senior notes were excluded from
    the computation of diluted earnings per share

    3.8 million shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance
    pursuant to the D.R. Horton, Inc. Stock Incentive Plans and
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, respectively.

In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company’s
    common stock. The authorization is effective through
    July 31, 2011. The Company made no repurchases of its
    common stock under the share repurchase program during fiscal
    2010; therefore, all of the $100 million authorization was
    remaining at September 30, 2010.

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Board of Directors approved and
    paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.0375 per common share.
    On November 11, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a
    cash dividend of $0.0375 per common share, payable on
    December 8, 2010, to stockholders of record on
    November 24, 2010.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred
    Compensation

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all Company employees who have
    been with the Company for a period of six months or more. The
    Company matches portions of employees’ voluntary
    contributions. Additional employer contributions in the form of
    profit sharing may also be made at the Company’s
    discretion. Expenses for the plan were $4.8 million,
    $3.9 million and $3.5 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008 respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
    is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides
    benefits payable to certain management employees upon
    retirement, death, or termination of employment with the
    Company. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit
    based on a percentage of the eligible employees’ salaries,
    as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined
    formula. The Company’s liabilities related to the SERP were
    $15.2 million and $13.2 million at

September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
    recorded $2.7 million, $2.2 million and
    $2.1 million of expense for this plan in fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a
    select group of employees. The participating employees designate
    investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not
    required to invest the contributions in the designated
    investments. The Company’s net liabilities related to the
    deferred compensation plan were $24.6 million and
    $31.3 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the
    employee contributions would have earned had the funds been
    invested in the designated investments. In fiscal 2010, the
    Company recorded expense of $2.1 million for this plan, and
    in fiscal 2009 and 2008, it recorded a reduction in expense of
    $1.1 million and $7.1 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides
    eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of
    the Company at a discounted price of no more than 85% of the
    fair market value of the stock on the designated dates of
    purchase. The price may be further discounted depending on the
    average fair market value of the stock during the period and
    certain other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total
    fair market value of the common stock that an eligible employee
    may purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the
    employee’s annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan,
    employees of the Company purchased 107,952 shares for
    $1.1 million in fiscal 2010, 155,254 shares for
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2009 and 168,194 shares for
    $2.0 million in fiscal 2008.

Stock
    Options

The Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the
    granting of stock options to certain key employees of the
    Company to purchase shares of common stock. Options are granted
    at exercise prices which equal the market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. Generally,
    the options vest over periods of 5 to 9.75 years and expire
    10 years after the dates on which they were granted.

During fiscal 2009 and 2008, stock options were granted to
    purchase a total of 6.1 million shares and 6.5 million
    shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock at the
    closing market price of the stock on the date of the grant. The
    Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
    granted all such stock options to the Company’s executive
    officers, other officers and certain of its employees, and the
    Company’s Board of Directors granted all such stock options
    to its outside directors. No stock options were granted during
    fiscal 2010. At September 30, 2010, there were
    19.5 million shares available for future grants under the
    Plan.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $7.6 million, $4.6 million and
    $11.8 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock
    option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying
    stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and
    exercisable at September 30, 2010 was $12.9 million
    and $2.2 million, respectively. Exercise prices for options
    outstanding at September 30, 2010, ranged from $4.70 to
    $36.92. The weighted average remaining contractual lives of
    options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2010
    were 6.2 years and 4.5 years, respectively.

There were no options granted in fiscal 2010. The weighted
    average fair value of grants made in fiscal 2009 and 2008 was
    $3.89 and $4.48 per share, respectively. The fair values of the
    options granted were estimated on the date of their grant using
    the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following
    weighted average assumptions:

For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s compensation
    expense related to stock option grants was $13.3 million,
    $13.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively, and at
    September 30, 2010, there was $48.2 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 5.8 years.

Incentive
    Bonus Plan

Under the Company’s Incentive Bonus Plan, the maximum award
    limits are determined by a performance-based formula tied to the
    actual performance period established under the plan, combined
    with a fixed dollar amount. Performance periods may be based on
    one or more months, quarters or years, although no covered
    employee may receive both a monthly or quarterly award and an
    annual award with respect to the same fiscal year. At
    September 30, 2010, the Company had $1.8 million
    accrued related to the Incentive Bonus Plan.

Restricted
    Stock Unit Agreement

On September 30, 2010, The Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors adopted and approved a form of Restricted
    Stock Unit Agreement (RSU Agreement) for awards to executive
    officers and other key employees of the Company pursuant to the
    2006 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the form of RSU Agreement, the
    Compensation Committee may award performance or service (time)
    based restricted stock units subject to the terms and conditions
    of the RSU Agreement and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

On September 30, 2010, the Compensation Committee approved
    and granted an award of 200,000 performance based restricted
    stock units (Performance RSUs) that will vest at the end of a
    two year performance period ending September 30, 2012. The
    number of units that ultimately vest depends on the
    Company’s relative position as compared to its peers at the
    end of the two year period in achieving certain performance
    criteria and can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units
    granted. The performance criteria are total shareholder return,
    return on investment, SG&A expense containment and gross
    profit. Each Performance RSU represents the contingent right to
    receive one share of the Company’s common stock if the
    vesting conditions are satisfied. The Performance RSUs have no
    dividend or voting rights during the performance period. The
    fair value of these awards on the date of grant is $11.53 per
    unit.

Performance
    Unit Plan

The Company’s Performance Unit Plan, which was adopted in
    fiscal 2008, provides for the Compensation Committee to award
    performance units to senior management based upon the level of
    achievement of certain criteria. Performance units were granted
    in 2008 and 2009 with

33-month

performance periods ending on September 30, 2010 and 2011,
    respectively. The actual number of performance units earned is
    based upon the Company’s level of achievement on defined
    performance metrics as compared to its peer group. The earned
    award will have a value equal to the number of earned units
    multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s common
    stock at the end of the performance period and may be paid in
    cash, equity or a combination of both. The Compensation
    Committee has the discretion to reduce the final payout on the
    performance units from the amount earned. The liability for
    these awards has been based on the Company’s performance
    against the peer group, the elapsed portion of the performance
    period and the Company’s stock price as of each reporting
    date, and previously assumed no future reduction of the earned
    value of the performance units by the Compensation Committee.
    Because the values of the earned performance units are dependent
    on the Company’s performance and the common stock price,
    and because the final amount can be reduced at the discretion of
    the Compensation Committee, this liability has been subject to a
    high degree of volatility.

Subsequent to September 30, 2010, the Compensation
    Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the amount earned
    under the 2008 performance unit grant to $4.9 million and
    expects to limit the amount which may be earned under the 2009
    performance unit grant to approximately $4.1 million. The
    liability related to the 2008 and 2009 performance unit grants
    was $9.0 million and $11.3 million at
    September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009,
    respectively. Compensation expense (benefit) related to these
    grants were ($2.3) million and $7.7 million for fiscal
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

NOTE M —
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Warranty
    Claims

At September 30, 2010, the Company had liabilities of
    $2.6 million for the remaining repair costs of homes in its
    South Florida and Louisiana markets constructed during 2005
    through 2007 which contain or are suspected to contain allegedly
    defective drywall manufactured in China (Chinese Drywall) that
    may be responsible for accelerated corrosion of certain metals
    in the home. The Company first learned of this potential issue
    during fiscal 2009 through customer inquiries. The Company has
    identified approximately 90 homes which contain or are suspected
    to contain Chinese Drywall through a review of the supply
    channel for



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

its homes constructed in these markets and of the warranty
    claims received in these markets as well as testing of specific
    homes. Through September 30, 2010, the Company has spent
    approximately $4.9 million to remediate these homes. While
    the Company will seek reimbursement for these remediation costs
    from various sources, it has not recorded a receivable for
    potential recoveries as of September 30, 2010. The Company
    is continuing its investigation to determine if there are
    additional homes with the Chinese Drywall in these markets,
    which if found, would likely require the Company to further
    increase its warranty reserve for this matter in the future. The
    remaining costs accrued to complete this remediation are based
    on the Company’s estimate of remaining repair costs. If the
    actual costs to remediate the homes differ from the estimated
    costs, the Company may revise its warranty estimate. As of
    September 30, 2010, the Company has been named as a
    defendant in several lawsuits in Louisiana and Florida
    pertaining to Chinese Drywall. As these actions are still in
    their early stages, the Company is unable to express an opinion
    as to the amount of damages, if any, beyond what has been
    reserved for repair as discussed above.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability during fiscal
    2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Insurance
    and Legal Claims

The Company has been named as defendant in various claims,
    complaints and other legal actions including construction defect
    claims on closed homes and other claims and lawsuits incurred in
    the ordinary course of business, including employment matters,
    personal injury claims, land development issues, contract
    disputes and claims related to its mortgage activities. The
    Company has established reserves for these contingencies, based
    on the expected costs of the claims. The Company’s
    estimates of such reserves are based on the facts and
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends, including costs relative to revenues, home closings
    and product types, and include estimates of the costs of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. These
    reserve estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are
    recorded in the accounting period in which the change in
    estimate occurs. The Company’s liabilities for these items
    were $571.3 million and $534.0 million at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included
    in homebuilding accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Related to the contingencies for
    construction defect claims and estimates of construction defect
    claims incurred but not yet reported, and other legal claims and
    lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business, the
    Company estimates and records insurance receivables for these
    matters under applicable insurance policies when recovery is
    probable. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to
    recover a portion of its legal expenses from its subcontractors
    when the Company has been named as an additional insured on
    their insurance policies. Estimates of the Company’s
    insurance receivables related to these matters totaled
    $251.5 million and $234.6 million at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are included
    in homebuilding other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
    Expenses related to these items were approximately
    $43.2 million, $58.3 million and $53.8 million in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Management believes that, while the outcome of such
    contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the
    liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

financial position, results of operations or cash flows. To the
    extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any
    matter exceeds management’s estimates reflected in the
    recorded reserves relating to these matters, the Company would
    incur additional charges that could be significant.

Land
    and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land
    and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. At September 30, 2010,
    the Company had total deposits of $13.3 million, consisting
    of cash deposits of $11.2 million, promissory notes of
    $1.9 million, and letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $0.2 million, to purchase land and lots with a total
    remaining purchase price of $963.9 million. Within the land
    and lot option purchase contracts at September 30, 2010,
    there were a limited number of contracts, representing
    $5.7 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require the Company to
    purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their
    obligations. The majority of land and lots under contract are
    currently expected to be purchased within three years, based on
    the Company’s assumptions as to the extent it will exercise
    its options to purchase such land and lots.

Other
    Commitments

In the normal course of its business activities, the Company
    provides standby letters of credit and surety bonds, issued by
    third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. At
    September 30, 2010, the Company had outstanding letters of
    credit of $51.7 million, all of which were cash
    collateralized, and surety bonds of $806.9 million. The
    Company has secured letter of credit agreements with five banks
    that require it to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the
    balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the
    issuing banks. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the amount
    of cash restricted for this purpose totaled $52.6 million
    and $53.3 million, respectively, and is included in
    homebuilding restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

The Company leases office space and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum annual lease payments
    under these leases at September 30, 2010 approximate (in

    SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s 33 homebuilding operating divisions and its
    financial services operation are its operating segments. The
    homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six
    reporting segments and the financial services operating segment
    is its own reporting segment. The Company’s reportable
    homebuilding segments are: East, Midwest, Southeast, South
    Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have
    homebuilding operations located in the following states:

East:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, New Mexico (Las Cruces only), Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, a change in the
    composition of the Company’s operating divisions required
    that the Las Cruces, New Mexico market, previously included in
    the Southwest reporting segment, now be included in the South
    Central reporting segment. Consequently, the Company has
    restated the prior year segment information provided in this
    note to conform to the current year presentation.

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating
    approximately 98% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008. The Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily
    engaged in the acquisition and development of land and the
    construction and sale of residential homes on the land, in
    26 states and 72 markets in the United States. The
    homebuilding segments generate most of their revenues from the
    sale of completed homes, and to a lesser extent from the sale of
    land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage
    financing and title agency services principally to customers of
    the Company’s homebuilding segments. The Company generally
    does not retain or service the mortgages that it originates;
    rather, it seeks to sell the mortgages and related servicing
    rights to third-party purchasers. The financial services segment
    generates its revenues from originating and selling mortgages
    and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing
    services.

Expenses maintained at the
    corporate level consist primarily of interest and property
    taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or
    expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating the
    Company’s corporate office. The amortization of capitalized
    interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based
    on the segment’s revenue, while the interest expensed
    directly and those expenses associated with the corporate office
    are allocated to each segment based on the segment’s
    average inventory.

In the past, the Company experienced variability in its results
    of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature
    of its homebuilding business. Historically, the Company has
    closed a greater number of homes in the third and fourth (June
    and September) fiscal quarters than in the first and second
    (December and March) fiscal quarters. As a result, revenues and
    net income typically have been higher in the third and fourth
    quarters of the fiscal year. In contrast to the typical seasonal
    results, the weakness in homebuilding market conditions during
    the past several years has mitigated these historical seasonal
    variations. In fiscal 2009 and 2010, just over half (54%) of
    consolidated revenues were attributable to operations in the
    third and fourth fiscal quarters, and the Company incurred
    operating losses in all quarters of fiscal 2009 and in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Net income in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010 includes a $149.2 million benefit from
    income taxes.

Gross profit during fiscal 2010 was reduced by inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs of $1.2 million, $2.4 million,
    $30.3 million and $30.8 million in the first, second,
    third and fourth quarters, respectively. Gross profit during
    fiscal 2009 was reduced by inventory impairment charges and
    write-offs of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs
    of $56.2 million, $48.1 million, $110.8 million
    and $192.5 million in the first, second, third and fourth
    quarters, respectively.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that
    evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or
    otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed
    in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2010 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal
    control over financial reporting is a process to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
    limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
    concluded that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2010.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010,
    as stated in their report included herein.
