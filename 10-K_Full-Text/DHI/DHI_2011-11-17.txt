    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2011 ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is one of the largest homebuilding companies
    in the United States. We construct and sell homes through our
    operating divisions in 25 states and 73 metropolitan
    markets of the United States, primarily under the name of D.R.
    Horton,

America’s Builder

. Our common stock is
    included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York
    Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless
    the context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R.
    Horton,” the “Company,” “we” and
    “our” used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In
    1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and
    businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential
    home construction and development companies owned or controlled
    by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public
    offering of our common stock. Our company’s growth over the
    years was achieved by investing available capital into our
    existing homebuilding markets and into

start-up

operations in new markets. Additionally, we acquired other
    homebuilding companies, which strengthened our position in
    existing markets and expanded our geographic presence and
    product offerings in other markets. Our homes generally range in
    size from 1,000 to 4,000 square feet and in price from
    $90,000 to $600,000. The current downturn in our industry has
    resulted in a substantial decrease in the size of our operations
    during the last five fiscal years as we have adapted to the
    significantly weakened new homes market. For the year ended
    September 30, 2011, we closed 16,695 homes with an average
    closing sales price of approximately $212,200.

Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage
    financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our
    homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    provides mortgage financing services principally to the
    purchasers of homes we build. We generally do not retain or
    service the mortgages we originate but, rather, seek to sell the
    mortgages and related servicing rights to third-party
    purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with
    purchaser guidelines and historically has sold substantially all
    of its mortgage production within 30 days of origination.
    Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents
    by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
    services, primarily to the purchasers of our homes.

Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding
    segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding
    operations are the most substantial part of our business,
    comprising approximately 98% of consolidated revenues, which
    totaled $3.6 billion in fiscal 2011. Our homebuilding
    operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of
    completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and
    lots. In addition to building traditional single-family detached
    homes, we also build attached homes, such as town homes,
    duplexes, triplexes and condominiums (including some mid-rise
    buildings), which share common walls and roofs. The sale of
    detached homes generated approximately 88%, 86%, and 81% of home
    sales revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our
    financial services segment generates its revenues from
    originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title
    insurance agency and closing services.

    Internet website all of our reports required to be filed with

Operating
    Strategy and Structure

For a substantial part of our company’s existence, we
    maintained significant

year-over-year

growth and profitability. We achieved this growth through an
    operating strategy focused on capturing greater market share,
    while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. To execute our
    strategy, we invested available capital in our existing
    homebuilding markets and opportunistically entered new markets.
    We also actively evaluated homebuilding acquisition
    opportunities as they arose, some of which resulted in
    acquisitions and contributed to our growth.

For the past five years, conditions in the homebuilding industry
    have been challenging. During this time, we have reduced our
    SG&A cost structure, rebid the costs in our homes,
    redesigned our product to be more efficient to build, reduced
    our homes under construction to more closely match current
    demand and enforced very conservative land and lot inventory
    investment guidelines. We have generated significant cash from
    operations by reducing our land inventory, our homes under
    construction and our mortgage loans held for sale, and from
    income tax refunds. We used this cash to reduce our outstanding
    notes payable and to increase our cash balances. As a result of
    all of these actions, we have a strong liquidity position and
    have improved our balance sheet leverage, both on a gross and
    net basis, from the beginning of the housing downturn. We will
    continue to conservatively manage our business, and our
    liquidity and balance sheet strength provide us with flexibility
    in determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of
    our communities and markets to strike the best balance between
    cash flow generation and potential profit.

Geographic
    Diversity

From inception to 1987, our homebuilding activities were
    conducted in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We then
    diversified geographically by entering additional markets, both
    through

start-up

operations and acquisitions. We now operate in 25 states
    and 73 markets. This provides us with geographic diversification
    in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of
    revenues and earnings. We believe our diversification strategy
    helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic
    cycles and enhances our long-term potential.

Economies
    of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in
    terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2011. By the same
    measure, we are also one of the five largest builders in many of
    our markets in fiscal 2011. We believe that our national,
    regional and local scale of operations has provided us with
    benefits that may not be available in the same degree to some
    other smaller homebuilders, such as:

•

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national,
    regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates
    from certain subcontractors;

•

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities,
    which allows us greater flexibility to compete for greater
    market share in each of our markets; and

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong
    balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships.



Decentralized
    Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating
    flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key
    operating decisions. At September 30, 2011, we had 29
    separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate
    in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division
    consists of a division president; land entitlement, acquisition
    and development personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel;
    a construction manager and construction superintendents;
    customer service personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager
    and office staff. We believe that division presidents and their
    management teams, who are familiar with local conditions,
    generally have better information on which to base decisions
    regarding their operations. Our division presidents receive
    performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and
    operational measures related to their operating divisions.

Operating
    Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other governmental
    requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite work
    required to meet local building codes;

•

Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction
    approvals;

•

Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their
    work meets our contracted scopes;

•

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•

Selecting construction subcontractors and ensuring their work
    meets our contracted scopes;

•

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules;

•

Developing and implementing local marketing plans; and

•

Coordinating post-closing customer service and warranty repairs.

Centralized
    Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business
    through our regional and corporate offices. We have four
    separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional
    office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief
    financial officer, a purchasing manager and limited office
    support staff. Each of our region presidents and their
    management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations
    of certain homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division president
    compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are
    responsible for establishing our operational policies and
    internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with
    established policies and controls



throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary
    responsibility for direct management of certain key risk
    elements and initiatives through the following centralized
    functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to
    our operating divisions;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Accounting and management reporting;

•

Internal audit;

•

Information technology systems;

•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Monitoring and analysis of margins, expenses and
    profitability; and

•

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of
    results.

Cost
    Management

We control overhead costs by centralizing certain administrative
    and accounting functions and by closely monitoring the number of
    administrative personnel and management positions in our
    operating divisions, as well as in our regional and corporate
    offices. We also seek to efficiently manage our advertising
    costs by directing many of our promotional activities toward
    local real estate brokers.

We control construction costs by striving to design our homes
    efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction
    materials and labor. We also seek to negotiate favorable pricing
    from our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the
    volume of services and products we purchase from them on a
    local, regional and national basis. We monitor our construction
    costs on each house as well as our inventory levels, margins,
    expenses and profitability through our management information
    systems.

Acquisitions

We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and
    liquidity position; however, we will continue to evaluate
    opportunities for strategic acquisitions or expansions of our
    operations. We believe that the current housing industry
    downturn may provide us selected opportunities to enhance our
    operations through the acquisition of existing homebuilding
    companies or distressed real estate properties at attractive
    valuations. In certain instances, such acquisitions can provide
    us benefits not found in

start-up

operations, such as: established land positions and inventories;
    and existing relationships with municipalities, land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers. We seek to limit the
    risks associated with acquiring other companies and distressed
    real estate properties by conducting extensive operational,
    financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by
    performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition
    will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable
    period of time.



Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic
    regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our
    mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our
    homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six
    reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which
    comprise the markets below. Our financial statements contain
    additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for
    purposes of capital allocation, we consider local,
    market-specific factors, including among others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Employment levels and job growth;

•

Income level of potential homebuyers;

•

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products
    utilized;

•

Market for homes at our targeted price points;

•

Availability of land and lots on acceptable terms;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

New and secondary home sales activity;

•

Competition; and

•

Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing.

Land
    Policies

We acquire land after we have completed due diligence and
    generally after we have obtained the rights (known as
    entitlements) to begin development or construction work
    resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we
    acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other things,
    complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests,
    independent environmental studies and other engineering work,
    and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other
    governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
    property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop
    land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we also
    sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we
    have excess land and lot positions.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain
    the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots
    at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
    anticipated home closings or planned development. Our option
    contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial
    exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and lot
    sellers and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs incurred by
    us. This enables us to control land and lot positions with
    limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the
    risks associated with land ownership and development.

Almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly
    by us. We have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements
    due to their increased costs and complexity, as well as the loss
    of operational control inherent in such arrangements. We are a
    party to a very small number of joint ventures that were
    acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders. All of
    these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial
    statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory
    risks by:

•

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned)
    in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing
    preferences and related economic developments, such as new job
    opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income
    trends;

•

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•

Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready
    for home construction;

•

Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts,
    where possible;



•

Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional
    upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s
    receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory
    deposits from the buyer; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes
    under construction without an executed sales contract) built in
    each subdivision.

Construction

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets
    to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each
    community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features
    to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to
    allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold. We
    continually adjust our product offerings to address our
    customers’ expectations for affordability, home size and
    features.

Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
    subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a
    competitive bidding process and retained for a specific
    subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
    subcontractor to complete construction at an

agreed-upon

price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use
    generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with
    other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials
    and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ construction
    superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate
    in major design and building decisions, coordinate the
    activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of
    subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor
    compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our
    construction superintendents play a significant role in working
    with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home
    modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction
    process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Construction time for our homes depends on the weather,
    availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home,
    and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a
    home within three to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of
    construction materials, except for work in progress materials
    for homes under construction. Generally, the construction
    materials used in our operations are readily available from
    numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
    certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
    at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
    have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of
    materials or labor that have materially affected our
    consolidated operating results.

Marketing
    and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and
    independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales
    from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each
    subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for
    sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel
    assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor
    plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting
    them with the selection of options and other custom features. We
    train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of
    financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising
    plans. As our customers are typically first-time or

move-up

homebuyers, we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing
    within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable. As
    market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers
    with one or more of a variety of incentives, including discounts
    and free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market.

We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers
    and real estate brokers in our local markets through electronic
    media, including email, social networking sites and our company
    Internet website, as well as brochures, flyers, newsletters and
    promotional events. We also use billboards, radio, television
    and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market. To
    minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate in
    subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take
    advantage of local traffic patterns. We believe



that model homes play a substantial role in our marketing
    efforts and therefore expend significant effort to create an
    attractive atmosphere in our model homes.

We also build a limited number of speculative homes in most of
    our subdivisions. These homes enhance our marketing and sales
    efforts to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these
    markets, as well as to independent brokers, who often represent
    homebuyers requiring a completed home within a short time frame.
    We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based
    on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of
    job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current
    sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in
    the market. We expect to maintain a level of speculative home
    inventory in our markets based on our current and planned sales
    pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an
    ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes help to
    provide us with opportunities to sell additional homes at a
    profit and generate positive returns and cash flows on our
    inventory of owned lots.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which
    varies in amount among our markets and subdivisions.
    Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional
    deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their
    homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers
    cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain
    their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating
    divisions occasionally choose to refund the deposit. Our sales
    contracts also include a financing contingency which permits
    customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if
    they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified
    interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may
    include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing
    home. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of
    sales contracts in fiscal 2011 were 27%, compared to 26% in
    fiscal 2010. The length of time between the signing of a sales
    contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer
    (closing) is generally from two to six months.

Customer
    Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality
    control inspections and responding to customers’
    post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous
    response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction
    reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for
    quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat
    and referral business from the real estate community and
    homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year
    limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such
    as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited
    warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited
    warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors
    who perform the actual construction also provide us with
    warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond
    to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some
    of our suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on
    specified products installed in the home.

Sales
    Order Backlog

At September 30, 2011, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $1,036.2 million (4,854 homes), an increase of
    22% from $850.8 million (4,128 homes) at September 30,
    2010. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $213,500
    at September 30, 2011, up 4% from the $206,100 average at
    September 30, 2010. Sales order backlog represents homes
    under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many
    of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to
    contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers
    selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations.
    A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in
    closings due to cancellations. Substantially all of the homes in
    our sales backlog at September 30, 2011 are scheduled to
    close in fiscal year 2012. Further discussion of our backlog is
    provided in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    under Part II of this annual report on

Form 10-K.



Customer
    Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage
    coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that
    mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place
    in a timely and efficient manner. DHI Mortgage originates
    mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers.
    During the year ended September 30, 2011, approximately 85%
    of DHI Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by
    our homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage provided mortgage
    financing services for approximately 61% of our total homes
    closed.

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI
    Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to
    third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage generally sells the loans
    and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly
    after origination with limited recourse provisions. In markets
    where we currently do not provide mortgage financing, we work
    with a variety of mortgage lenders that make available to
    homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs.

Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title
    insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance
    policies, examination and closing services primarily to the
    purchasers of homes we build and sell. We currently assume
    little or no underwriting risk associated with these title
    policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2011, we employed 3,010 persons, of
    whom 804 were sales and marketing personnel, 959 were executive,
    administrative and clerical personnel, 619 were involved in
    construction and 628 worked in mortgage and title operations. We
    believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with
    numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for
    homebuyers, desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor,
    employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with
    resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market.
    Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design,
    mortgage financing terms and location. Our competition remains
    intense with other homebuilders, especially as to pricing and
    incentives. Additionally, the large number of foreclosed homes
    being offered for sale creates competition for homebuyers and
    negatively affects pricing. Our financial services business
    competes with other mortgage lenders, including national,
    regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial
    institutions, many of which have greater access to capital,
    different lending criteria and potentially broader product
    offerings.

Governmental
    Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex
    regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
    zoning, density and development requirements, building,
    environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules
    and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect the
    development process, as well as building materials to be used,
    building designs and minimum elevation of properties. Our homes
    are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes
    eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal
    Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veterans Administration
    (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often
    provide broad discretion to the administering governmental
    authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be
    subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and
    other public improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of
    local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
    vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
    the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.



Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must comply
    with various federal and state laws and regulations. These
    include eligibility and other requirements for participation in
    the programs offered by the FHA, VA, Government National
    Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal National Mortgage
    Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation (Freddie Mac). These also include required
    compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations
    such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against
    discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. These laws
    and regulations subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Prior to
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry which began to
    affect our seasonal patterns in fiscal 2007, we generally had
    more homes under construction, closed more homes and had greater
    revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters
    of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased our working
    capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the
    third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding
    requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial
    services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of
    seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and
    financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are
    not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

Although the weakness in homebuilding market conditions
    mitigated our historical seasonal variations in recent years,
    our home closings and income before income taxes were higher in
    the second half of fiscal 2011 than in the first half of the
    year. However, given the current uncertain outlook for market
    conditions we can make no assurances as to whether this pattern
    will continue beyond the current fiscal year.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

should be read together with the risk factors set forth below.
    They describe various risks and uncertainties we are or may
    become subject to, many of which are difficult to predict or
    beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties, together with
    other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the
    potential to affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material
    and adverse manner.

The
    homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn, and
    its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain. Continued
    weakness or further deterioration in industry conditions or in
    the broader economic conditions could have additional adverse
    effects on our business and financial results.

The downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its fifth year,
    and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in
    U.S. history. The significant declines in the demand for
    new homes, oversupply of homes on the market and reductions in
    the availability of financing for homebuyers that have marked
    the downturn are continuing. During the downturn, we have
    experienced material reductions in our home sales and
    homebuilding revenues, and we have incurred material asset
    impairments and write-offs.

Our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by
    adverse industry and economic conditions. The significant number
    of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and driven
    down prices, making the purchase of a foreclosed home an
    alternative to purchasing a new home as well as negatively
    affecting appraisal comparisons for mortgage financing.
    Homebuilders have responded to declining sales and increased
    cancellation rates with significant concessions. With the
    decline in the values of homes and the inability of some
    homeowners to make their mortgage payments, the credit markets
    have been significantly disrupted, putting strains on many
    households and businesses. In the face of these conditions, the
    overall economy has remained very weak, with high unemployment
    levels and substantially reduced consumer spending and
    confidence. As a result, demand for new homes remains at
    historically low levels.

These challenging conditions are complex and interrelated. We
    cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity. Nor can we
    provide assurance that our responses to the homebuilding
    downturn or the government’s attempts to address the
    troubles in the overall economy will be successful.



Constriction
    of the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital
    and increase our costs of capital.

During the downturn in the homebuilding industry, we generated
    substantial operating cash flow, and we have relied principally
    on our cash on hand to meet our working capital needs and repay
    outstanding indebtedness. The downturn and the constriction of
    the credit markets have reduced some of the other sources of
    liquidity available to us. There likely will be periods when
    financial market upheaval will limit our ability to access the
    public debt markets or obtain bank financing, or doing so will
    increase our cost of capital.

Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, uses a mortgage
    repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates.
    The facility must be renewed annually, and the current facility
    expires in March 2012. A continuation of current market
    conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result
    in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its
    committed availability. Such conditions may also make it more
    difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate.

We believe we can meet our capital requirements in the next
    12 months with our existing cash resources. However, we can
    provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so,
    particularly if current industry or economic conditions continue
    or deteriorate further. The future effects on our business,
    liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be
    material and adverse, both in ways described above and in other
    ways that we do not currently foresee.

We use letters of credit and surety bonds to secure our
    performance under various construction and land development
    agreements, escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other
    arrangements. Should our future performance or economic
    conditions make these more difficult to obtain or more costly,
    our business or financial results could be adversely affected.

The
    reduction in availability of mortgage financing has adversely
    affected our business, and the duration and ultimate severity of
    the effects are uncertain.

Over the last five fiscal years, the mortgage lending industry
    has experienced significant change and contraction. Credit
    requirements have tightened and investor demand for mortgage
    loans and mortgage-backed securities has been limited to
    securities backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. This
    has made it more difficult for many buyers to finance the
    purchase of our homes, thus reducing the pool of qualified
    homebuyers. These reductions in demand have adversely affected
    our business and financial results, and the duration and
    severity of these effects remain uncertain.

We believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie
    Mac and Ginnie Mae to the mortgage industry has been very
    important to the housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
    required substantial injections of capital from the federal
    government and may require additional government support in the
    future. In addition, increased lending volume and losses insured
    by the FHA have resulted in a reduction of its insurance fund.
    Any reduction in the availability of the financing provided by
    these institutions could adversely affect interest rates,
    mortgage availability and sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

The FHA insures mortgage loans that generally have lower credit
    requirements and as a result, continue to be a particularly
    important source for financing the sale of our homes. In the
    last three years, more restrictive guidelines have been placed
    on FHA insured loans, affecting minimum down payment and
    availability for condominium financing. In the near future,
    further restrictions are expected on FHA insured loans,
    including but not limited to additional limitations on
    seller-paid closing costs and concessions. This or any other
    restriction may negatively affect the availability or
    affordability of FHA financing, which could adversely affect our
    ability to sell homes.

While the use of down payment assistance programs by our
    homebuyers has decreased significantly, some of our customers
    still utilize 100% financing through programs offered by the VA
    and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). There can be
    no assurance that these programs or other programs will continue
    to be available or will be as attractive to our customers as the
    programs currently offered, which could negatively affect our
    sales.



The mortgage loans originated by our financial services
    operation are sold to third-party purchasers. An entity which
    has historically purchased a substantial volume of mortgage
    loans from us has recently announced that they are exiting this
    line of business. If we are unable to sell to additional viable
    purchasers in the marketplace, our ability to originate and sell
    mortgage loans at competitive prices could be limited which
    would negatively affect our profitability.

Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in
    the availability of mortgage products may make it more difficult
    for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers who
    need financing.

Mortgage rates are currently at historically low levels. If
    interest rates increase, the costs of owning a home will be
    affected and could result in further reductions in the demand
    for our homes.

Our
    strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the
    homebuilding industry have had limited success, and the
    continued implementation of these and other strategies may not
    be successful.

We have been successful in increasing our liquidity by
    generating positive operating cash flow and reducing our
    leverage during the downturn. However, during this time,
    notwithstanding our sales strategies, we continued to experience
    a low level of sales demand and an elevated rate of sales
    contract cancellations. We believe this is largely due to
    reduced homebuyer confidence, due principally to the weak
    economy and the continuing high level of unemployment. A more
    restrictive mortgage lending environment and the inability of
    some buyers to sell their existing homes have also impacted our
    sales orders. Many of these factors, which affect new sales and
    cancellation rates, are beyond our control. It is uncertain how
    long the low sales level and elevated level of cancellations
    will continue. If these conditions continue for a protracted
    period, it is not clear whether our strategies will succeed in
    maintaining or increasing our sales volume or our current
    margins.

Our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected by
    significant inflation or deflation.

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land,
    materials and labor. In the event of a return of significant
    inflation, we may seek to increase the sales prices of homes in
    order to maintain satisfactory margins. However, a continuation
    of the oversupply of homes relative to demand may make this
    difficult. In addition, significant inflation is often
    accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative
    impact on housing demand. In such an environment, we may not be
    able to raise home prices sufficiently to keep up with the rate
    of inflation and our margins could decrease. Moreover, with
    inflation, the costs of capital increase and the purchasing
    power of our cash resources can decline. Current or future
    efforts by the government to stimulate the economy may increase
    the risk of significant inflation and its adverse impact on our
    business or financial results.

Alternatively, a significant period of deflation could cause a
    decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. This could
    lead to a further deterioration in economic conditions,
    including an increase in the rate of unemployment. Deflation
    could also cause the value of our inventories to decline or
    reduce the value of existing homes below the related mortgage
    loan balance, which could potentially increase the supply of
    existing homes and have a negative impact on our results of
    operations.

The
    homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in
    general economic, real estate or other business conditions that
    could adversely affect our business or financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly
    affected by changes in industry conditions, as well as changes
    in general and local economic conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

consumer confidence;

•

levels of new and existing homes for sale;



•

demographic trends; and

•

housing demand.

These may occur on a national scale, like the current downturn,
    or may affect some of our regions or markets more than others.
    When adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets, they
    could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some
    other homebuilding companies. Our operations in previously
    strong markets, particularly California, Florida, Nevada and
    Arizona, have more adversely affected our financial results than
    our other markets in the current downturn.

An oversupply of alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed
    homes, homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other
    existing homes and rental properties, can also reduce our
    ability to sell new homes, depress new home prices and reduce
    our margins on the sales of new homes. High levels of
    foreclosures not only contribute to additional inventory
    available for sale, but also reduce appraisal valuations for new
    homes and the amount that can be financed, potentially resulting
    in lower sales prices.

Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes,
    tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, volcanic activity, droughts,
    and floods, can harm our homebuilding business. These can delay
    home closings, adversely affect the cost or availability of
    materials or labor, or damage homes under construction. The
    climates and geology of many of the states in which we operate,
    including California, Florida and Texas, where we have some of
    our larger operations, present increased risks of adverse
    weather or natural disasters.

Continued military deployments to foreign regions, terrorist
    attacks, other acts of violence or threats to national security
    and any corresponding response by the United States or others,
    or related domestic or international instability may adversely
    affect general economic conditions or cause a slowdown of the
    economy.

As a result of the foregoing matters, potential customers may be
    less willing or able to buy our homes. Because of weak industry
    and economic conditions, we have generally not been able to
    increase the sale prices of our homes in recent years. In the
    future, our pricing strategies may also be limited by market
    conditions. We may be unable to further change the mix of our
    home offerings, reduce the costs of the homes we build or offer
    more affordable homes to maintain our margins or satisfactorily
    address changing market conditions in other ways. In addition,
    cancellations of home sales contracts in backlog may increase as
    homebuyers choose to not honor their contracts due to any of the
    factors discussed above.

Our financial services business is closely related to our
    homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans
    principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in
    the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may
    also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of
    our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages
    we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the
    mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages
    or may increase our repurchase or other obligations for previous
    originations. We establish reserves related to mortgages we have
    sold; however, actual future obligations related to these
    mortgages could differ significantly from our currently
    estimated amounts.

The
    risks associated with our land and lot inventory could adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

Inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business.
    The risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing
    land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. Thus, we
    may have acquired options on or bought and developed land or
    lots at a cost we will not be able to recover fully, or on which
    we cannot build and sell homes profitably. As a result, our
    deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar
    contracts may be put at risk. The value of our owned undeveloped
    land, building lots and housing inventories can also fluctuate
    significantly as a result of changing market conditions. In
    addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can
    result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing
    community or market. During the current economic downturn, we
    have sold homes and land for lower margins or at a loss and we
    have recorded significant inventory impairment charges.

Our levels of owned and controlled land and building lots are
    based on management’s expectations for future volume
    growth. In light of the much weaker market conditions
    encountered since fiscal 2006, we have



significantly slowed our purchases of undeveloped land and our
    development spending on land we own. We made substantial land
    and lot sales in fiscal 2008. Throughout the downturn, we also
    terminated numerous land option contracts and wrote off earnest
    money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to these option
    contracts. Because future market conditions are uncertain, we
    cannot provide assurance that these measures will be successful
    in managing our future inventory risks.

Supply
    shortages and other risks related to demand for building
    materials and skilled labor could increase our costs and delay
    deliveries.

The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced
    significant difficulties that can affect the cost or timing of
    construction, including:

•

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building
    at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers
    want to live;

•

shortages of qualified trades people;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, manufacturers and distributors
    who may be inadequately capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly
    increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are
    significant components of home construction costs.

These factors may cause us to take longer or incur more costs to
    build our homes and adversely affect our revenues and margins.

Increases
    in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers
    from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or
    financial results.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage
    interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible
    expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases
    state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under
    current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state
    government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed
    from time to time, to eliminate or substantially modify these
    income tax deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home
    would increase for many of our potential customers. The loss or
    reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law changes
    were enacted without offsetting provisions, would adversely
    impact demand for and sales prices of new homes.

In addition, increases in property tax rates by local
    governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced
    federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
    potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to
    purchase new homes.

Governmental
    regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability
    of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect
    land development and home construction, including zoning,
    density restrictions, building design and building standards.
    These regulations often provide broad discretion to the
    administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we
    must meet prior to development or construction being approved,
    if approved at all. We are subject to determinations by these
    authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities,
    roads or other local services. New housing developments may also
    be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets
    and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets
    government authorities have implemented no growth or growth
    control initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay or increase
    the costs of development or home construction.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal
    laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and
    the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies
    depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining
    properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where
    undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available.
    These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur



substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs,
    and can prohibit or severely restrict development and
    homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or
    areas.

Governmental
    regulation of our financial services operations could adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

Our financial services operations are subject to numerous
    federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include
    eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan
    programs, compliance with consumer lending and similar
    requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions
    against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures.
    They may also subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies. These factors may limit our ability to
    provide mortgage financing or title services to potential
    purchasers of our homes.

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
    Protection Act (H.R.4173) was signed into law. This legislation
    provides for a number of new requirements relating to
    residential mortgage lending practices, many of which are to be
    developed further by implementing rules. These include, among
    others, minimum standards for mortgages and lender practices in
    making mortgages, limitations on certain fees and incentive
    arrangements, retention of credit risk and remedies for
    borrowers in foreclosure proceedings. The effect of such
    provisions on our financial services business will depend on the
    rules that are ultimately enacted. Key decisions that have yet
    to be made concern the characteristics of mortgages that would
    be exempt from risk retention, how risk retention requirements
    will be implemented and how derivative trading will be impacted.
    These factors could restrict the availability of and increase
    the cost of mortgage credit in addition to increasing the
    general and administrative costs within our financial services
    operations.

The turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults and
    resulting foreclosures has encouraged consumer lawsuits and the
    investigation of financial services industry practices by
    governmental authorities. These investigations could include the
    examination of consumer lending practices, sales of mortgages to
    financial institutions and other investors, and current
    foreclosure processes or other practices in the financial
    services segments of homebuilding companies. We are unable to
    assess whether these governmental inquiries will result in
    changes in regulations, homebuilding industry practices or
    adversely affect the costs and potential profitability of
    homebuilding companies.

Homebuilding
    is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in
    the ordinary course of business that can be
    significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and
    construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability
    insurance, and we obtain indemnities and certificates of
    insurance from subcontractors covering claims related to their
    workmanship and materials. We establish warranty and other
    reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in
    our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated
    with the types of homes built. Because of the uncertainties
    inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our
    insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our
    reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and
    construction defect claims in the future. Contractual
    indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible
    for applicable self-insured retentions and some types of claims
    may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable
    coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the
    availability of product liability insurance for construction
    defects is currently limited and costly. We have responded to
    increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent
    years by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim
    reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be
    further restricted or become more costly.

Our
    debt obligations could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

As of September 30, 2011, our consolidated debt was
    $1,704.6 million. As of September 30, 2011, other than
    the expiration of the mortgage repurchase facility in March
    2012, there are no scheduled maturities of principal on our
    outstanding public debt during the next 12 months. The
    indentures governing our senior and convertible senior notes do
    not restrict the incurrence of future unsecured debt, and they
    permit significant



amounts of secured debt. We do not currently have a revolving
    credit facility for our homebuilding operations. If we choose to
    enter into a new line of credit agreement, it may limit the
    amount of debt we could incur.

Possible Consequences.

The amount and the
    maturities of our debt could have important consequences. For
    example, they could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payment of our debt and reduce our ability to
    use our cash flow for other operating or investing purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the
    changes in our business;

•

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements or other requirements;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt
    than some of our competitors; and

•

make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or general
    economic conditions.

In addition, the magnitude of our debt and the restrictions
    imposed by the instruments governing these obligations expose us
    to additional risks, including:

Dependence on Future Performance.

Our ability
    to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend, in
    part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results
    are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this
    report. These have been compounded by the current industry and
    economic conditions. Our revenues and earnings vary with the
    level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our
    businesses are also affected by financial, political, business
    and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
    factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect
    our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through
    the sale of debt or equity, the refinancing of debt, or the sale
    of assets.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility and Other
    Restrictions.

The mortgage repurchase facility
    for our mortgage subsidiary requires the maintenance of a
    minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable ratio
    of debt to tangible net worth and a minimum level of liquidity
    by our mortgage subsidiary. A failure to comply with these
    requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the
    availability of funds to the financial services subsidiaries or
    cause their debt to become due and payable prior to maturity.
    Any difficulty experienced in complying with these covenants
    could make the renewal of the facility more difficult or costly.

In addition, although our financial services business is
    conducted through subsidiaries that are not restricted by our
    indentures, the ability of our financial services subsidiaries
    to provide funds to our homebuilding operations is subject to
    restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility. These funds
    would not be available to us upon the occurrence and during the
    continuance of defaults under this facility. Moreover, our right
    to receive assets from these subsidiaries upon their liquidation
    or recapitalization will be subject to the prior claims of the
    creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims we may have to funds
    from this segment would be subordinate to subsidiary
    indebtedness to the extent of any security for such indebtedness
    and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as senior to our
    claims.

The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on
    the creation of secured debt and liens.

Changes in Debt Ratings.

Our senior unsecured
    debt is currently rated at below investment grade. Any lowering
    of our debt ratings could make entering into a new line of
    credit agreement or accessing the public capital markets more
    difficult

and/or

more
    expensive.

Change of Control Purchase Options.

If a
    change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing
    $455.5 million principal amount of our senior notes as of
    September 30, 2011, we would be required to offer to
    purchase these notes at 101% of their principal amount, together
    with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If a fundamental
    change, including a change of control, occurs as defined in the
    indenture governing our convertible senior notes, which
    constituted $500 million principal amount as of
    September 30, 2011, we would be required to offer to
    purchase these notes at par, together with all accrued



and unpaid interest, if any. If purchase offers were required
    under the indentures for these notes, we can give no assurance
    that we would have sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we
    would be required to purchase.

Potential Future Restrictions.

We do not
    currently have a revolving line of credit in place. However, if
    we decide to enter into a revolving credit agreement in the
    future, it is likely that we would become subject to further
    restrictions on our operations and activities.

Homebuilding
    and financial services are very competitive industries, and
    competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or
    financial results.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders
    compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable
    properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We
    compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders,
    often within larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed
    by such homebuilders. We also compete with existing home sales,
    foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions
    in the homebuilding industry can negatively impact our sales
    volumes, selling prices and incentive levels, reduce our profit
    margins, and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or
    other assets. Competition can also hurt our ability to acquire
    suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable
    prices or terms, or cause delays in the construction of our
    homes.

Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks
    and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders with greater
    access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to
    offer more attractive financing to potential customers.

Our homebuilding and financial services businesses compete with
    other companies, both from within and outside of these
    industries, to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced
    employees, managers and executives. Competition for the services
    of these individuals will likely increase substantially as
    business conditions begin to stabilize or improve in the
    homebuilding and financial services industries or in the general
    economy. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees,
    managers or executives, our business could be adversely impacted.

We
    cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies
    will be successful or not expose us to additional
    risks.

Although we have focused on internal growth in recent years, we
    may in the future make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding
    companies or their assets. Successful strategic acquisitions
    require the integration of operations and management. Although
    we believe that we have been successful in the past, we can give
    no assurance that we would be able to successfully identify,
    acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders
    if we issue our common stock as consideration, or reduce our
    liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash. The
    impact on liquidity may be increased because we do not currently
    have a revolving credit facility. In addition, acquisitions can
    expose us to valuation risks, including the risk of writing off
    goodwill or impairing inventory and other assets related to such
    acquisitions. The risk of goodwill and other asset impairments
    increases during a cyclical housing downturn when our
    profitability may decline, as evidenced by the goodwill and
    other asset impairment charges we recognized in recent years. In
    addition, we may not be able to successfully implement our
    operating or internal growth strategies within our existing
    markets. In the uncertain current market conditions, asset
    acquisitions involve a risk that the markets involved may
    subsequently deteriorate. Conversely, if we delay an acquisition
    until we believe the market uncertainties are resolved, the
    potential competitive advantages of the acquisition may be
    limited.

We may
    not realize our deferred income tax asset.

As of September 30, 2011, we have a net deferred income tax
    asset of $848.5 million, against which we have provided a
    valuation allowance of $848.5 million. The realization of
    all or a portion of our deferred income tax asset is dependent
    upon the generation of future taxable income during the
    statutory carryforward periods and in the jurisdictions in which
    the related temporary differences become deductible.



The accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates
    of future results. Differences between the anticipated and
    actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a
    material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
    financial position. Changes in tax laws also affect actual tax
    results and the valuation of deferred income tax assets over
    time.

The
    utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if
    we experienced an ownership change as defined in the Internal
    Revenue Code.

We have experienced continuing tax net operating losses through
    fiscal 2011 and have potential unrealized built-in losses. These
    tax net operating losses have the potential to reduce future
    income tax obligations if we realize taxable income in the
    future. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code
    contains rules that limit the ability of a company that
    undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss
    carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years
    after the ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership
    change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of
    its stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in
    accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by
    focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered
    by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the
    stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from
    new issuances of stock by the company.

If we undergo an ownership change for purposes of
    Section 382 as a result of future transactions involving
    our common stock, both the amount of and our ability to use any
    of our net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit
    carryforwards or net unrealized built-in losses at the time of
    ownership change would be subject to the limitations of
    Section 382. In addition, these limitations may affect the
    expiration date of a portion of our built-in losses, any net
    operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards, and we
    may not be able to use them before they expire. This could
    adversely affect our financial position, results of operations
    and cash flow.

We do not believe we have experienced such an ownership change
    as of September 30, 2011; however, the amount by which our
    ownership may change in the future is affected by purchases and
    sales of stock by 5% stockholders; the potential conversion of
    our outstanding convertible senior notes and our decision as to
    whether to settle any such conversions completely or partially
    in stock; and new issuances of stock by us.

PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own
    several office buildings totaling approximately
    260,000 square feet, and we lease approximately
    720,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring
    through October 2015. These properties are located in our
    various operating markets to house our homebuilding and
    financial services operating divisions and our regional and
    corporate offices.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the
    ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such
    contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe
    that the liabilities arising from these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the
    liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves
    relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that
    could be significant.

In October 2010, the California Regional Water Quality Control
    Board (“Control Board”), Los Angeles Region, notified
    a subsidiary (the “Subsidiary”) of the Company of its
    intention to assess a penalty against the Subsidiary regarding a
    previously issued notice of violation (“NOV”). The NOV
    related to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
    permit (the “Permit”) obtained on the
    Subsidiary’s behalf in 2003 to develop a project in
    California. Without admitting any wrongdoing, the Subsidiary has
    settled this matter and paid an assessed penalty of
    approximately $172,500.

In August 2011, the Wage and Hour Division (“WHD”) of
    the U.S. Department of Labor notified the Company that it
    was initiating an investigation to determine the Company’s
    compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”)
    and, to the extent applicable, other laws enforced by WHD. The
    Company believes that its business practices are in compliance
    with the FLSA and other applicable laws enforced by WHD. At this
    time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of this
    investigation, nor can it reasonably estimate the potential
    costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution.
    Consequently, the Company has not recorded any associated
    liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations — Fiscal Year 2011 Overview

In fiscal 2011, conditions within the homebuilding industry
    remained challenging. Although the overall level of new home
    demand declined from the prior year as a result of the
    expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in April 2010, we
    saw some improvement in our net sales orders during the last
    half of fiscal 2011 compared to the last half of fiscal 2010.
    The number and value of our net sales orders were 2% and 8%
    higher, respectively, during the last six months of fiscal 2011
    than in the comparable period of fiscal 2010, and were 7% and
    13% higher, respectively, in the last three months of fiscal
    2011 than in the comparable period of fiscal 2010. In addition,
    during fiscal 2011 we experienced a more traditional demand
    pattern in our net sales orders, which sequentially increased
    from the first quarter to the second quarter, remained at a
    consistent level in the third quarter, then slowed in our fourth
    quarter. These results suggest that overall demand for new homes
    may be stabilizing, but we expect that demand is likely to
    remain at low levels for some time.

Our level of home closings in fiscal 2011 was essentially the
    same level that we achieved in fiscal 2009. However, our pre-tax
    income increased from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2011 by
    $569 million. While $397 million of the increase was
    due to reductions in inventory impairments and land option cost
    write-offs and mortgage recourse and reinsurance expenses
    recognized in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2009, the remaining
    increase of $172 million reflects the results of our
    strategies to open new communities, improve gross margins,
    adjust our SG&A costs to current revenue levels and reduce
    our outstanding debt levels and related interest expense.

Despite the continued low level of demand for new homes and the
    weak homebuilding industry conditions, our strong balance sheet
    and liquidity position is allowing us to invest in market
    opportunities as they arise. We believe we are well-positioned
    for an eventual housing recovery. We will continue to adjust our
    business strategies as necessary based on housing demand in each
    of our markets. Our future results could be negatively impacted
    by prolonged weakness in the economy, continued high levels of
    unemployment, a significant increase in mortgage interest rates
    or further tightening of mortgage lending standards.

We have evaluated our homebuilding and financial services assets
    for recoverability. Our assets whose recoverability is most
    impacted by market conditions include inventory, earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot
    option contracts, tax assets and owned mortgage loans. These
    assets collectively represented approximately 90% of our total
    assets, excluding cash and marketable securities, at
    September 30, 2011. Our evaluations incorporated our
    expectation of continued challenges in the homebuilding
    industry. Based on our evaluations, during fiscal 2011, we
    recorded inventory impairment charges of $37.3 million,
    wrote-off earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs
    related to land and lot option contracts we no longer plan to
    pursue of $8.1 million (net of recoveries), incurred
    charges of $11.6 million associated with mortgage loans
    held in portfolio and the limited recourse provisions on
    previously sold mortgage loans and incurred charges of
    $1.8 million related to mortgage reinsurance activities.



Strategy

It is difficult in the near term to predict if current
    homebuilding industry conditions will improve or if they will
    deteriorate. During the industry downturn, we generated
    significant cash flow from operations which we primarily used to
    increase our cash balances and reduce our outstanding debt. Our
    liquidity and reduced leverage provide us flexibility in
    determining the appropriate operating strategy for each of our
    communities and markets to strike the best balance between cash
    flow generation and potential profit. Our operating strategy
    continues to include the following initiatives:

•

Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position.

•

Managing the sales prices and level of sales incentives on our
    homes to optimize the balance of sales volumes, profits, returns
    on inventory investments and cash flows.

•

Entering into lot option contracts to purchase finished lots to
    potentially increase sales volumes and profitability.

•

Renegotiating existing lot option contracts to reduce lot costs
    and to better match the scheduled lot purchases with new home
    demand in each community.

•

Limiting land acquisition and development spending, especially
    in communities that require substantial investments of time or
    capital resources.

•

Managing our inventory of homes under construction by
    selectively starting construction on unsold homes to capture new
    home demand, while monitoring the number and aging of unsold
    homes and aggressively marketing unsold, completed homes in
    inventory.

•

Decreasing the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and
    subcontractors.

•

Modifying product offerings and pricing to meet consumer demand
    in each of our markets.

•

Controlling our SG&A infrastructure to match production
    levels.

Although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives
    will be successful, if market conditions do not deteriorate, we
    expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to
    achieve profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet
    and liquidity position in fiscal 2012.

Net
    Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders decreased 7%, to
    $3,727.6 million (17,421 homes) in 2011 from
    $4,011.0 million (19,375 homes) in 2010. The number of net
    sales orders decreased 10% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal
    2010. Sales order volume during the first part of fiscal 2010
    benefitted from the federal homebuyer tax credit. During the
    last half of fiscal 2011, the number and value of our net sales
    orders were 2% and 8% higher, respectively, than in the last
    half of fiscal 2010.

In comparing fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010, the value and volume of
    net sales orders decreased in most of our market regions, with
    much of the volume decrease resulting from the expiration of the
    federal homebuyer tax credit. The volume decline in our
    Southwest region also reflected weaker market conditions in all
    of its markets, combined with a reduction in the number of
    active communities in the current year. Our East and Southeast
    regions experienced slight increases in net sales orders as a
    result of operating more communities in the current fiscal year.
    Fluctuations in the value of net sales orders were primarily due
    to the change in the number of homes sold in each respective
    region and, to a lesser extent, to small fluctuations in the
    average selling price of those homes. Our future sales volumes
    will depend on the strength of the overall economy, employment
    levels and our ability to successfully implement our operating
    strategies in each of our markets.

The average price of our net sales orders in 2011 was $214,000,
    an increase of 3% from the $207,000 average in 2010. The largest
    percentage increases were in our Southwest and West regions and
    were primarily due to opening new communities and adjusting our
    product mix, with higher priced communities representing more of
    our sales. We continue to adjust our product mix, geographic mix
    and pricing within our homebuilding markets to respond to market
    conditions.

Our annual sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders
    divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 27% in fiscal
    2011, compared to 26% in fiscal 2010. This cancellation rate
    continues to be above historical levels and is reflective of low
    consumer confidence and tight mortgage lending standards. The
    return of our cancellation rate to historical levels depends
    largely on the strength of the overall economy and our ability
    to successfully implement our operating strategies in each of
    our markets.

Sales
    Order Backlog

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet
    closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our
    sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including
    mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes,
    which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in
    backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations, which
    have been substantial during the recent housing downturn.

Our homes in backlog increased 18% at September 30, 2011
    from the prior year, with significant increases in our East,
    Midwest and Southeast regions. The number of homes in backlog in
    these regions benefited from more active communities and
    improved third and fourth quarter sales as compared with the
    same periods of the prior year.

Home
    Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales decreased 18%, to $3,542.3 million
    (16,695 homes closed) in 2011 from $4,302.3 million (20,875
    homes closed) in 2010. The average selling price of homes closed
    during 2011 was $212,200, up 3% from the $206,100 average in
    2010 which reflects a change in product mix rather than broad
    price appreciation. During fiscal 2011, home sales revenues
    decreased in all of our market regions, resulting from decreases
    in the number of homes closed.

The number of homes closed in fiscal 2011 decreased 20% due to
    decreases in all of our market regions. The federal homebuyer
    tax credit helped stimulate demand for new homes during the
    prior year and following its expiration we experienced a
    significant decline in demand for our homes as reflected in our
    current year results. As conditions change in the housing
    markets in which we operate, our ongoing level of net sales
    orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of
    revenue we will generate.

Home
    Sales Gross Profit

Gross profit from home sales decreased by 23%, to
    $571.3 million in 2011, from $744.0 million in 2010,
    and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased
    120 basis points, to 16.1%. The reduction in gross profit
    from home sales was primarily due to the increased levels of
    incentives and discounts needed to sell homes in the current
    year, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and
    costs of our homes in most of our markets. The prior year
    benefitted from the federal homebuyer tax credit, which created
    demand for our homes without the need for us to provide as many
    incentives and discounts.

To the extent we utilize sales incentives and price adjustments
    to increase the level of home closings, gross profit percentages
    will continue to be impacted.

Land
    Sales Revenue

Land sales revenues decreased slightly to $7.3 million in
    2011, from $7.4 million in 2010. Fluctuations in revenues
    from land sales are a function of how we manage our inventory
    levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots
    with the intent to build and sell homes on them; however, we
    occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned
    parcels which we typically sell to commercial developers, and we
    also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land
    and lot supply. Land and lot sales occur at unpredictable
    intervals and varying degrees of profitability. Therefore, the
    revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period
    to period. As of September 30, 2011, we had
    $26.3 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell
    in the next twelve months.

Inventory
    Impairments and Land Option Cost Write-offs

During fiscal 2011, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and outlook for
    all of our communities, the assumptions utilized reflected our
    expectation of continued challenging conditions and
    uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets.
    As we continue to evaluate the strength of the economy (measured
    largely in terms of job growth), the level of underlying demand
    for new homes and our operating performance, the level of
    impairments in future quarters will fluctuate and may increase.
    As of September 30, 2011, we evaluated communities with a
    combined carrying value of $391.5 million for impairment.
    The analysis of the majority of these communities assumed that
    sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than
    current sales order prices in each community, or in comparable
    communities, in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate.
    For a minority of communities that we do not intend to develop
    or operate in current market conditions, some increases over
    current sales prices were assumed. While it is difficult to
    determine a timeframe for a given community in the current
    market conditions, we estimated the remaining lives of these
    communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years.
    In performing this analysis, we utilized a range of discount
    rates for communities of



12% to 18%. Through this evaluation process, we determined that
    communities with a carrying value of $37.1 million as of
    September 30, 2011, were impaired. As a result, during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded impairment charges of
    $10.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired
    communities to their estimated fair value, as compared to
    $29.1 million of impairment charges in the same period of
    2010. The fourth quarter charges combined with impairment
    charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory
    impairment charges of $37.3 million and $62.3 million
    during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

We generally perform our impairment analysis based on total
    inventory at the community level. When an impairment charge for
    a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each
    lot in the community in the same manner as land and development
    costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each
    community is categorized as construction in progress and
    finished homes, residential land and lots developed and under
    development, and land held for development, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development. During fiscal
    2011, approximately 78% of the impairment charges were recorded
    to residential land and lots and land held for development, and
    approximately 22% of the charges were recorded to construction
    in progress and finished homes inventory, compared to 93% and
    7%, respectively, in fiscal 2010.

Of the remaining $354.4 million carrying value of
    communities which were determined not to be impaired at
    September 30, 2011, the largest concentrations were in
    California (23%), Illinois (16%), Arizona (11%), Florida (10%)
    and Texas (9%). It is possible that our estimate of undiscounted
    cash flows from these communities may change and could result in
    a future need to record impairment charges to adjust the
    carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value.
    There are several factors which could lead to changes in the
    estimates of undiscounted future cash flows for a given
    community. The most significant of these include pricing and
    incentive levels actually realized by the community, the rate at
    which the homes are sold and the costs incurred to develop the
    lots and construct the homes. The pricing and incentive levels
    are often inter-related with sales pace within a community, such
    that a price reduction can typically be expected to increase the
    sales pace. Further, both of these factors are heavily
    influenced by the competitive pressures facing a given community
    from both new homes and existing homes, some of which may result
    from foreclosures. If conditions in the broader economy,
    homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate
    worsen, and as we re-evaluate specific community pricing and
    incentives, construction and development plans, and our overall
    land sale strategies, we may be required to evaluate additional
    communities or re-evaluate previously impaired communities for
    potential impairment. These evaluations may result in additional
    impairment charges.

Based on our quarterly reviews of land and lot option contracts,
    we have written off earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to contracts for land or lots which are not
    expected to be acquired. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we wrote
    off $8.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land
    option contracts. At September 30, 2011, outstanding
    earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and
    lot option purchase contracts totaled $14.6 million and
    pre-acquisition costs related to these contracts totaled
    $9.6 million.

The inventory impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding
    gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    approximately 130 basis points in fiscal 2011, compared to
    150 basis points in fiscal 2010.

A community may consist of land
    held for development, residential land and lots developed and
    under development, and construction in progress and finished
    homes. A particular community often includes inventory in more
    than one category. Further, a community may contain multiple
    parcels with varying product types (e.g. entry level and

move-up

single family detached, as well as attached product types). Some
    communities have no homes under construction, finished homes, or
    current home sales efforts or activity.



Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities decreased 8% to
    $480.0 million in 2011 from $523.2 million in 2010. As
    a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense
    increased 140 basis points, to 13.5% in 2011 from 12.1% in
    2010. The largest component of our homebuilding SG&A
    expense is employee compensation and related costs, which
    represented 60% and 58% of SG&A costs in 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. These costs decreased by 6%, to
    $286.5 million in 2011 from $304.0 million in 2010,
    primarily due to a decline in the level of incentive
    compensation and to a lesser extent, to a decline in the number
    of employees. Our homebuilding operations employed approximately
    2,380 and 2,500 employees at September 30, 2011 and
    2010, respectively. A reduction in advertising costs also
    contributed to the decline in SG&A expenses.

We continually attempt to adjust our SG&A infrastructure to
    support our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make
    assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or
    improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of
    revenues. It has become more difficult to reduce SG&A
    expense as the size of our operations has decreased. If revenues
    decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our SG&A,
    future SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues will
    increase.

Interest
    Incurred

Homebuilding interest costs are incurred on our homebuilding
    debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2011 with
    fiscal 2010, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt
    decreased 25% to $130.2 million, primarily due to a 26%
    decrease in our average homebuilding debt.

We capitalize homebuilding interest to inventory during active
    development and construction. Due to the decrease in the size of
    our operations, our inventory under active development and
    construction has been lower than our debt level; therefore, a
    portion of our interest incurred is expensed. We expensed
    $50.5 million of homebuilding interest during fiscal 2011,
    compared to $86.3 million of interest during fiscal 2010.
    The reduction in interest expensed in the current year is a
    result of a decline in interest incurred during the year.
    Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written
    off with inventory impairment charges, declined to 3.0% of total
    home and land/lot cost of sales in fiscal 2011 from 3.4% in 2010
    as a result of more home closings on acquired finished lots and
    decreases in construction times.

Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

During fiscal 2011, in addition to repaying maturing senior
    notes, we retired $319.2 million principal amount of our
    senior notes prior to their maturity, compared to
    $822.2 million in fiscal 2010. As a result of the early
    retirement of these notes, we recognized net losses of
    $10.8 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2011 and
    2010, respectively, which represent the difference between the
    principal amount of the notes and the aggregate purchase price
    plus any unamortized discounts and fees. The net loss in fiscal
    2011 includes a loss of $6.3 million for the call premium
    and write-off of unamortized fees related to the early
    redemption of the 5.375% senior notes due 2012. The net
    loss in fiscal 2010 includes a loss of $2.0 million for the
    call premium and write-off of unamortized fees related to the
    early redemption of the 5.875% senior notes due 2013.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $8.0 million in 2011, compared
    to $10.4 million in 2010. The largest component of other
    income in both years was interest income.

Goodwill

In performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, we determined that our
    goodwill balance of $15.9 million, all of which relates to
    our South Central reporting segment, was not impaired.

Expenses maintained at the
    corporate level consist primarily of interest and property
    taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or
    expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our
    corporate office. The amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the
    segment’s revenue, while interest expense and those
    expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to
    each segment based on the segment’s inventory balances.

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    11% in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to decreases in the
    number of homes closed in the majority of the region’s
    markets. The largest decrease in closings volume occurred in our
    New Jersey and Charlotte markets. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $13.5 million in 2011, compared to a
    loss of $6.3 million in 2010, primarily as a result of
    declines in revenue and gross profit. Inventory impairment
    charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs
    were $4.6 million and $8.6 million in fiscal 2011 and
    2010, respectively. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage
    of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage)
    decreased 200 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to
    fiscal 2010 due to the increased use of incentives to sell homes
    and weakening market conditions during the current year.
    Although total SG&A expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from
    the prior year, they increased as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues by 120 basis points in 2011.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 21% in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to
    decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the
    region’s markets. The region reported a loss before income
    taxes of $13.7 million in 2011, compared to a loss of
    $31.3 million in 2010. The improvement in the current year
    was primarily a result of fewer inventory impairment charges and
    earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs, which were
    $0.9 million in fiscal 2011, compared to $22.0 million
    in fiscal 2010. However, weak conditions persisted in the
    Chicago market which again contributed substantially to the
    region’s loss. Home sales gross profit percentage decreased
    190 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due
    to weakening market conditions compared to the prior year.
    Although total SG&A expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from
    the prior year, they increased as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues by 110 basis points in 2011.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 7% in 2011 compared to 2010, due to a decrease in the
    number of homes closed, partially offset by an increase in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $19.9 million in fiscal 2011
    compared to a loss of $7.5 million in fiscal 2010,
    primarily as a result of declines in revenue and gross profit.
    These results generally reflected softening across most markets
    from the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit, as well
    as more challenging conditions in the Orlando market. Inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs were $17.4 million and $17.5 million in
    fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Home sales gross profit
    percentage decreased 110 basis points in fiscal 2011
    compared to fiscal 2010 due to increased warranty costs in our
    Orlando and Pensacola markets. As a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues, total SG&A expenses increased 110 basis
    points in fiscal 2011.



South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 22% in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to
    decreases in the number of homes closed in all of the
    region’s markets, partially offset by an increase in the
    average selling prices of those homes. While we continued to be
    profitable in all markets in the region, overall the region
    reported a decline in income before income taxes to
    $52.4 million in fiscal 2011, from $83.4 million in
    fiscal 2010. The reduced income was the result of closing fewer
    homes with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit,
    leading to declines in revenue and gross profit. Inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs were $0.7 million and $14.0 million in
    fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Home sales gross profit
    percentage decreased 100 basis points in fiscal 2011
    compared to fiscal 2010 due to lower margins in the majority of
    the region’s markets, caused by an increase in construction
    and lot costs as a percentage of revenues. Although total
    SG&A expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year,
    they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    150 basis points in 2011. Our central Texas, Dallas and
    Houston markets continue to be the most profitable in the region.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 29% in 2011 compared to 2010, due to decreases in the
    number of homes closed in all of the region’s markets,
    partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of
    those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $3.8 million fiscal 2011, compared to income before income
    taxes of $12.0 million in fiscal 2010, primarily as a
    result of declines in revenue and gross profit in all of its
    markets, with Phoenix experiencing the worst conditions. Home
    sales gross profit percentage decreased 200 basis points in
    fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of
    the increased use of incentives to sell homes and weakening
    market conditions in all of the region’s markets. Also
    contributing to the decrease in gross profit percentage in the
    current year, inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs increased to $4.7 million,
    from $0.6 million in the prior year. Although total
    SG&A expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from the prior year,
    they increased as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    170 basis points in 2011.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    18% in 2011 compared to 2010, due to decreases in the number of
    homes closed in all of the region’s markets, partially
    offset by an increase in the average selling price of those
    homes. The Seattle market continued to generate the highest
    profits, while the inland, central California markets again did
    not achieve profitability. The region reported a loss before
    income taxes of $8.5 million in fiscal 2011, compared to
    income before income taxes of $27.8 million in fiscal 2010,
    primarily as a result of a decline in revenue and increased
    impairment charges. Inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs were
    $17.1 million in fiscal 2011, compared to $2.0 million
    in fiscal 2010. Home sales gross profit percentage decreased
    40 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
    Although total SG&A expenses in fiscal 2011 decreased from
    the prior year, they increased as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues by 150 basis points in 2011.

Excludes approximately 8,000 and
    7,300 lots at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively,
    representing lots controlled under lot option contracts for
    which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the
    land or lots, but the underlying contract has yet to be
    terminated. We have reserved the deposits related to these
    contracts.

At September 30, 2011, we owned or controlled approximately
    112,700 lots, compared to approximately 119,400 lots at
    September 30, 2010. Of the 112,700 total lots, we
    controlled approximately 26,900 lots (24%), with a total
    remaining purchase price of approximately $918.7 million,
    through land and lot option purchase contracts with a total of
    $14.6 million in earnest money deposits. At
    September 30, 2011, approximately 22,500 of our owned lots
    were finished.

We had a total of approximately 10,500 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,100 model homes at September 30,
    2011, compared to approximately 9,500 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,200 model homes at September 30,
    2010. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 5,600 and
    5,200 were unsold at September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. At September 30, 2011, approximately 2,800 of
    our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 600
    homes had been completed for more than six months. At
    September 30, 2010, approximately 3,200 of our unsold homes
    were completed, of which approximately 800 homes had been
    completed for more than six months.

Our current strategy is to take advantage of market
    opportunities by entering into new lot option contracts to
    purchase finished lots in selected communities to potentially
    increase sales volumes and profitability. We will attempt to
    renegotiate existing lot option contracts as necessary to reduce
    our lot costs and better match the scheduled lot purchases with
    new home demand in each community. We also manage our inventory
    of homes under construction by selectively starting construction
    on unsold homes to capture new home demand, while monitoring the
    number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our
    unsold, completed homes in inventory.

Cancellation rate represents the

Net
    Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders increased 15%, to
    $4,011.0 million (19,375 homes) in 2010 from
    $3,498.4 million (17,034 homes) in 2009. The number of net
    sales orders increased 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal
    2009. These results were impacted by increased levels of
    affordability resulting from lower home sales prices, declines
    in the number of new homes available for sale, a low mortgage
    interest rate environment, and the federal government’s
    monetary and fiscal policies and programs, including the federal
    homebuyer tax credit, which accelerated sales demand during the
    first half of the year. Although these results reflected
    improvement over the prior year, the significant decline in
    demand subsequent to the expiration of the federal tax credit
    indicated that market conditions remained weak.

In comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009, the value of net sales
    orders increased in most of our market regions, with the largest
    percentage increases occurring in our East, Southeast and South
    Central regions resulting from new communities in the Carolinas,
    Florida and Texas, as well as lower cancellation rates achieved
    in these regions. Conversely, our Midwest region experienced a
    13% decline in net sales orders, due to weak demand in our
    Chicago market. Fluctuations in the value of net sales orders
    were primarily due to the change in the number of homes sold in
    each respective region, and to a much lesser extent, small
    fluctuations



in the average selling price of those homes. The average price
    of our net sales orders in 2010 was $207,000, an increase of 1%
    from the $205,400 average in 2009.

Our annual sales order cancellation rate was 26% in fiscal 2010,
    compared to 30% in fiscal 2009. While an improvement from the
    prior year, this elevated cancellation rate was still above
    historical levels, reflecting the challenges in most of our
    homebuilding markets.

Our homes in backlog at September 30, 2010 declined 27%
    from the prior year as a result of closing homes at a greater
    rate than our sales pace during the latter half of the year and
    the effects of the federal homebuyer tax credit that was in
    effect at September 30, 2009.

Home
    Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales increased 21%, to $4,302.3 million
    (20,875 homes closed) in 2010 from $3,563.6 million (16,703
    homes closed) in 2009. The average selling price of homes closed
    during 2010 was $206,100, down 3% from the $213,400 average in
    2009. During fiscal 2010, home sales revenues increased in most
    of our market regions, with significant increases in our East,
    Southeast and South Central markets. These increases resulted
    from increases in the number of homes closed.

The number of homes closed in 2010 increased 25% due to
    increases in five of our six market regions. The increase in
    home closings reflects the impact of the first-time
    homebuyer’s federal tax credit, which initially required
    buyers to close on their home purchase transaction by
    June 30, 2010. We believe this helped stimulate demand for
    homes that could close during the first nine months of fiscal
    2010. We also believe that our operating strategy of selectively
    starting construction on unsold homes, which made additional
    housing inventory available to close by June 30, 2010, led
    to increased home closings volume by better capturing this



demand. The Southwest region had an 8% decrease in homes closed
    due to both weak demand in the Phoenix market and our prior year
    efforts to reduce completed home inventories in that market.

Home
    Sales Gross Profit

Gross profit from home sales increased by 59%, to
    $744.0 million in 2010, from $467.5 million in 2009,
    and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, increased
    420 basis points, to 17.3%. Approximately 350 basis
    points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage
    was a result of the average cost of our homes declining by more
    than our average selling prices, caused largely by a reduction
    in our construction costs on homes closed during fiscal 2010.
    The reduction in construction costs primarily resulted from
    changes in product design, as well as cost reductions obtained
    from our suppliers and

sub-contractors

in prior periods. In addition, the increase in home sales gross
    profit was partially due to our efforts beginning in fiscal 2009
    to acquire lot positions in new communities and construct and
    close houses from these new projects. Homes closed on these
    acquired finished lots yielded higher gross profits than those
    on land and lots acquired in prior years. Approximately
    70 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in
    the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a
    percentage of homes sales revenues, resulting from reductions in
    our interest and property taxes incurred over the year, as well
    as more closings occurring on acquired finished lots, rather
    than internally developed lots.

Land
    Sales Revenue

Land sales revenues decreased 82% to $7.4 million in 2010,
    from $40.3 million in 2009. Of the $40.3 million of
    revenues in fiscal 2009, $26.9 million related to land sale
    transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for which
    recognition of the revenue had been deferred due to the terms of
    the sale.

Inventory
    Impairments and Land Option Cost Write-offs

During fiscal 2010, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and outlook for
    all of our communities, the assumptions utilized reflected our
    expectation of continued challenging conditions and
    uncertainties in the homebuilding industry and in our markets.
    As of September 30, 2010, we evaluated communities with a
    combined carrying value of $409.8 million for impairment.
    In performing this analysis, we utilized a range of discount
    rates for communities of 14% to 20%. Through this evaluation
    process, we determined that communities with a carrying value of
    $63.1 million as of September 30, 2010, were impaired.
    As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
    recorded impairment charges of $29.1 million to reduce the
    carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated
    fair value, as compared to $174.9 million in the same
    period of the prior year. The fourth quarter charges combined
    with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in
    total inventory impairment



charges of $62.3 million and $377.8 million during
    fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2010,
    approximately 93% of the impairment charges were recorded to
    residential land and lots and land held for development, and
    approximately 7% of the charges were recorded to construction in
    progress and finished homes inventory, compared to 85% and 15%,
    respectively, in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we wrote off $2.4 million and
    $29.9 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts. The
    inventory impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding
    gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    approximately 150 basis points in fiscal 2010, compared to
    1,130 basis points in fiscal 2009.

A community may consist of land
    held for development, residential land and lots developed and
    under development, and construction in progress and finished
    homes. A particular community often includes inventory in more
    than one category. Further, a community may contain multiple
    parcels with varying product types (e.g. entry level and

move-up

single family detached, as well as attached product types). Some
    communities have no homes under construction, finished homes, or
    current home sales efforts or activity.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased
    slightly to $523.2 million in 2010 from $523.0 million
    in 2009. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A
    expense decreased 240 basis points, to 12.1% in 2010 from
    14.5% in 2009. The largest component of our homebuilding
    SG&A expense is employee compensation and related costs,
    which represented 58% and 55% of SG&A costs in 2010 and
    2009, respectively. These costs increased by 6%, to
    $304.0 million in 2010 from $287.2 million in 2009.
    Our homebuilding operations employed approximately 2,500 and
    2,300 employees at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Interest
    Incurred

Comparing fiscal 2010 with fiscal 2009, interest incurred
    related to homebuilding debt decreased 16% to
    $173.2 million, primarily due to a 19% decrease in our
    average homebuilding debt. We expensed $86.3 million of
    homebuilding interest during fiscal 2010, compared to
    $100.2 million of interest during fiscal 2009. Interest
    amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written off with
    inventory impairment charges, was 3.4% of total home and
    land/lot cost of sales in 2010, compared to 3.9% in 2009.

Loss/Gain
    on Early Retirement of Debt

We retired $822.2 million principal amount of our senior
    and senior subordinated notes prior to their maturity during
    fiscal 2010, compared to $380.3 million in fiscal 2009.
    Related to the early retirement of these notes, we recognized a
    net loss of $4.9 million in fiscal 2010 and a net gain of
    $11.5 million in fiscal 2009. The loss in fiscal 2010
    includes a loss of $2.0 million for the call premium and
    write-off of unamortized fees related to the early redemption of
    our 5.875% senior notes due 2013. The gain in fiscal 2009
    was partially offset by a $7.6 million loss related to the
    early termination of our revolving credit facility in May 2009.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $10.4 million in 2010, compared
    to $12.8 million in 2009. The largest component of other
    income in both years was interest income.



Goodwill

In performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, we determined that our
    goodwill balance of $15.9 million, all of which relates to
    our South Central reporting segment, was not impaired.

Expenses maintained at the
    corporate level consist primarily of interest and property
    taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or
    expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our
    corporate office. The amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the
    segment’s revenue, while interest expense and those
    expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to
    each segment based on the segment’s inventory balances.

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues increased
    42% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an increase in
    the number of homes closed, with the largest increases occurring
    in our New Jersey and Carolina markets. The region reported a
    loss before income taxes of $6.3 million in 2010, compared
    to a loss of $95.9 million in 2009. The results were due in
    part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $8.6 million and
    $64.9 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    region’s gross profit from home sales as a percentage of
    home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage)
    increased 390 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009. The increase was a result of a reduction in the
    construction costs of our homes closed during fiscal 2010. Also,
    a reduction in the region’s SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 420 basis
    points to the region’s improvement in loss before income
    taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, as the
    region’s additional closing volume helped leverage these
    SG&A expenses.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 5% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to
    increases in the number of homes closed in all of the
    region’s markets. The region reported a loss before income
    taxes of $31.3 million in 2010, compared to a loss of
    $104.9 million in 2009. The results were due in part to
    inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $22.0 million and
    $54.7 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Substantially all of our fiscal 2010 impairments for this region
    related to projects in our Chicago market. The region’s
    home sales gross profit percentage increased 920 basis
    points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was
    a result of higher margins primarily in our Chicago and Denver
    markets. The Denver market also benefitted from lower warranty
    costs on previously closed homes. In fiscal 2010, a reduction in
    the region’s SG&A expenses as a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues contributed 280 basis points to the
    region’s improvement in loss before income taxes as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 31% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, with the largest
    increases occurring in our central Florida and Atlanta markets.
    The region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $7.5 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a



loss of $73.2 million in fiscal 2009. The results were due
    in part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $17.5 million and
    $38.0 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    460 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets, led by our south and
    central Florida markets. The increase in homes sales gross
    profit percentage was a result of construction costs declining
    at a faster rate than the decline in average selling price on
    homes closed during fiscal 2010. Also contributing to the
    increase in home sales gross profit are our efforts since the
    beginning of fiscal 2009 to acquire lot positions in new
    communities and construct and close houses from these new
    projects. Homes closed on these acquired finished lots were
    generally yielding higher gross profits than those on land and
    lots acquired in prior years. In fiscal 2010, a reduction in the
    region’s SG&A expenses as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues contributed 250 basis points to the region’s
    improvement in income before income taxes as a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues as the region’s additional closing
    volume helped leverage these SG&A expenses.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 35% in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, with the largest
    increases occurring in our Central Texas, Houston and
    Dallas/Fort Worth markets. The region reported income
    before income taxes of $83.4 million in fiscal 2010,
    compared to income of $4.9 million in fiscal 2009. The
    improvement was due in large part to the increase in revenue,
    combined with the region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage increasing 290 basis points in fiscal 2010
    compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets. These higher margins
    were primarily attributable to reductions in construction costs
    of our homes. Additionally, a decrease in inventory impairment
    charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs,
    which were $14.0 million in fiscal 2010 compared to
    $20.0 million in fiscal 2009, contributed to the
    region’s increase in income before income taxes.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 14% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a decrease in the
    number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those
    homes. The decreases in revenues and homes closed were due to
    continuing weakness in the Phoenix market. The region reported
    income before income taxes of $12.0 million in 2010,
    compared to a loss before income taxes of $45.8 million in
    2009. The loss in 2009 was due in large part to inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs totaling $39.4 million. The region’s home
    sales gross profit percentage increased 330 basis points in
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was a result
    of the average cost of the region’s homes declining by more
    than the average selling prices, driven in large part by
    reductions in home construction costs. In addition, the increase
    in home sales gross profit is partially due to our recent
    efforts to acquire lot positions in new communities and
    construct and close houses from these projects. In fiscal 2010,
    a reduction in the region’s SG&A expenses, both in
    absolute terms and as a percentage of homebuilding revenues,
    also contributed to the improvement in income before income
    taxes.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues increased
    6% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to an increase in the number of
    homes closed, which was partially offset by a decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The largest increases in
    homes closed occurred in our Seattle and Southern California
    markets. The region reported income before income taxes of
    $27.8 million in 2010, compared to a loss before income
    taxes of $226.4 million in 2009. The loss in 2009 was due
    in large part to inventory impairment charges and earnest money
    and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $190.7 million, compared to $2.0 million in 2010. The
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage increased
    400 basis points in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase was a result of higher margins on homes closed in
    the majority of the region’s markets, driven in large part
    by reductions in home construction costs. In fiscal 2010, a
    reduction in the region’s SG&A expenses as a
    percentage of homebuilding revenues contributed 260 basis
    points to the region’s improvement in income before income
    taxes as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, as a result of
    absolute reductions in SG&A expenses, as well as the
    additional revenue providing more leverage against these costs.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage
    operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by
    our homebuilding operations. Total first-lien loans originated
    or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 19%
    in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, corresponding to the 20%
    decrease in the number of homes closed. Our mortgage capture
    rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding
    operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers’
    financing) was 61% in both years.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 85%
    of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2011, compared to 90% in
    2010, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The relatively lower captive percentage in the
    current year reflects a higher level of refinancing and new
    mortgage loan originations from non-homebuilding sources than in
    the prior year.

The number of loans sold to third-party purchasers decreased by
    15% in 2011 compared to 2010, consistent with the decrease in
    the number of loans originated of 14% between the years.
    Virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal
    2011 and mortgage loans held for sale on September 30, 2011
    were eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage
    Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    (Freddie Mac) or Government National Mortgage Association
    (Ginnie Mae). Approximately 89% of the mortgage loans sold by
    DHI Mortgage during fiscal 2011 were sold to two major financial
    institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements. Late in
    fiscal 2011, one of these financial institutions announced their
    intention to exit their correspondent lending business and will
    no longer purchase loans from us beyond December 2011. We have
    been negotiating with other institutions to establish new loan
    purchase agreements. With the combination of selling to
    potential new purchasers and increasing sales volumes to our
    existing purchasers, we expect to be able to continue to
    originate and sell mortgage loans at our current volumes. If we
    are unable to sell our mortgages to these or other purchasers,
    our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans could be
    significantly reduced and the profitability of our financial
    services operations would be negatively impacted.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 4%
    overall, to $87.2 million in 2011 from $90.5 million
    in 2010. Revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains
    from sale of mortgages decreased 11% as a result of a 15%
    decrease in the volume of loans sold. Loan origination fees
    increased 3%, despite a 14% decrease in loans originated, due to
    small changes in pricing structure implemented during the
    current year.

Charges related to recourse obligations decreased 15%, to
    $11.6 million in fiscal 2011 from $13.7 million in
    fiscal 2010. The calculation of our required repurchase loss
    reserve is based upon an analysis of repurchase requests
    received, our actual repurchases and losses through the
    disposition of such loans or requests, discussions with our
    mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated.
    While we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on
    known and projected repurchase requests, if either actual
    repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases
    exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be
    incurred. Additionally, a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion
    of the private mortgage insurance written on loans originated by
    DHI Mortgage in prior years. Charges to increase reserves for
    expected losses on the reinsured loans were $1.8 million
    and $1.9 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Financial services general and administrative (G&A) expense
    was $76.3 million in 2011, decreasing slightly from
    $77.2 million in 2010. As a percentage of financial
    services revenues (excluding the effects of recourse and
    reinsurance expense), G&A expense increased to 75.8% in
    2011, from 72.8% in 2010. The increase was due to the reduction
    in revenues resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume
    compared to the prior year. Fluctuations in financial services
    G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to
    occur as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan
    volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

Total first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage
    for our homebuyers increased by 14% in fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009, corresponding to the 25% increase in the number of
    homes closed. The percentage increase in loans originated was
    lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed
    by our homebuilding operations due to a decrease in our mortgage
    capture rate to 61% in 2010, from 67% in 2009.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 90%
    of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2010, compared to 83% in
    2009, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The relatively higher captive percentage in 2010
    reflects a lower level of refinancing activity than in 2009.

The number of loans sold to third-party purchasers was virtually
    the same in 2010 as compared to 2009, while the number of loans
    originated increased by 5%. Virtually all of the mortgage loans
    originated during fiscal 2010 and mortgage loans held for sale
    on September 30, 2010 were Agency-eligible. Approximately
    86% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage during fiscal
    2010 were sold to two major financial institutions pursuant to
    their loan purchase agreements.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment increased 69%, to
    $90.5 million in 2010 from $53.7 million in 2009. Loan
    origination fees decreased 5%, to $17.7 million in 2010
    from $18.6 million in 2009, while the number of loans
    originated increased 5% during the same period. Loan origination
    fees recorded in fiscal 2009 benefitted from the adoption of the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) authoritative
    guidance for fair value measurements of certain financial
    instruments, which resulted in the recognition of
    $2.4 million of loan origination fees and $5.0 million
    of general and administrative (G&A) costs related to prior
    period loan originations. Revenues from the sale of servicing
    rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 5%, to
    $59.6 million in 2010, from $56.8 million in 2009.
    Charges related to recourse obligations were $13.7 million
    in fiscal 2010, compared to $33.2 million in fiscal 2009.
    Also, a subsidiary of ours reinsured a portion of private
    mortgage insurance written on loans originated by DHI Mortgage
    in prior years. Charges to increase reserves for expected losses
    on the reinsured loans were $1.9 million and
    $14.9 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Financial services G&A expense decreased 1%, to
    $77.2 million in 2010 from $78.1 million in 2009, but
    increased 6% when excluding $5.0 million of compensation
    costs recognized in fiscal 2009 upon the adoption of the
    FASB’s authoritative guidance for fair value measurements
    as discussed above. The largest component of our financial
    services G&A expense is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 78% and 75% of G&A costs in 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Excluding the $5.0 million
    adjustment discussed above, these costs increased 14%, to
    $60.5 million in 2010 from $53.3 million in 2009. The
    increase in the current year relates to an increase in the
    number of financial services employees to approximately 700 at
    September 30, 2010, from 600 at September 30, 2009 to
    support our increased volume and more stringent mortgage
    purchaser underwriting guidelines.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, excluding the
    effects of recourse and reinsurance expense, G&A expense
    decreased to 72.8% in 2010, from 76.7% in 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to the adoption in 2009 of the FASB’s
    authoritative guidance for fair value measurements of certain
    financial instruments as discussed above, partially offset by
    additional costs incurred to support more stringent mortgage
    purchaser underwriting guidelines.



Results
    of Operations — Consolidated

Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended
    September 30, 2010

Income
    before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for fiscal 2011 was
    $12.1 million, compared to $99.5 million for fiscal
    2010. The difference in our operating results for 2011 compared
    to a year ago is primarily due to a lower volume of homes closed
    which resulted in lower revenues.

Income
    Taxes

In fiscal 2011, our income tax benefit was $59.7 million,
    compared to a benefit of $145.6 million in 2010. The income
    tax benefit in fiscal 2011 was due to the reduction of our
    accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest
    by $61.4 million, partially offset by an accrual for state
    income taxes of $1.7 million. In fiscal 2010, a tax law
    change regarding net operating loss (NOL) carrybacks resulted in
    an income tax benefit of $208.3 million, which was
    partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and
    state income tax expense. We do not have meaningful effective
    tax rates in these years because our net deferred tax assets are
    offset fully by a valuation allowance.

We had income taxes receivable of $12.4 million and
    $16.0 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. The income taxes receivable at September 30,
    2011 relates to federal tax refunds we expect to receive.

At September 30, 2011, we had federal NOL carryforwards of
    $436.2 million that expire in fiscal 2030 and 2031. Also at
    September 30, 2011, we had tax benefits for state NOL
    carryforwards of $88.7 million that expire (beginning at
    various times depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal
    2013 to fiscal 2031. At September 30, 2011, we had federal
    tax credit carryforwards of $3.2 million that expire in
    fiscal years 2029 through 2031.

At September 30, 2011 and 2010, we had net deferred tax
    assets of $848.5 million and $902.6 million,
    respectively, offset by valuation allowances of
    $848.5 million and $902.6 million, respectively. The
    realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends upon
    the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We
    continue to analyze the positive and negative evidence in
    determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to
    our deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis. A significant
    part of the negative evidence we consider comes from our
    continued three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position, which was
    $445 million at the end of fiscal 2011. Currently, this
    loss is largely the result of pre-tax losses incurred in fiscal
    2009. The valuation allowance could be reduced in future periods
    when we are no longer in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss
    position and if there is sufficient evidence to support a
    conclusion that it is not needed for some portion or all of our
    deferred tax assets. Realization of a significant portion of our
    deferred tax assets for state NOL carryforwards is more unlikely
    than the remaining deferred tax assets due to the need to
    generate a substantially higher level of taxable income prior to
    the expirations of the various state carryforward periods which
    expire sooner than our federal NOL carryforwards. The accounting
    for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results.
    Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these
    future results could have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations or financial position.

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the
    benefits recognized for accounting purposes. At
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, all tax positions, if
    recognized, would affect our annual effective tax rate. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $16.3 million
    and $65.0 million as of September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted
    from us receiving a favorable result from the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) on a ruling request concerning the capitalization
    of inventory costs and a reduction in our accrual for state
    income tax issues.



We classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as
    income tax expense. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recognized
    interest expense (benefit) related to unrecognized tax benefits
    of ($12.7) million and $11.6 million, respectively, in
    our consolidated statements of operations. At September 30,
    2011 and 2010, our total accrued interest expense relating to
    unrecognized tax benefits was $5.1 million and
    $17.8 million, respectively, and there were no accrued
    penalties. As a result of our full valuation allowance on our
    net deferred tax assets, all accrued interest expense would
    affect our annual effective tax rate if the associated tax
    positions were recognized.

A reduction of $2.5 million in the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits and accrued interest with respect to state issues
    is reasonably possible within the next 12 months and would
    result in an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of
    operations.

We are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in
    multiple states. The statute of limitations for our major tax
    jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004
    through 2011. We are currently being audited by the IRS for
    fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and by various states. Our federal
    NOL refunds from fiscal 2008 and 2009 are subject to
    Congressional Joint Committee review.

Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended
    September 30, 2009

Income
    (Loss) before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 was
    $99.5 million, compared to a loss before income taxes of
    $556.8 million for fiscal 2009. The difference in our
    operating results for 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to
    increased revenue from the higher volume of homes closed, a
    higher gross profit from home sales revenues and lower inventory
    impairment charges.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax benefit in fiscal 2010 was $145.6 million,
    compared to a benefit of $7.0 million in 2009. A tax law
    change enacted during fiscal 2010 allowed us to carry back our
    fiscal 2009 NOL five years. This resulted in a benefit from
    income taxes of $208.3 million during fiscal 2010, which
    was partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits
    and state income tax expense. We do not have meaningful
    effective tax rates in these years because of the valuation
    allowances on our deferred tax assets.

We had income taxes receivable of $16.0 million and
    $293.1 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, related to federal and state NOL carrybacks and
    amended returns. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, we had net
    deferred income tax assets of $902.6 million and
    $1,073.9 million, respectively, offset by valuation
    allowances of $902.6 million and $1,073.9 million,
    respectively.

Overview
    of Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial
    services operations with cash flows from operating activities,
    borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new
    debt securities. During the past few years, we have generated
    cash flows through reductions in assets, as well as through
    profitable operations. Our cash generation has also benefitted
    from income tax refunds. The generation of cash flow has allowed
    us to increase our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet,
    providing us with the operational flexibility to invest in
    market opportunities as they arise and adjust to future
    homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these
    conditions. We intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance
    sheet strength, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities
    to access the capital markets as they become available.

At September 30, 2011, our ratio of net homebuilding debt
    to total capital was 18.0%, an increase of 190 basis points
    from 16.1% at September 30, 2010. Net homebuilding debt to
    total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash
    and marketable securities divided by total capital net of cash
    and marketable securities (homebuilding notes payable net of
    cash and marketable securities plus total equity). The increase
    in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at
    September 30, 2011 as compared to the ratio a year earlier
    was due to a decrease in cash, the effect of which was largely
    offset by a reduction in our debt balance. While the challenging
    conditions persist in the homebuilding industry, we intend to
    maintain a ratio



of net homebuilding debt to total capital below our historic
    target operating range of 45%. However, future period-end net
    homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the
    18.0% ratio achieved at September 30, 2011.

We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our
    homebuilding operations and comparing us with other
    homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services
    business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation
    under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized
    and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our
    homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we
    include our homebuilding cash and marketable securities as a
    reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. For
    comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital
    above, at September 30, 2011 and 2010, our ratios of
    homebuilding debt to total capital, without netting cash and
    marketable securities balances, were 37.7% and 44.3%,
    respectively.

We believe that we will be able to fund our near-term working
    capital needs and debt obligations from existing cash resources
    and our mortgage repurchase facility. For our longer-term
    capital requirements, we will evaluate the need to issue new
    debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or
    obtain additional bank financing as market conditions may permit.

Homebuilding
    Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2011, we had available homebuilding cash and
    cash equivalents of $715.5 million.

Marketable Securities

— At September 30,
    2011, we had marketable securities of $297.6 million. Our
    marketable securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities,
    government agency securities, corporate debt securities and
    certificates of deposit.

Secured Letter of Credit Agreements

— We have
    secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit
    cash, in an amount approximating the balance of letters of
    credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing banks. At
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, the amount of cash restricted
    for this purpose totaled $47.5 million and
    $52.6 million, respectively, and is included in
    homebuilding restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.

Public Unsecured Debt

— The indentures
    governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation
    of secured debt and liens. At September 30, 2011, we were
    in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that
    form a part of the public debt obligations.

Shelf Registration Statement

— We have an
    automatically effective universal shelf registration statement
    filed with the SEC in September 2009, registering debt and
    equity securities which we may issue from time to time in
    amounts to be determined.

Financial
    Services Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2011, the amount of financial services cash
    and cash equivalents was $17.1 million.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility

— Our mortgage
    subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility
    that is accounted for as a secured financing. The mortgage
    repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI
    Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI
    Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against
    the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming
    purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
    to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party
    purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time
    frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of
    the mortgage repurchase facility. The total capacity of the
    facility was $150 million for the period from June 29,
    2011 through October 20, 2011, after which time it was
    reduced to $100 million. The maturity date of the facility
    is March 4, 2012.

As of September 30, 2011, $251.5 million of mortgage
    loans held for sale were pledged under the mortgage repurchase
    facility. These mortgage loans had a collateral value of
    $236.3 million. DHI Mortgage



has the option to fund a portion of its repurchase obligations
    in advance. As a result of advance paydowns totaling
    $119.8 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of
    $116.5 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase
    facility at September 30, 2011 at a 3.8% annual interest
    rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our
    homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as
    to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net
    worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth
    and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured
    and reported monthly. At September 30, 2011, DHI Mortgage
    was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of
    the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or
    extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior
    to its maturity, and obtain temporary additional commitments
    through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of
    higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The
    liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its
    continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase
    facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient
    capacities.

Operating
    Cash Flow Activities

During fiscal 2011, net cash provided by our operating
    activities was $14.9 million, compared to
    $709.4 million during fiscal 2010. During the prior year, a
    significant portion of the net cash provided by our operating
    activities was due to federal income tax refunds and the profit
    we generated during the year. The net cash provided by our
    operating activities during the past few years has resulted in
    substantial liquidity. This liquidity gives us the flexibility
    to determine the appropriate operating strategy for each of our
    communities and to take advantage of opportunities in the
    market. We have limited our purchases of undeveloped land and
    our development spending on land we own to generally smaller
    projects or phases which yield finished lot quantities in line
    with expected near-term home production. Additionally, we are
    purchasing or contracting to purchase finished lots in many
    markets to potentially increase sales and home closing volumes
    and return to sustainable profitability. Depending upon future
    homebuilding market conditions and our expectations for these
    conditions, we may use a portion of our cash balances to
    increase our inventories.

Investing
    Cash Flow Activities

During fiscal 2011, net cash used in our investing activities
    was $19.3 million, compared to $318.0 million in 2010.
    During the current year, $300.1 million was used to
    purchase marketable securities, and proceeds from the sale or
    maturity of securities during the year totaled
    $292.5 million. In the prior year, $328.0 million was
    used to purchase marketable securities, and proceeds from the
    sale of securities totaled $27.7 million. Additionally, in
    fiscal 2011 and 2010 we used $16.3 million and
    $19.2 million, respectively, to invest in purchases of
    property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and
    office equipment. These purchases are generally not significant
    relative to our total assets or cash flows. Also affecting our
    investing cash flows are changes in restricted cash, which
    decreased $4.6 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2011
    and 2010, respectively. Changes in restricted cash are primarily
    due to fluctuations in the balance of our outstanding letters of
    credit.

Financing
    Cash Flow Activities

During the last three years, most of our short-term financing
    needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and
    borrowings available under our financial services credit
    facility. Long-term financing needs of our homebuilding
    operations have historically been funded with the issuance of
    senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital
    markets. During fiscal 2011, we repaid, through maturities,
    redemptions and repurchases, a total of $495.4 million
    principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an
    aggregate purchase price of $505.3 million, plus accrued
    interest. During fiscal 2010, we repaid, through maturities,
    redemptions and repurchases, a total of $1,016.3 million
    principal amount of various issues of senior notes for an
    aggregate purchase price of $1,018.2 million, plus accrued
    interest. During fiscal 2011, we also used cash for the
    repurchase of our common stock as discussed below.



Consistent with dividends paid in fiscal 2009 and 2010, our
    Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends of
    $0.0375 per common share during fiscal 2011. The last of these
    was paid on August 24, 2011 to stockholders of record on
    August 12, 2011. On November 10, 2011, our Board of
    Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.0375 per common share,
    payable on December 13, 2011, to stockholders of record on
    December 2, 2011. The declaration of future cash dividends
    is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
    upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital
    requirements, our financial condition and general business
    conditions.

Changes
    in Capital Structure

On August 1, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and
    $100 million of our common stock effective through
    July 31, 2012. At September 30, 2011,
    $422.9 million of the debt authorization was remaining and
    all of the common stock authorization was remaining.

In October 2011, through unsolicited transactions, we
    repurchased $10.8 million principal amount of our
    6.5% senior notes due 2016, which further reduced the debt
    repurchase authorization.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased
    3,544,838 shares of our common stock at a total cost of
    $38.6 million.

In recent years, our primary non-operating use of available
    capital has been to repay debt, and in fiscal 2011 we also made
    limited stock repurchases at prices we believe to be attractive.
    We continue to evaluate our alternatives for future
    non-operating sources and uses of our available capital,
    including debt repayments, dividend payments or common stock
    repurchases, while considering the overall level of our cash
    balances within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage
    targets and our liquidity targets.

Contractual
    Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding
    and financial services segments are payments under our debt
    agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase
    obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific
    performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements
    that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land
    seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our
    contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business
    through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows
    generated from operations, renewed or amended mortgage
    repurchase facilities and, if needed or believed advantageous,
    the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public
    capital markets as market conditions may permit.



Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of
    September 30, 2011 are presented below:

Homebuilding notes payable
    represent principal and interest payments due on our senior,
    convertible senior and secured notes.

(2)

Financial services notes payable
    represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage
    subsidiary’s repurchase facility. The interest obligation
    associated with this variable rate facility is based on its
    annual effective rate of 3.8% and principal balance outstanding
    at September 30, 2011.

At September 30, 2011, our homebuilding operations had
    outstanding letters of credit of $46.9 million, all of
    which were cash collateralized, and surety bonds of
    $689.2 million, issued by third parties, to secure
    performance under various contracts. We expect that our
    performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and
    bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of
    business and in accordance with the applicable contractual
    terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related
    letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly
    thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have
    no material third-party guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related
    to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk” under Part II of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

We enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts
    enable us to control significant lot positions with limited
    capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated
    with land ownership and development. Within the land and lot
    option purchase contracts at September 30, 2011, there were
    a limited number of contracts, representing $8.2 million of
    remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance
    clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon
    the land sellers meeting their obligations. Further discussion
    of our land option contracts is provided in the “Land and
    Lot Position and Homes in Inventory” section included
    herein.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Prior to
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, we generally
    had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had
    greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased
    our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations
    during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our
    funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our
    financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a
    result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations
    and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter
    are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal
    year.



Although the weakness in homebuilding market conditions
    mitigated our historical seasonal variations in recent years,
    our home closings and income before income taxes were higher in
    the second half of fiscal 2011 than in the first half of the
    year. However, given the current uncertain outlook for market
    conditions we can make no assurances as to whether this pattern
    will continue beyond the current fiscal year.

Inflation

We may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation,
    primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material
    construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates
    significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage
    financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through
    to our customers any increases in our costs through increased
    sales prices. However, during periods of soft housing market
    conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases with
    higher selling prices.

    Statements

Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in
    other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC,
    statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral
    statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in
    the course of presentations about us, may be construed as
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E
    of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking

Critical
    Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the
    significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying
    financial statements as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and
    for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Each
    of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current
    authoritative literature that collectively comprises
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In
    instances where alternative methods of accounting are
    permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most
    appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results
    of our operations and our financial condition, and have
    consistently applied those methods over each of the periods
    presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting
    policies selected.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize
    homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the
    closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property
    are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the
    buyer’s financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our
    wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an
    adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit is
    deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a
    third-party purchaser has been completed. Any profit on land
    sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are
    met. We include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit
    at title companies in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales
    contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance
    payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options
    related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as
    liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are
    canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits
    on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable
    provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our
    title operations as closing services are rendered and title
    insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur
    simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially
    all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies
    to third-party insurers. We typically elect the fair value
    option for our mortgage loan originations. Mortgage loans held
    for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either
    sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for
    subsequent changes in fair value until the loan is sold. Net
    origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are
    recognized at the time of origination. The expected net future
    cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are
    included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that
    are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of
    commitment. We generally do not retain or service originated
    mortgages; rather, we seek to sell the mortgages and related
    servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is
    earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the
    loan is sold.

Some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions.
    Based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage
    purchasers, analysis of the mortgages we originated and current
    housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a
    loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage
    loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage
    loan repurchase requests. A 20% or 40% increase in the amount of
    expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on
    mortgage loan repurchases would result in an increase of
    approximately $3.8 million or $8.2 million,
    respectively, in our reserve for expected mortgage loan
    repurchases.

Marketable Securities

— We invest a portion of
    our cash on hand by purchasing marketable securities with
    maturities in excess of three months. We consider our investment
    portfolio to be

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value. At
    the end of a reporting period, unrealized gains and losses on
    these investments, net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) on



the consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses realized upon
    the sale of marketable securities are determined by specific
    identification and are included in homebuilding other income.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory
    includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development
    and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes
    and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home
    construction. Costs that we incur after development projects or
    homes are substantially complete, such as utilities,
    maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as
    incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of
    sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs
    of advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. We use the specific
    identification method for the purpose of accumulating home
    construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the
    specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are allocated on a pro-rata basis
    to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant
    development activity, which generally relates to the remaining
    homes in the community.

When a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred
    costs necessary to complete the home. We record as a liability
    and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will
    ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been
    closed. We compare our home construction budgets to actual
    recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be
    paid on each closed home. We monitor the accrual by comparing
    actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to
    the amount previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid
    in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our
    current accruals, differences in amounts historically have not
    been significant.

Each quarter, we review our inventory to determine whether
    recorded costs and any estimated costs required to complete each
    home or community are recoverable. If the review indicates that
    an impairment loss is required, an estimate of the loss is made
    and recorded to cost of sales in that quarter.

Land inventory and related communities under development are
    reviewed for potential write-downs when impairment indicators
    are present. We generally review our inventory at the community
    level and the inventory within each community is categorized as
    land held for development, residential land and lots developed
    and under development,

and/or

construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development. A particular
    community often includes inventory in more than one category. In
    certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for
    impairment purposes based on its product type (e.g. single
    family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels). In
    reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment
    indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a
    variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we
    perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows
    estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their
    carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are required to
    be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their
    carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are
    significantly impacted by community specific factors including



estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and
    estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor
    costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local
    market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of our communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;

•

alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of
    land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;

•

amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market
    or

sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our
    determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting
    the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the
    inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
    cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is
    determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the
    community in the same manner as land and development costs are
    allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is
    categorized as construction in progress and finished homes,
    residential land and lots developed and under development, and
    land held for development, based on the stage of production or
    plans for future development.

We typically do not purchase land for resale. However, when we
    own land or communities under development that no longer fit
    into our development and construction plans and we determine
    that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset, the
    project is accounted for as land held for sale, assuming the
    land held for sale criteria are met. We record land held for
    sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less
    estimated costs to sell. In performing the impairment evaluation
    for land held for sale, we consider several factors including,
    but not limited to, prices for land in recent comparable sales
    transactions, market analysis studies, which include the
    estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and
    recent legitimate offers received. If the estimated fair value
    less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying
    value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
    less costs to sell.

Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in
    substantially completed communities when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair
    values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to asset valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. Our quarterly assessments reflect management’s
    estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of

held-for-sale

assets through the disposition date.

Land and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

— We
    enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these
    contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for
    the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a
    future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms
    of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits
    are not refundable at our discretion.

Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs we incur related to
    land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of
    the following conditions have been met: (1) the costs are
    directly identifiable with the specific property; (2) the
    costs would be capitalized if the property were already
    acquired; and (3) acquisition of the property is probable,
    meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire
    the property, and there is no indication that the property is
    not available for sale. We consider the following when
    determining if the acquisition of the property is probable:
    (1) changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting
    for the purchase of the land; (2) current contract terms,
    including per lot price and required purchase dates; and



(3) our current land position in the given market or

sub-market.

Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are
    expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we
    will no longer acquire the property under option and will not be
    able to recover these costs through other means.

Certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation
    of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel
    under option. We determine if we are the primary beneficiary of
    the variable interest entity based on our ability to control
    both (1) the activities of a variable interest entity that
    most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance
    and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or
    the right to receive benefits from the entity. Based on this
    evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with
    which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase
    contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated.
    Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no
    recourse against us.

Fair Value Measurements

— The FASB’s
    authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a
    three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation
    model of an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy and its
    application to our assets and liabilities, is as follows:

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and based on our own estimates about the
    assumptions that market participants would use to value the
    asset or liability.

When available, we use quoted market prices in active markets to
    determine fair value. We consider the principal market and
    nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when
    determining the fair value measurements, if applicable. Fair
    value measurements are used for our marketable securities,
    mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments
    (IRLCs) and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis,
    and are used for inventories, other mortgage loans and real
    estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable.

Goodwill

— In September 2011, we early adopted
    the FASB’s authoritative guidance which allows an entity to
    assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one
    of the two-step annual goodwill impairment test. If an entity
    believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is
    more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
    exceeds its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment
    test is not required. We performed a qualitative assessment of
    goodwill at September 30, 2011, and determined that the
    two-step process was not necessary.

Warranty Claims

— We typically provide our
    homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in
    structural elements such as framing components and foundation
    systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical
    systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction
    components. Since we subcontract our construction work to
    subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a
    certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their
    work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally
    the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty
    liabilities are established by charging cost of sales for each
    home delivered. The amounts charged are based on
    management’s estimate of expected warranty-related costs
    under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. Our warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which we operate, and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual
    future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
    amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to
    estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material
    change in our accrual.

Insurance and Legal Claims

— We record expenses
    and liabilities related to the costs for exposures related to
    construction defects and claims and lawsuits incurred in the
    ordinary course of business, including employment matters,
    personal injury claims, land development issues and contract
    disputes. Also, we record



expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of potential
    construction defect claims and lawsuits (including expected
    legal costs), based on an analysis of our historical claims,
    which includes an estimate of construction defect claims
    incurred but not yet reported. Related to the exposures for
    actual construction defect claims and estimates of construction
    defect claims incurred but not yet reported and other legal
    claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business,
    we estimate and record insurance receivables for these matters
    under applicable insurance policies when recovery is probable.
    Additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of
    our legal expenses from our subcontractors when we have been
    named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The
    expenses, liabilities and receivables related to these claims
    are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties
    such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our
    markets, the types of products we build, claim settlement
    patterns, insurance industry practices and legal
    interpretations, among others. A 10% increase in the claim rate
    and the average cost per claim used to estimate the self-insured
    accruals would result in an increase of approximately
    $121.9 million in our accrual and a $81.8 million
    increase in our receivable resulting in additional expense of
    $40.1 million, while a 10% decrease in the claim rate and
    the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of
    approximately $94.4 million in our accrual and a
    $61.1 million decrease in our receivable resulting in a
    reduction in our expense of $33.3 million.

Income Taxes

— We calculate our income tax
    expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method, under
    which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on
    the tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their
    tax bases, and of tax loss and credit carryforwards. In
    assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods and
    in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events
    that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax
    returns, judgment is required. The accounting for deferred taxes
    is based upon an estimate of future results. Differences between
    the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax
    consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing
    tax laws also affect actual tax results and the valuation of
    deferred tax assets over time.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized in the financial statements as a component of income
    tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate
    uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions
    on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of
    factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in
    tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course
    of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in
    the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could
    result in material increases or decreases in our income tax
    expense in the period in which we make the change.

Stock-based Compensation

— From time to time,
    the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes
    the issuance of options to purchase our common stock to
    employees and directors. The committee approves grants out of
    amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally
    authorized by our common stockholders. Options are granted at
    exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock
    at the date of the grant. Generally, the options vest over
    periods of 3 to 9.75 years and expire 10 years after
    the dates on which they were granted.

We measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal
    to the fair value of share-based payments granted under
    compensation arrangements for all awards granted or modified
    after October 1, 2005, using the modified prospective
    method. Compensation expense for any unvested stock option
    awards outstanding as of October 1, 2005 is recognized on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. We
    calculate the fair value of stock options using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value
    of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in
    developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables.
    These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected
    stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected
    dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In
    addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of
    share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.



Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,”
    which requires additional disclosures about transfers between
    Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures
    about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
    forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
    This guidance was effective for us in fiscal 2010, except for
    the Level 3 activity disclosures, which are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. The
    adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only,
    did not and will not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-02,

“A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring
    Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring,” which clarifies when a
    loan modification or restructuring is considered a troubled debt
    restructuring. In determining whether a loan modification
    represents a troubled debt restructuring, a creditor must
    separately conclude that the restructuring constitutes a
    concession and that the debtor is experiencing financial
    difficulties. The guidance was effective for us on July 1,
    2011 and is to be applied retrospectively to the beginning of
    the annual period of adoption. The adoption of this guidance did
    not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-03,

“Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase
    Agreements.” This guidance amends the sale accounting
    requirement concerning a transferor’s ability to repurchase
    transferred financial assets even in the event of default by the
    transferee, which typically is facilitated in a repurchase
    agreement by the presence of a collateral maintenance provision.
    This guidance is effective prospectively for new transfers and
    existing transactions that are modified in the first interim or
    annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The
    adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-04,

“Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
    Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,” which
    provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that
    the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are
    similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance changes certain fair
    value measurement principles and expands the disclosure
    requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value
    measurements. The guidance is effective for us beginning
    January 1, 2012 and is to be applied prospectively. The
    adoption of this guidance, which relates primarily to
    disclosure, is not expected to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-05,

“Presentation of Comprehensive Income,” which requires
    that an entity report comprehensive income in either a single
    continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two
    sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two
    separate but continuous statements. As permitted, we elected to
    early adopt this guidance and did so in the current quarter. The
    adoption of this guidance, which relates to presentation only,
    did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-08,

“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,” which
    gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors
    to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current
    two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a
    result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely
    than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
    its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is
    required. As permitted, we elected to early adopt this guidance
    in the current quarter. The adoption of this guidance did not
    impact our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We
    monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize
    both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes
    in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt
    instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for
    variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not
    impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our
    future earnings and cash flows. Except in very limited
    circumstances, we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate
    debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and
    changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our
    cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we
    are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our
    mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk
    through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
    (MBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on
    MBS and EDFC. Use of the term “hedging instruments” in
    the following discussion refers to these securities
    collectively, or in any combination. We do not enter into or
    hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers
    who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit
    and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration
    of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to
    a specific purchaser through the use of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to
    being committed to third-party purchasers. The hedging
    instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as
    derivative instruments in an economic hedge, with gains and
    losses recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments
    related to funded, uncommitted loans are accounted for at fair
    value, with changes recognized in current earnings, along with
    changes in the fair value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The
    fair value change related to the hedging instruments generally
    offsets the fair value change in the uncommitted loans and the
    fair value change, which for the years ended September 30,
    2011, 2010 and 2009 was not significant, is recognized in
    current earnings. At September 30, 2011, hedging
    instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk related to
    uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs
    totaled $257.0 million. Uncommitted IRLCs totaled
    approximately $196.1 million, and uncommitted mortgage
    loans held for sale totaled approximately $80.9 million at
    September 30, 2011.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled
    maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair
    value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2011. The
    interest rate for our variable rate debt represents the interest
    rate on our mortgage repurchase facility. Because the mortgage
    repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage
    loans held for sale which are typically sold within
    60 days, its outstanding balance is included as a variable
    rate maturity in the most current period presented.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of operations and
    comprehensive income (loss), total equity, and cash flows
    present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of D.R. Horton, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30,
    2011 and 2010 and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    September 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
    Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A —

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc.
    and all of its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled
    subsidiaries (which are referred to as the Company, unless the
    context otherwise requires). All significant intercompany
    accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in
    consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior
    year’s financial statements to conform to classifications
    used in the current year. The statement of operations for the
    year ended September 30, 2010 has been revised to reflect
    the reclassification of depreciation expense related to rental
    properties of $1.2 million from homebuilding other income
    to selling, general and administrative expense. Additionally,
    the statement of cash flows for that year has been revised to
    reflect this reclassification.

Revenue
    Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized
    at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and
    possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In
    situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI
    Mortgage, the Company’s wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary,
    and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
    investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related
    mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser has been completed. At
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had deferred
    profit on these home sales in the amounts of $1.5 million
    and $2.0 million, respectively. Any profit on land sales is
    deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s
    title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered
    and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally
    occur simultaneously as each home is closed. The Company
    transfers substantially all underwriting risk associated with
    title insurance policies to third-party insurers. The Company
    typically elects the fair value option for its mortgage loan
    originations. Mortgage loans held for sale are initially
    recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or
    current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in
    fair value until the loan is sold. Net origination costs and
    fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time
    of origination. The expected net future cash flows related to
    the associated servicing of a loan are included in the
    measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted
    for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment.
    The Company generally does not retain or service originated
    mortgages; rather, it seeks to sell the mortgages and related
    servicing rights to third-party purchasers. Interest income is
    earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the
    loan is sold.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
    initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. Proceeds from home closings held for the
    Company’s benefit at title companies are included in
    homebuilding cash on the consolidated balance sheet.

Marketable
    Securities

The Company invests a portion of its cash on hand by purchasing
    marketable securities with maturities in excess of three months,
    and considers its investment portfolio to be

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, these



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

investments are recorded at fair value. At the end of a
    reporting period, unrealized gains and losses on these
    investments, net of tax, are recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet.
    Gains and losses realized upon the sale of marketable securities
    are determined by specific identification and are included in
    homebuilding other income. See Note B.

Restricted
    Cash

The Company has cash that is restricted as to its use.
    Restricted cash related to homebuilding operations includes cash
    used as collateral for outstanding letters of credit and
    customer deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance
    with regulatory requirements.

Inventories
    and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land
    development and home construction, capitalized interest, real
    estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during
    development and home construction. Costs incurred after
    development projects or homes are substantially complete, such
    as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling,
    general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All
    indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales
    personnel, division and region management, and the costs of
    advertising and builder’s risk insurance are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. The specific identification
    method is used for the purpose of accumulating home construction
    costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific
    construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are allocated on a pro-rata basis
    to the homes in the community benefiting from the relevant
    development activity, which generally relates to the remaining
    homes in the community.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not paid all
    incurred costs necessary to complete the home. A liability and a
    charge to cost of sales are recorded for the amount that is
    determined will ultimately be paid related to completed homes
    that have been closed. The home construction budgets are
    compared to actual recorded costs to determine the additional
    costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. The accrual is
    monitored by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in
    subsequent months to the amount previously accrued.

Each quarter, inventory is reviewed to determine whether
    recorded costs and any estimated costs required to complete each
    home or community are recoverable. If the review indicates that
    an impairment loss is required, an estimate of the loss is made
    and recorded to cost of sales in that quarter.

Land inventory and related communities under development are
    reviewed for potential write-downs when impairment indicators
    are present. The Company generally reviews its inventory at the
    community level and the inventory within each community is
    categorized as land held for development, residential land and
    lots developed and under development,

and/or

construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development. A particular
    community often includes inventory in more than one category. In
    certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for
    impairment purposes based on its product type (e.g. single
    family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels). In
    reviewing each of its communities, the Company determines if
    impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by
    analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to,
    the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community, the
    Company performs an analysis to determine if the undiscounted
    cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
    than their carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are
    required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less
    than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are
    significantly impacted by community specific factors including
    estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and
    estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor
    costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local
    market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of the Company’s communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by the Company and its competitors;

•

alternative uses for the Company’s land or communities such
    as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third
    parties;

•

amount of land and lots the Company owns or controls in a
    particular market or

sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The
    Company’s determination of fair value is primarily based on
    discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with
    the inherent risks associated with the assets and related
    estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a
    community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each
    lot in the community in the same manner as land and development
    costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each
    community is categorized as construction in progress and
    finished homes, residential land and lots developed and under
    development, and land held for development, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development.

The Company typically does not purchase land for resale.
    However, when the Company owns land or communities under
    development that no longer fit into its development and
    construction plans and it is determined that the best use of the
    asset is the sale of the asset, the project is accounted for as
    land held for sale, assuming the land held for sale criteria are
    met. The Company records land held for sale at the lesser of its
    carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In
    performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale,
    several factors are considered including, but not limited to,
    prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions, market
    analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing
    buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers
    received. If the estimated fair value less costs to sell an
    asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is
    written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.

Impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in
    substantially completed communities when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair
    values less estimated costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to asset valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. The Company’s quarterly assessments reflect
    management’s estimates and it continues to monitor the fair
    value of

held-for-sale

assets through the disposition date. See Note C.

Homebuilding
    Interest

The Company capitalizes homebuilding interest to inventory
    during active development and construction. Capitalized interest
    is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is
    delivered to the buyer. Additionally, the Company writes off a
    portion of the capitalized interest related to communities for
    which inventory impairments are

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded. The Company’s inventory under active development
    and construction was lower than its debt level during fiscal
    2011, 2010 and 2009; therefore, a portion of the interest
    incurred is reflected as interest expense.

The following table summarizes the Company’s homebuilding
    interest costs incurred, capitalized, expensed as interest
    expense, charged to cost of sales and written off during the
    years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

Land
    and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

The Company enters into land and lot option purchase contracts
    to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Under
    these contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in
    consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
    land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms.
    Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of the
    option deposits are not refundable at the Company’s
    discretion.

Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs incurred related to
    land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized if all of
    the following conditions have been met: (1) the costs are
    directly identifiable with the specific property; (2) the
    costs would be capitalized if the property were already
    acquired; and (3) acquisition of the property is probable,
    meaning the Company is actively seeking and has the ability to
    acquire the property, and there is no indication that the
    property is not available for sale. The Company considers the
    following when determining if the acquisition of the property is
    probable: (1) changes in market conditions subsequent to
    contracting for the purchase of the land; (2) current
    contract terms, including per lot price and required purchase
    dates; and (3) the Company’s current land position in
    the given market or

sub-market.

Option deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are
    expensed to cost of sales when the Company believes it is
    probable that it will no longer acquire the property under
    option and will not be able to recover these costs through other
    means.

Certain option purchase contracts result in the creation of a
    variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under
    option. The current guidance for determining which entity is the
    primary beneficiary is based on the ability of an entity to
    control both (1) the activities of a variable interest
    entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the
    entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Upon
    adoption of this guidance on October 1, 2010, all of the
    variable interest entities that were reported as land inventory
    not owned in the consolidated balance sheet at
    September 30, 2010 were deconsolidated because the Company
    determined it did not control the activities that most
    significantly impact the variable interest entity’s
    economic performance.

The maximum exposure to loss related to the Company’s
    variable interest entities is generally limited to the amounts
    of the Company’s option deposits. At September 30,
    2011 and 2010, the amount of option deposits related to these
    contracts totaled $13.2 million and $10.2 million,
    respectively, and are included in homebuilding other assets on
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful life



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of the asset. The depreciable life of model home furniture is
    2 years, depreciable lives of office furniture and
    equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years, and
    depreciable lives of buildings and improvements typically range
    from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
    $129.2 million and $150.8 million as of
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Depreciation
    expense was $19.9 million, $18.4 million and
    $25.7 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB)
    authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a
    three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation
    model of an asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy and its
    application to the Company’s assets and liabilities, is as
    follows:

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based on quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities

•

Level 2 — Valuation is determined from quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,
    quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets
    that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all
    significant inputs are observable in the market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is derived from model-based
    techniques in which at least one significant input is
    unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about
    the assumptions that market participants would use to value the
    asset or liability.

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in active
    markets to determine fair value. The Company considers the
    principal market and nonperformance risk associated with the
    Company’s counterparties when determining the fair value
    measurements, if applicable. Fair value measurements are used
    for the Company’s marketable securities, mortgage loans
    held for sale, interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and other
    derivative instruments on a recurring basis, and are used for
    inventories, other mortgage loans and real estate owned on a
    nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note F.

Goodwill

In September 2011, the Company early adopted the FASB’s
    authoritative guidance which allows an entity to assess
    qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of the
    two-step annual goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes,
    as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more
    likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds
    its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is
    not required. The Company performed a qualitative assessment of
    goodwill at September 30, 2011, and determined that the
    two-step process was not necessary. As a result of previous
    impairments, accumulated goodwill impairment losses at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010 totaled $553.5 million. As
    of September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s
    remaining goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of which
    related to its South Central reporting segment.

Warranty
    Claims

The Company typically provides its homebuyers with a ten-year
    limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such
    as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited
    warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited
    warranty on other construction components. Since the Company
    subcontracts its construction work to subcontractors who
    typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of
    insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims
    relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary
    responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have
    been established by charging cost of sales for each home
    delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s
    estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired
    warranty obligation periods. The Company’s warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which it operates, and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    built and the geographic areas in which they are built. See
    Note K.

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Insurance
    and Legal Claims

The Company records expenses and liabilities related to the
    costs for exposures related to construction defects and claims
    and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business,
    including employment matters, personal injury claims, land
    development issues and contract disputes. Also, the Company
    records expenses and liabilities for any estimated costs of
    potential construction defect claims and lawsuits (including
    expected legal costs), based on an analysis of the
    Company’s historical claims, which includes an estimate of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
    Related to the exposures for actual construction defect claims
    and estimates of construction defect claims incurred but not yet
    reported and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the
    ordinary course of business, the Company estimates and records
    insurance receivables for these matters under applicable
    insurance policies when recovery is probable. Additionally, the
    Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its legal
    expenses from its subcontractors when the Company has been named
    as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The
    expenses, liabilities and receivables related to these claims
    are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties
    such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the
    Company’s markets, the types of products it builds, claim
    settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal
    interpretations, among others. See Note K.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    expense was approximately $29.5 million, $39.3 million
    and $31.7 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s income tax expense (benefit) is calculated
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases,
    and of tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the
    realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods and
    in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events
    that have been recognized in the Company’s financial
    statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences
    between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax
    consequences could have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized in the financial statements as a component of income
    tax expense. Significant judgment is required to evaluate
    uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a
    number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances,
    changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during
    the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues.
    Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax
    positions could result in material increases or decreases in the
    Company’s income tax expense in the period in which the
    change is made. See Note G.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings, or loss, per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
    year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities
    outstanding during each year. See Note H.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

From time to time, the compensation committee of the
    Company’s board of directors authorizes the issuance of
    options to purchase the Company’s common stock to employees
    and directors. The committee approves grants out of amounts
    remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized
    by the common stockholders.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense at an
    amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted
    under compensation arrangements for all awards granted or
    modified after October 1, 2005, using the modified
    prospective method. Compensation expense for any unvested stock
    option awards outstanding as of October 1, 2005 is
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting
    period. The fair values of the options are calculated on the
    date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
    benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
    expense are reported in the Statement of Cash Flows as a
    financing cash flow. See Note J.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

“Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,”
    which requires additional disclosures about transfers between
    Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosures
    about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
    forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements.
    This guidance was effective for the Company in fiscal 2010,
    except for the Level 3 activity disclosures, which are
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2010. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to
    disclosure only, did not and will not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-02,

“A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring
    Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring,” which clarifies when a
    loan modification or restructuring is considered a troubled debt
    restructuring. In determining whether a loan modification
    represents a troubled debt restructuring, a creditor must
    separately conclude that the restructuring constitutes a
    concession and that the debtor is experiencing financial
    difficulties. The guidance was effective for the Company on
    July 1, 2011 and is to be applied retrospectively to the
    beginning of the annual period of adoption. The adoption of this
    guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-03,

“Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase
    Agreements.” This guidance amends the sale accounting
    requirement concerning a transferor’s ability to repurchase
    transferred financial assets even in the event of default by the
    transferee, which typically is facilitated in a repurchase
    agreement by the presence of a collateral maintenance provision.
    This guidance is effective prospectively for new transfers and
    existing transactions that are modified in the first interim or
    annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The
    adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-04,

“Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and
    Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,” which
    provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that
    the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are
    similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial
    Reporting Standards (IFRS). The guidance changes certain fair
    value measurement principles and expands the disclosure
    requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value
    measurements. The guidance is effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2012 and is to be applied
    prospectively. The adoption of this guidance, which relates
    primarily to disclosure, is not expected to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-05,

“Presentation of Comprehensive Income,” which requires
    that an entity report comprehensive income in either a single
    continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two
    sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two
    separate but continuous statements. As permitted, the Company
    elected to early adopt this guidance and did so in the current
    quarter. The adoption of this guidance, which relates to
    presentation only, did not impact the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU

2011-08,

“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other,” which
    gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors
    to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current
    two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a
    result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely
    than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
    its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is
    required. As permitted,

INVENTORY
    IMPAIRMENTS AND LAND OPTION COST WRITE-OFFS

During fiscal 2011, when the Company performed its quarterly
    inventory impairment analyses by reviewing the performance and
    outlook for all of its communities, the assumptions utilized
    reflected the Company’s expectation of continued
    challenging conditions and uncertainties in the homebuilding
    industry and in its markets. As of September 30, 2011, the
    Company evaluated communities with a combined carrying value of
    $391.5 million for impairment. The analysis of the majority
    of these communities assumed that sales prices in future periods
    will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in
    each community, or in comparable communities, in order to
    generate an acceptable absorption rate. For a minority of
    communities that the Company does not intend to develop or
    operate in current market conditions, some increases over
    current sales prices were assumed. While it is difficult to
    determine a timeframe for a given community in the current
    market conditions, the remaining lives of these communities were
    estimated to be in a range from six months to in excess of ten
    years. In performing this analysis, the Company utilized a range
    of discount rates for communities of 12% to 18%. Through this
    evaluation process, it was determined that communities with a
    carrying value of $37.1 million as of September 30,
    2011 were impaired. As a result, during the three months ended
    September 30, 2011, impairment charges of
    $10.2 million were recorded to reduce the carrying value of
    the impaired communities to their estimated fair value, as
    compared to $29.1 million in the same period of 2010.
    During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, impairment charges totaled
    $37.3 million, $62.3 million and $377.8 million,
    respectively. During fiscal 2011, approximately 78% of the
    impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots
    and land held for development, and approximately 22% of the
    charges were recorded to residential construction in progress
    and finished homes inventory, compared to 93% and 7%,
    respectively, in fiscal 2010 and 85% and 15%, respectively, in
    fiscal 2009.

The Company’s estimate of undiscounted cash flows from
    communities analyzed may change and could result in a future
    need to record impairment charges to adjust the carrying value
    of these assets to their estimated fair value. There are several
    factors which could lead to changes in the estimates of
    undiscounted future cash flows for a given community. The most
    significant of these include pricing and incentive levels
    actually realized by the community, the rate at which the homes
    are sold and the costs incurred to develop the lots and
    construct the homes. The pricing and incentive levels are often
    inter-related with sales pace within a community, such that a
    price reduction can typically be expected to increase the sales
    pace. Further, both of these factors are heavily influenced by
    the competitive pressures facing a given community from both new
    homes and existing homes, some of which may result from
    foreclosures. If conditions in the broader economy, homebuilding
    industry or specific markets in which the Company operates
    worsen, and as the Company re-evaluates specific community
    pricing and incentives, construction and development plans, and
    its overall land sale strategies, it may be required to evaluate
    additional communities or re-evaluate previously impaired
    communities for potential impairment. These evaluations may
    result in additional impairment charges.

At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had
    $26.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of land
    held for sale, consisting of land held for development and land
    under development that met the criteria of land held for sale.

During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company wrote off
    $8.1 million, $2.4 million and $29.9 million,
    respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to land option contracts which are not expected to
    be acquired.

    defined), holders of all series of notes issued prior to October
    2004, constituting $455.5 million principal amount in the
    aggregate as of September 30, 2011, have the right to
    require the Company to purchase these notes at a price of 101%
    of their principal amount, along with accrued and unpaid
    interest. If a fundamental change, including a change in control
    (as defined), occurs as defined in the indenture governing the
    convertible senior notes, holders of the convertible senior
    notes, constituting $500 million principal amount as of
    September 30, 2011, have the right to require the Company
    to purchase these notes at par, along with accrued and unpaid

    plus accrued interest, resulting in net losses on early
    retirement of debt of $10.8 million and $4.9 million
    in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included the write
    off of unamortized discounts and fees.

In October 2011, through unsolicited transactions, the Company
    repurchased $10.8 million principal amount of its
    6.5% senior notes due 2016, which further reduced the debt
    repurchase authorization.

During fiscal 2011, the Company provided a deed in lieu of
    foreclosure on a parcel of undeveloped land, which secured a
    non-recourse note payable, in exchange for a return of the note
    payable. The Company’s basis in the inventory parcel and
    the balance of the note were both $17.5 million. There was
    no gain or loss on the transaction.

The indentures governing the Company’s senior notes impose
    restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At
    September 30, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all
    of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the
    public debt obligations.

Financial
    Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a
    mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured
    financing. The mortgage repurchase facility provides financing
    and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase
    transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to
    the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the
    counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage
    then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased
    loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary
    market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days
    in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase
    facility. The total capacity of the facility is
    $100 million; however, through an amendment to the
    repurchase agreement, the capacity was increased to
    $150 million for the period from June 29, 2011 through
    October 20, 2011, after which time it returned to
    $100 million. The maturity date of the facility is
    March 4, 2012.

As of September 30, 2011, $251.5 million of mortgage
    loans held for sale were pledged under the mortgage repurchase
    facility. These mortgage loans had a collateral value of
    $236.3 million. DHI Mortgage has the option to fund a
    portion of its repurchase obligations in advance. As a result of
    advance paydowns totaling $119.8 million, DHI Mortgage had
    an obligation of $116.5 million outstanding under the
    mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2011 at a
    3.8% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the
    Company’s homebuilding debt. The facility contains
    financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum
    required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt
    to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity. At
    September 30, 2011, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all
    of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase
    facility.

NOTE E —

MORTGAGE
    LOANS

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage
    operations, the Company hedges its risk using various derivative
    instruments, which include forward sales of mortgage-backed
    securities (MBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put
    options on both MBS and EDFC. Use of the term “hedging
    instruments” in the following discussion refers to these
    securities collectively, or in any combination. The Company does
    not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative
    purposes.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family
    residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.
    Newly originated loans that have been closed but not committed
    to third-party purchasers are hedged to mitigate the risk of
    changes in their fair value. Hedged loans are committed to
    third-party purchasers typically within three days after
    origination. Approximately 89% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI
    Mortgage during fiscal 2011 were sold to two major financial
    institutions pursuant to their loan purchase agreements. Late in
    fiscal 2011, one of these financial institutions announced their
    intention to exit their correspondent lending business and will
    no longer purchase loans from the Company beyond December 2011.
    The Company has been negotiating with other institutions to
    establish new loan purchase agreements. With the combination of
    selling to potential new purchasers and increasing sales volumes
    to its existing purchasers, the Company expects to be able to
    continue to originate and sell mortgage loans at its current
    volumes.

At September 30, 2011, mortgage loans held for sale had an
    aggregate fair value of $294.1 million and an aggregate
    outstanding principal balance of $284.6 million. At
    September 30, 2010, mortgage loans held for sale had an
    aggregate fair value of $253.8 million and an aggregate
    outstanding principal balance of $247.5 million. During the
    years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company
    had net gains on sales of loans of $41.6 million,
    $45.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, which
    includes the effect of recording recourse expense, as discussed
    below in “Other Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves,” of
    $11.6 million, $13.7 million and $33.2 million,
    respectively.

The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge
    mortgage loans held for sale vary in relationship to the
    underlying loan amounts, depending on the movements in the value
    of each hedging instrument

relative to the value of the underlying mortgage loans. The fair
    value change related to the hedging instruments generally
    offsets the fair value change in the mortgage loans held for
    sale, which for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010
    and 2009 was not significant, and is recognized in current
    earnings. As of September 30, 2011, the Company had
    $80.9 million in mortgage loans held for sale not committed
    to third-party purchasers and the notional amounts of the
    hedging instruments related to those loans totaled
    $78.4 million.

Other
    Mortgage Loans and Loss Reserves

Mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions which
    include industry-standard representations and warranties,
    primarily involving the absence of misrepresentations by the
    borrower or other parties, insurability if applicable and,
    depending on the agreement, may include requiring a minimum
    number of payments to be made by the borrower. The Company
    generally does not retain any other continuing interest related
    to mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. Other mortgage
    loans generally consist of loans repurchased due to these
    limited recourse obligations. Typically, these loans are
    impaired and often become real estate owned through the
    foreclosure process. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the
    Company’s total other mortgage loans and real estate owned,
    before loss reserves were as follows:

Based on historical performance and current housing and credit
    market conditions, the Company has recorded reserves for
    estimated losses on other mortgage loans, real estate owned and
    future loan repurchase obligations due to the limited recourse
    provisions, all of which are recorded as reductions of financial
    services revenue. The reserve balances at September 30,

A subsidiary of the Company reinsured a portion of the private
    mortgage insurance written on loans originated by DHI Mortgage
    in prior years. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, reserves
    for expected future losses under the reinsurance program totaled
    $0.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and are
    included in financial services accounts payable and other
    liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. It
    is possible that future losses may exceed the amount of reserves
    and, if so, additional charges will be required.

Loan
    Commitments and Related Derivatives

The Company is party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs)
    which are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan
    funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. At
    September 30, 2011, IRLCs, which are accounted for as
    derivative instruments recorded at fair value, totaled
    $217.5 million.



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs
    through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments
    and hedging instruments. These instruments are considered
    derivatives in an economic hedge and are accounted for at fair
    value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. As
    of September 30, 2011, the Company had approximately
    $21.4 million of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments and $178.6 million of hedging instruments
    related to IRLCs not yet committed to purchasers.

NOTE F —

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company’s marketable securities consist of
    U.S. Treasury securities, government agency securities,
    corporate debt securities, foreign government securities and
    certificates of deposit. The fair value of U.S. Treasury
    securities is based on quoted prices for identical assets and
    therefore, they have been classified as a Level 1
    valuation. Obligations of government agencies, corporate debt
    securities, foreign government securities and certificates of
    deposit are valued using quoted market prices of recent
    transactions or quoted market prices of transactions in very
    similar securities and therefore, are classified as Level 2
    valuations.

The value of mortgage loans held for sale includes changes in
    estimated fair value from the date the loan is closed until the
    date the loan is sold. The fair value of mortgage loans held for
    sale is generally calculated by reference to quoted prices in
    secondary markets for commitments to sell mortgage loans with
    similar characteristics; therefore, they have been classified as
    a Level 2 valuation. After consideration of nonperformance
    risk, no additional adjustments have been made to the fair value
    measurement of mortgage loans held for sale. Closed mortgage
    loans are typically sold within 30 days of origination,
    which limits exposure to nonperformance by loan buyer
    counterparties to a short time period. In addition, the Company
    actively monitors the financial strength of its counterparties
    and has limited the number of counterparties utilized in loan
    sale transactions due to the current market volatility in the
    mortgage and bank environment.

The hedging instruments utilized to manage interest rate risk
    and hedge the changes in the fair value of mortgage loans held
    for sale are publicly traded derivatives with fair value
    measurements based on quoted market prices. Exchange-traded
    derivatives are considered Level 1 valuations because
    quoted prices for identical assets are used for fair value
    measurements.

Over-the-counter

derivatives, such as forward sales of MBS, are classified as
    Level 2 valuations because quoted prices for similar assets
    are used for fair value measurements. The Company mitigates
    exposure to nonperformance risk associated with

over-the-counter

derivatives by limiting the number of counterparties and
    actively monitoring their financial strength and
    creditworthiness while requiring them to be well-known
    institutions with credit ratings equal to or better than AA- or
    equivalent. Further, the Company’s derivative contracts
    typically have short-term durations with maturities from one to
    four months. Accordingly, the Company’s risk of
    nonperformance relative to its derivative positions is also not
    significant. Nonperformance risk associated with exchange-traded
    derivatives is considered minimal as these items are traded on
    the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After consideration of
    nonperformance risk, no additional adjustments have been made to
    the fair value measurement of hedging instruments.

The fair values of IRLCs are also calculated by reference to
    quoted prices in secondary markets for commitments to sell
    mortgage loans with similar characteristics; therefore, they
    have been classified as Level 2 valuations. These
    valuations do not contain adjustments for expirations as any
    expired commitments are excluded from the fair value
    measurement. After consideration of nonperformance risk, no
    additional adjustments have been made to the fair value
    measurements of IRLCs. The Company generally only issues IRLCs
    for products that meet specific purchaser guidelines. Should any
    purchaser become insolvent, the Company would not be required to
    close the transaction based on the terms of the commitment.
    Since not all IRLCs will become closed loans, the Company
    adjusts its fair value measurements for the estimated amount of
    IRLCs that will not close.

Inventory held and used is reported at the lower of carrying
    value or fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The factors
    considered in determining fair values of the Company’s
    communities are described in the discussion of the
    Company’s inventory impairment analysis (see Note C),
    and are classified as Level 3 valuations. Inventory held
    and used measured at fair value represents those communities for
    which the Company has recorded impairments during the current
    period.

Real estate owned and the majority of other mortgage loans are
    measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis. Other mortgage loans include performing and
    nonperforming mortgage loans. The fair values of other mortgage

    Company’s assessment of the value of the underlying

The income tax benefit in fiscal 2011 was due to the Company
    reducing its accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and
    corresponding interest by $61.4 million, partially offset
    by an accrual for state income taxes of $1.7 million. In
    fiscal 2010, a tax law change regarding net operating loss (NOL)
    carrybacks resulted in an income tax benefit of
    $208.3 million, which was partially offset by an increase
    in unrecognized tax benefits and state income tax expense.

The Company does not have meaningful effective tax rates in
    fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 because its net deferred tax
    assets are offset fully by a valuation allowance. The difference
    between income tax expense (benefit)

Deferred tax assets of $241.3 million for NOL carryforwards
    as of September 30, 2011 were reduced by $3.1 million
    for excess tax benefits related to the exercise of stock
    options. The excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock
    options will result in an increase to additional paid-in capital
    when the excess tax benefits reduce current income taxes payable.

At September 30, 2011, the Company had federal NOL
    carryforwards of $436.2 million that expire in fiscal 2030
    and 2031. Also at September 30, 2011, the Company had tax
    benefits for state NOL carryforwards of



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$88.7 million that expire (beginning at various times
    depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal 2013 to fiscal
    2031. At September 30, 2011, the Company had federal tax
    credit carryforwards of $3.2 million that expire in fiscal
    years 2029 through 2031.

The Company has been in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss
    position at the end of each fiscal year since fiscal 2008 due to
    challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry. At
    the end of fiscal 2011 the amount of the cumulative three-year
    pre-tax loss was $445 million. A cumulative loss in recent years
    is significant negative evidence that generally indicates a
    valuation allowance is required for some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets. Since the Company cannot overcome the
    significant negative evidence of its cumulative loss with
    positive evidence of recoverability, the Company has recorded a
    valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of its
    deferred tax assets. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the
    Company had net deferred tax assets of $848.5 million and
    $902.6 million, respectively, offset by valuation
    allowances of $848.5 million and $902.6 million,
    respectively.

The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets
    ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable
    income in future periods. The Company continues to analyze the
    positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a
    valuation allowance with respect to its deferred tax assets on a
    jurisdictional basis. The valuation allowance could be reduced
    in future periods if there is sufficient evidence to support a
    conclusion that it is not needed for some portion or all of the
    deferred tax assets. Realization of a significant portion of the
    Company’s deferred tax assets for state NOL carryforwards
    is more unlikely than the remaining deferred tax assets due to
    the need to generate a substantially higher level of taxable
    income prior to the expirations of the various state
    carryforward periods which expire sooner than the federal NOL
    carryforwards. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon
    estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated
    and actual outcomes of these future results could have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations or financial position.

Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the
    benefits recognized for accounting purposes. A reconciliation of
    the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is
    as follows:

At September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 all tax positions, if
    recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax
    rate. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits to
    $65.0 million at September 30, 2010 from
    $17.8 million at September 30, 2009 resulted in large
    part from the Company’s election to carryback its fiscal
    2009 NOL to fiscal 2004 and 2005, thereby reopening those
    previously closed years to further tax assessments. The decrease
    in unrecognized tax benefits to $16.3 million at
    September 30, 2011 from $65.0 million at
    September 30, 2010 resulted from the Company receiving a
    favorable result from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a
    ruling request concerning the capitalization of inventory costs
    and a reduction in its accrual for state income tax issues.

The Company classifies interest expense and penalties on income
    taxes as income tax expense. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    the Company recognized interest expense (benefit) related to
    unrecognized tax benefits of ($12.7) million,
    $11.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in its
    consolidated statements of operations. At September 30,
    2011 and 2010, the Company’s total accrued interest expense
    relating to unrecognized tax benefits was $5.1 million and
    $17.8 million, respectively, and there were no accrued
    penalties. As a result of the Company’s



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets, all
    accrued interest expense would affect the Company’s annual
    effective tax rate if the associated tax positions were
    recognized.

A reduction of $2.5 million in the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits and accrued interest with respect to state issues
    is reasonably possible within the next 12 months and would
    result in an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of
    operations.

The Company is subject to federal income tax and to income tax
    in multiple states. The statute of limitations for the
    Company’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for
    examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2011. The Company is
    currently being audited by the IRS for fiscal years 2006 and
    2007, and by various states. Its federal NOL refunds from fiscal
    2008 and 2009 are subject to Congressional Joint Committee
    review.

    10.2 million shares of common stock were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 and
    2010, respectively, because the exercise price was greater than
    the average market price of the common shares and, therefore,
    their effect would have been antidilutive. All outstanding stock
    options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings
    per share for fiscal 2009 because they were antidilutive due to
    the net loss recorded during that year. Additionally, the
    convertible senior notes were excluded from the computation of
    diluted earnings per share for all three years because they were

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred
    Compensation

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all employees who have been
    with the Company for a period of six months or more. The Company
    matches portions of employees’ voluntary contributions.
    Additional employer contributions in the form of profit sharing
    may also be made at the Company’s discretion. Expenses for
    the plan were $3.9 million, $4.8 million and
    $3.9 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
    is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides
    benefits payable to certain management employees upon
    retirement, death, or termination of employment. Under the SERP,
    the Company accrues an unfunded benefit based on a percentage of
    the eligible employees’ salaries, as well as an interest
    factor based upon a predetermined formula. The Company’s
    liabilities related to the SERP were $17.3 million and
    $15.2 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. The Company recorded $2.9 million,
    $2.7 million and $2.2 million of expense for this plan
    in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a
    select group of employees. The participating employees designate
    investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not
    required to invest the contributions in the designated
    investments. The Company’s net liabilities related to the
    deferred compensation plan were $23.3 million and
    $24.6 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the
    employee contributions would have earned had the funds been
    invested in the designated investments. In fiscal 2011 and 2009,
    the Company recorded a reduction in expense of $0.7 million
    and $1.1 million, respectively, for this plan, and in
    fiscal 2010, it recorded expense of $2.1 million.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides
    eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of
    the Company at a discounted price of 85% of the fair market
    value of the stock on the designated dates of purchase. The
    price to eligible employees may be further discounted depending
    on the average fair market value of the stock during the period
    and certain other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the
    total fair market value of the common stock that an eligible
    employee may purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15%
    of the employee’s annual compensation or $25,000. Under the
    plan, employees purchased 91,350 shares for
    $0.9 million in fiscal 2011, 107,952 shares for
    $1.1 million in fiscal 2010 and 155,254 shares for
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2009.

Stock
    Options

The Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the
    granting of stock options to certain key employees to purchase
    shares of common stock. Options are granted at exercise prices
    which equal the market value of the Company’s common stock
    at the date of the grant. Generally, the options vest over
    periods of 3 to 9.75 years and expire 10 years after
    the dates on which they were granted.

During fiscal 2011 and 2009, stock options were granted to
    purchase a total of 6.2 million shares and 6.1 million
    shares, respectively, of common stock at the closing market
    price on the date of the grant. The Compensation Committee of
    the Company’s Board of Directors granted stock options to
    executive officers, other officers and certain employees, and
    the Company’s Board of Directors granted stock options to
    its outside directors. No stock options were granted during
    fiscal 2010. At September 30, 2011, there were
    12.1 million shares available for future grants under the
    Plan.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal
    2011, 2010 and 2009 was $0.9 million, $7.6 million and
    $4.6 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock
    option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying
    stock exceeds the option exercise price.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and
    exercisable at September 30, 2011 was $0.1 million and
    $0, respectively. Exercise prices for options outstanding at
    September 30, 2011, ranged from $9.03 to $36.92. The
    weighted average remaining contractual lives of options
    outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2011 were
    6.5 years and 4.0 years, respectively.

The weighted average fair value of grants made in fiscal 2011
    and 2009 was $3.98 and $3.89 per share, respectively. The fair
    values of the options granted were estimated on the date of
    their grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based
    on the following weighted average assumptions:

For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s compensation
    expense related to stock option grants was $14.2 million,
    $13.3 million and $13.7 million, respectively, and at
    September 30, 2011, there was $57.2 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 5.0 years.

Incentive
    Bonus Plan

The Company’s Incentive Bonus Plan provides for the
    Compensation Committee to award short-term performance bonuses
    to senior management based upon the level of achievement of
    certain criteria. For fiscal 2011, the Compensation Committee
    approved an award whereby senior management could earn a
    quarterly performance bonus based upon a certain percentage of
    the Company’s quarterly pre-tax income. Subsequent to
    September 30, 2011, the Compensation Committee exercised
    its discretion and reduced the total amount awarded under the
    Incentive Bonus Plan to $0.5 million for fiscal 2011.

Restricted
    Stock Unit Agreement

In September 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors adopted and approved a form of Restricted Stock Unit
    Agreement (RSU Agreement) for awards to executive officers and
    other key employees pursuant to the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.
    Under the form of RSU Agreement, the Compensation Committee may
    award performance or service (time) based restricted stock units
    subject to the terms and conditions of the RSU Agreement and the
    2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

In September 2010, the Compensation Committee approved and
    granted awards of 200,000 performance based restricted stock
    units (Performance RSUs) that vest at the end of a two-year
    performance period ending September 30, 2012. The number of
    units that ultimately vest depends on the Company’s
    relative position as compared to its peers at the end of the
    two-year period in achieving certain performance criteria and
    can range from 0% to 200% of the number of units granted. The
    performance criteria are total shareholder return, return on
    investment, SG&A expense containment and gross profit. Each
    Performance RSU represents the contingent right to receive one
    share of the Company’s common stock if the vesting
    conditions are satisfied. The Performance RSUs have no dividend
    or voting rights during the performance period. The fair value
    of these awards on the date of grant is $11.53 per unit.
    Compensation expense related to these grants was
    $1.2 million in fiscal 2011.

In November 2010, the Compensation Committee approved and
    granted awards of 300,000 performance based units (Performance
    Units) that vest at the end of a three-year performance period
    ending September 30, 2013. The number of units that
    ultimately vest depends on the Company’s relative position
    as compared to its peers at the end of the three-year period in
    achieving certain performance criteria and can range from 0% to
    200% of the number of units granted. The performance criteria
    are total shareholder return, return on investment, SG&A
    expense containment and gross profit. The earned awards will
    have a value equal to the number of earned units multiplied by
    the closing price of the Company’s common stock at the end
    of the performance period and may be paid in cash, equity or a
    combination of both. The Compensation Committee has the
    discretion to reduce the final payout on the Performance Units
    from the amount earned. The Performance Units have no dividend
    or voting rights during the performance period. The fair value
    of these awards on the date of grant was $12.69 per unit. The
    liability for these awards of $1.0 million at
    September 30, 2011 was based on the Company’s
    performance against the peer group, the elapsed portion of the
    performance period and the Company’s stock price at the end
    of the period. Compensation expense related to these grants was
    $1.0 million in fiscal 2011.

Performance
    Unit Plan

The Company’s Performance Unit Plan provides for the
    Compensation Committee to award performance units to senior
    management based upon the level of achievement of certain
    criteria. Performance units were granted in 2008 and 2009 with

33-month

performance periods ending on September 30, 2010 and 2011,
    respectively. The actual number of performance units earned is
    based upon the Company’s level of achievement on defined
    performance metrics as compared to its peer group. The earned
    award will have a value equal to the number of earned units
    multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s common
    stock at the end of the performance period and may be paid in
    cash, equity or a combination of both. The Compensation
    Committee has the discretion to reduce the final payout on the
    performance units from the amount earned.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Compensation
    Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the amount earned
    under the 2008 performance unit grant to 437,500 performance
    units which had a value of $4.9 million based on the
    Company’s stock price at September 30, 2010. In
    November 2010, the Company issued shares of its common stock to
    satisfy the award.

Subsequent to September 30, 2011, the Compensation
    Committee exercised its discretion and reduced the amount earned
    under the 2009 performance unit grant to 551,250 performance
    units which had a value of $5.0 million based on the
    Company’s stock price at September 30, 2011. The
    liability related to this grant was $5.0 million at
    September 30, 2011. Compensation expense related to this
    grant was $0.9 million in fiscal 2011.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Warranty
    Claims

At September 30, 2011, the Company had liabilities of
    $0.8 million for the remaining repair costs of homes in its
    Florida and Louisiana markets constructed during 2005 through
    2007 which contain or are suspected to contain allegedly
    defective drywall manufactured in China (Chinese Drywall) that
    may be responsible for accelerated corrosion of certain metals
    in the home. Through September 30, 2011, the Company has
    spent approximately $6.4 million to remediate these homes.
    While the Company will seek reimbursement for these remediation
    costs from various sources, it has not recorded a receivable for
    potential recoveries as of September 30, 2011. If
    additional homes in these or other markets are found to contain
    Chinese Drywall, the Company would likely be required to further
    increase its warranty reserve for this matter in the future. The
    Company has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits in
    Louisiana and Florida pertaining to Chinese Drywall. As these
    actions are still in their early stages, the Company is unable
    to express an opinion as to the amount of damages, if any,
    beyond what has been reserved for repair as discussed above.

Insurance
    and Legal Claims

The Company has, and requires the majority of the subcontractors
    it uses to have, general liability insurance which includes
    construction defect coverage. The Company’s general
    liability insurance policies protect it against a portion of its
    risk of loss from construction defect and other claims and
    lawsuits, subject to self-insured retentions and other coverage
    limits. For policy years ended June 30, 2004 through 2011,
    the Company is self-insured for up to $22.5 million of the
    aggregate indemnity claims incurred, at which point the excess
    loss insurance begins, depending on the policy year. Once the
    Company has satisfied the annual aggregate limits, it is
    self-insured for the first $0.25 million to
    $1.0 million of indemnity for each claim occurrence,
    depending on the policy year. For policy years 2011 and 2012,
    the Company is self-insured for up to $15.0 million of the
    aggregate indemnity claims incurred and for up to
    $0.5 million of each claim occurrence thereafter.

In some states where the Company believes it is too difficult or
    expensive for its subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, the Company has waived its normal subcontractor
    general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower costs
    from subcontractors. In these states, the Company purchases
    insurance policies from either third-party carriers or its
    wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and names certain
    subcontractors as additional insureds. The policies issued by
    the captive insurance subsidiary represent self-insurance of
    these risks by the Company and are considered in the
    self-insured amounts above. For policy years after April 2007,
    the captive insurance subsidiary has $15.0 million of risk
    transfer with a third-party insurer.

The Company is self-insured for the deductible amounts under its
    workers’ compensation insurance policies. The deductibles
    vary by policy year, but in no years exceed $0.5 million
    per occurrence. The deductible for the 2011 and 2012 policy
    years is $0.5 million per occurrence.

The Company has been named as a defendant in various claims,
    complaints and other legal actions including construction defect
    claims on closed homes and other claims and lawsuits incurred in
    the ordinary course of business, including employment matters,
    personal injury claims, land development issues, contract
    disputes and

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

claims related to its mortgage activities. The Company has
    established reserves for these contingencies, based on the
    expected costs of the claims. The Company’s estimate of the
    required reserve is based on the facts and circumstances of
    individual pending claims and historical data and trends,
    including costs relative to revenues, home closings and product
    types, and includes estimates of the costs of construction
    defect claims incurred but not yet reported. These reserve
    estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances
    of individual pending claims and historical data and trends
    change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the
    accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs. The
    Company’s liabilities for these items were
    $529.6 million and $571.3 million at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included
    in homebuilding accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Related to the contingencies for
    construction defect claims and estimates of construction defect
    claims incurred but not yet reported, and other legal claims and
    lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business, the
    Company estimates and records insurance receivables for these
    matters under applicable insurance policies when recovery is
    probable. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to
    recover a portion of its legal expenses from its subcontractors
    when the Company has been named as an additional insured on
    their insurance policies. Estimates of the Company’s
    insurance receivables related to these matters totaled
    $218.3 million and $251.5 million at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included
    in homebuilding other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
    Expenses related to these items were approximately
    $28.1 million, $43.2 million and $58.3 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing
    reserves for these contingencies, it is not possible for the
    Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or
    range of loss in excess of its reserves. To the extent the
    losses arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds management’s estimates reflected in the recorded
    reserves relating to these matters, the Company would incur
    additional charges that could be significant.

During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an out-of-period
    adjustment which had the effect of increasing home sales gross
    margin and net income by $5.3 million. The adjustment
    related to an error in recording the loss reserves of the
    Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. The
    unadjusted amounts from prior periods are considered to be
    immaterial to the prior periods and the out-of-period adjustment
    is not material to the current fiscal year’s financial
    statements.

Land
    and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

The Company enters into land and lot option purchase contracts
    in order to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes.
    At September 30, 2011, the Company had total deposits of
    $14.6 million, consisting of cash deposits of
    $12.7 million and promissory notes and surety bonds of
    $1.9 million, to purchase land and lots with a total
    remaining purchase price of $918.7 million. Within the land
    and lot option purchase contracts at September 30, 2011,
    there were a limited number of contracts, representing
    $8.2 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require the Company to
    purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their
    obligations. The majority of land and lots under contract are
    currently expected to be purchased within three years, based on
    the Company’s assumptions as to the extent it will exercise
    its options to purchase such land and lots.

Other
    Commitments

To secure performance under various contracts, the Company had
    outstanding letters of credit of $46.9 million and surety
    bonds of $689.2 million at September 30, 2011. The
    Company has secured letter of credit agreements that require it
    to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the balance of
    letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing
    banks. At September 30, 2011 and 2010, the amount of cash
    restricted for this purpose totaled $47.5 million and
    $52.6 million, respectively, and is included in
    homebuilding restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The Company’s 29 homebuilding operating divisions and its
    financial services operation are its operating segments. The
    homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into six
    reporting segments and the financial services operating segment
    is its own reporting segment. The Company’s reportable
    homebuilding segments are: East, Midwest, Southeast, South
    Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have
    homebuilding operations located in the following states:

East:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, New Mexico (Las Cruces only), Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating 98%
    of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. The
    Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily engaged in
    the acquisition and development of land and the construction and
    sale of residential homes on the land, in 25 states and 73
    markets in the United States. The homebuilding segments generate
    most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes, and to
    a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage
    financing and title agency services primarily to the
    Company’s homebuilding customers. The Company generally
    does not retain or service originated mortgages; rather, it
    seeks to sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to
    third-party purchasers. The financial services segment generates
    its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and
    collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.

Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of
    interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized
    to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related
    to operating the Company’s corporate office. The
    amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is
    allocated to each segment based on the segment’s revenue,
    while interest expense and those expenses associated with the
    corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the
    segment’s inventory balances.

In the past, the Company experienced variability in its results
    of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature
    of its homebuilding business. Historically, the Company has
    closed a greater number of homes in the third and fourth (June
    and September) fiscal quarters than in the first and second
    (December and March) fiscal quarters. As a result, revenues and
    net income typically have been higher in the third and fourth
    quarters of the fiscal year. Although the weakness in
    homebuilding market conditions during the past several years
    mitigated these historical seasonal variations, this seasonal
    pattern resumed in fiscal 2011. However, the Company can make no
    assurances as to whether this pattern will continue in the
    future.

Gross profit during fiscal 2011 was reduced by inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs of $8.4 million, $14.3 million,
    $9.9 million and $12.8 million in the first, second,
    third and fourth quarters, respectively. Gross profit during
    fiscal 2010 was reduced by inventory impairment charges and
    write-offs of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs
    of $1.2 million, $2.4 million, $30.3 million and
    $30.8 million in the first, second, third and fourth
    quarters, respectively.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that
    evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or
    otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed
    in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure.

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2011 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal
    control over financial reporting is a process to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
    limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
    concluded that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2011.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011,
    as stated in their report included herein.
