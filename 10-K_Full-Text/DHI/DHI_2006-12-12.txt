PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the
    United States, based on our domestic homes closed during the
    twelve months ended September 30, 2006. We construct and
    sell high quality homes through our operating divisions in
    27 states and 84 metropolitan markets of the United States,
    primarily under the name of D.R. Horton,

America’s
    Builder.

D.R. Horton, Inc. is a Fortune 500 company,
    and our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and
    listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
    “DHI.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the
    terms “D.R. Horton,” the “Company,”
    “we” and “our” used herein refer to D.R.
    Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and
    subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In
    1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and
    businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential
    home construction and development companies owned or controlled
    by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public
    offering of our common stock. From inception, we have
    consistently grown the size of our company by investing our
    available capital into our existing homebuilding markets and
    into

start-up

operations in new markets. Additionally, we have acquired
    numerous other homebuilding companies, which have strengthened
    our market position in existing markets and expanded our
    geographic presence and product offerings in other markets. The
    effectiveness of our organic growth and acquisition strategies
    enabled us to become the largest homebuilding company in the
    United States, a distinction we have maintained for our
    last five fiscal years. Our homes generally range in size from
    1,000 to 5,000 square feet and in price from $90,000 to
    $900,000. For the year ended September 30, 2006, we closed
    53,099 homes with an average closing sales price of
    approximately $273,900.

Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage
    banking and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our
    homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    provides mortgage financing services, principally to purchasers
    of homes we build and sell. We originate mortgage loans, then
    package and sell them and their servicing rights to third-party
    investors shortly after origination on a non-recourse or limited
    recourse basis. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title
    insurance agents by providing title insurance policies,
    examination and closing services, primarily to purchasers of
    homes we build and sell.

Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding
    segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding
    operations are by far the most substantial part of our business,
    comprising approximately 98% of consolidated revenues and
    approximately 95% of consolidated income before income taxes in
    fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006, our total consolidated revenues
    were $15.1 billion, and our total consolidated income
    before income taxes was $2.0 billion. Our homebuilding
    reporting segments generate most of their revenues from the sale
    of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land
    and lots. In addition to building traditional single-family
    detached homes, the homebuilding segments also build attached
    homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums
    (including some mid-rise buildings), which share common walls
    and roofs. The sale of detached homes generated approximately
    80%, 83%, and 84% of home sales revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. Our financial services segment generates
    its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and
    collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.

We make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our
    Internet website all of our reports required to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports include

Operating
    Strategy

Our overall operating strategy has long been to take advantage
    of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitably
    through capturing greater market share, while continuing to
    maintain a strong balance sheet. To execute our strategy we have
    invested our available capital in our existing homebuilding
    markets through our capital allocation process and entered
    satellite markets as opportunities were available. We have also
    evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose.
    The market conditions in our homebuilding markets have softened
    considerably during the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2006. Although we believe the long-term fundamentals which
    support home sales demand remain solid and the current negative
    conditions in many of our markets will moderate over time, we
    cannot predict the duration and severity of the current market
    conditions. Consequently, while our long-term strategy remains
    to continue to profitably grow our homebuilding business, our
    focus while the market conditions are weaker will primarily be
    upon continued strengthening of the financial condition of the
    Company by reducing inventories of homes and land, thereby
    increasing liquidity.

Geographic
    Diversity

From 1978 to late 1987, our homebuilding activities were
    conducted in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We then began
    diversifying geographically by entering additional markets, both
    through

start-up

operations and acquisitions. We now operate in 27 states
    and 84 markets. This provides us with geographic diversification
    in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of
    revenues and earnings.

We believe our diversification strategy mitigates the effects of
    local and regional economic cycles and enhances our growth
    potential. Typically, we do not invest material amounts of
    capital in real estate, including raw land, developed lots,
    models and speculative homes or overhead in

start-up

operations in new markets, until such markets demonstrate growth
    potential and acceptance of our products. While we believe there
    are long-term growth opportunities in our existing markets, we
    also intend to continue our diversification strategy by seeking
    to selectively enter new markets, primarily through the opening
    of satellite operations in smaller markets near our existing
    operating divisions. We also continue to evaluate opportunities
    to enter new markets or strengthen our presence in our existing
    markets through acquisitions of other homebuilding companies.

Economies
    of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in
    terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2006. By the same
    measure, we are also either the largest or one of the five
    largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2006. We
    believe that our national, regional and local scale of
    operations has provided us with benefits that may not be
    available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders,
    such as:

•

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national,
    regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates
    from certain subcontractors;

•

Earlier opportunities on large land parcels, as land sellers may
    present parcels for sale to us sooner due to our strong presence
    in a market;

•

Efficient land entitlement processes, as we often dedicate
    full-time staff to work with municipalities to resolve difficult
    land and lot entitlement concerns; and

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong
    balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships
    with national commercial and investment banking institutions.

Our economies of scale have contributed to our strong
    homebuilding operating margins over the years. Our operating
    margins have provided us with operational flexibility to compete
    for additional market share in each of our markets and in new
    satellite markets versus our competitors with lower operating
    margins.


Decentralized
    Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give more
    operating flexibility to our local division presidents. At
    September 30, 2006, we had 41 separate homebuilding
    operating divisions, some of which are in the same market area
    and some of which operate in more than one market area.
    Generally, each operating division consists of a division
    president; land entitlement, acquisition and development
    personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel; a construction
    manager and construction superintendents; customer service
    personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager and office staff.
    We believe that division presidents and their management teams,
    who are familiar with local conditions, have better information
    on which to base decisions regarding local operations. Our
    division presidents receive performance bonuses based upon
    achieving targeted financial and operational measures in their
    operating divisions.

Operating
    Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other
    governmental requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite
    work required to meet local building codes;

•

Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction
    approvals;

•

Overseeing land development;

•

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•

Selecting and managing construction subcontractors and suppliers;

•

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules; and

•

Developing and implementing marketing plans.

Centralized
    Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business
    through our regional and corporate offices. We have seven
    separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional
    office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief
    financial officer, a purchasing manager and limited office
    support staff. Each of our region presidents and their
    management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations
    of up to eight homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Allocation of inventory investments within corporate guidelines;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division president
    compensation plans.


Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are
    responsible for establishing our operational policies and
    internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with
    established policies and controls throughout our operations. The
    corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct
    management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through
    the following centralized functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to
    regional homebuilding operations;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Accounting and management reporting;

•

Internal audit;

•

Information technology systems;

•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Management of major national or regional supply chain
    initiatives;

•

Monitoring and analysis of margins, returns and
    expenses; and

•

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of
    results.

Cost
    Management

We control our overhead costs by centralizing certain
    administrative and accounting functions and by closely
    monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management
    positions in our operating divisions, as well as in our regional
    and corporate offices. We also minimize advertising costs by
    participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real
    estate brokers.

We control construction costs by striving to design our homes
    efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction
    materials and labor. We also negotiate favorable pricing from
    our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of
    services and products we purchase from them on a local, regional
    and national basis. We monitor our construction costs on each
    house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems,
    and we monitor our inventory levels, margins, returns and
    expenses through our management information systems.

Acquisitions

We have recently focused on internal growth, strengthening our
    balance sheet and increasing our liquidity. However, as an
    integral component of our operational strategy, we continue to
    evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. We believe
    that, in some instances, expanding our operations through the
    acquisition of existing homebuilding companies can provide us
    benefits not found in

start-up

operations, such as:

•

Established land positions and inventories;

•

Existing relationships with municipalities, land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers;

•

Proven product acceptance by homebuyers; and

•

Immediate impact on our total home closings and revenues, which
    can provide improved costs in many parts of the company through
    volume pricing incentives in some of our national and regional
    purchasing contracts.

In evaluating potential acquisition candidates, we seek
    homebuilding companies that have excellent reputations, track
    records of profitability and strong management teams. We seek to
    limit the risks associated with acquiring such companies by
    conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due
    diligence on each


acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we
    believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an
    acceptable period of time. We believe that our acquisition
    evaluation and due diligence processes combined with our
    decentralized operating approach with centralized controls have
    contributed to the successful integration of our prior
    acquisitions.

Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic
    regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our
    mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. The
    names of the regions and the markets comprising each region
    reflect the aggregation of our homebuilding operating segments

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets, we
    consider the following local, market-specific factors, among
    others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Job growth;

•

Land availability;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

New home sales activity;

•

Competition;

•

Secondary home sales activity; and

•

Prevailing housing products, features and pricing.

Land
    Policies

Typically, we acquire land after we have completed appropriate
    due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights
    (“entitlements”) to begin development or construction
    work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots.
    Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other
    things, complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests,
    independent environmental studies and other engineering work,
    and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other
    governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
    property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop
    land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we also
    sell lots and land to other developers and homebuilders.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain
    the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots
    at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
    anticipated home closings or planned land development. Our
    option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our
    financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and
    lot sellers. This enables us to control significant land and lot
    positions with minimal capital investment, which substantially
    reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development.

Almost all of our land positions are acquired directly by us. We
    avoid entering into joint venture arrangements due to their
    increased costs and complexity, as well as the loss of
    operational control inherent in such arrangements. We are a
    party to a very small number of joint ventures that were
    acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders. All of
    these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial
    statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory
    risks by:

•

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned)
    in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing
    preferences and related economic developments, such as new job
    opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income
    trends;

•

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•

Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts,
    where possible;

•

Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional
    upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s
    receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory
    deposits from the buyer; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes
    under construction without an executed sales contract) built in
    each subdivision.


Construction

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets
    to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each
    community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features
    to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to
    allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold.

Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
    subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are retained for a
    specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
    subcontractor to complete construction at an agreed-upon price.
    Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use
    generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with
    other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials
    and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ construction
    superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate
    in major design and building decisions, coordinate the
    activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of
    subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor
    compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our
    construction superintendents play a significant role in working
    with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home
    modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction
    process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Construction time for our homes depends on the weather,
    availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home,
    and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a
    home within four to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of
    construction materials, except for work in progress materials
    for homes under construction. Typically, the construction
    materials used in our operations are readily available from
    numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
    certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
    at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
    have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of
    materials or labor that have materially affected our
    consolidated operating results.

Marketing
    and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and
    independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales
    from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each
    subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for
    sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel
    assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor
    plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting
    them with the selection of options and other custom features. We
    train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of
    financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising
    plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential
    homebuyers with one or more of a variety of incentives,
    including discounts and free upgrades, to be competitive in a
    particular market. In the current weak market conditions, we
    have significantly increased the level of incentives we are
    offering to homebuyers in many markets.

We advertise in our local markets as necessary. We advertise in
    newspapers, marketing brochures and newsletters. We also use
    billboards, radio and television advertising and our Internet
    website to market the location, price range and availability of
    our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate
    in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take
    advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe that model
    homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, so we
    expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in
    our model homes.

In addition to using model homes, in certain markets we build a
    limited number of speculative homes in each subdivision. These
    homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective
    homebuyers who are relocating to these markets, as well as to
    independent brokers, who often represent homebuyers requiring a
    completed home within 60 days. We determine our speculative
    homes strategy in each market based on local market factors,
    such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing
    demand, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends
    and our past experience in the market. We determine the number
    of speculative homes to build in each subdivision based on our
    current and planned sales pace, and we monitor


and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing basis as
    conditions warrant. We typically sell a substantial majority of
    our speculative homes while they are under construction or
    immediately following completion; however, the softness in the
    current market conditions and related high cancellation rates
    have increased our speculative homes inventory to approximately
    50% of our total homes in inventory as of September 30,
    2006, up from 41% as of September 30, 2005.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least
    $500. The amount of earnest money required varies between
    markets and subdivisions, and may significantly exceed $500.
    Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional
    deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their
    homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers
    cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain
    their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating
    divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits. Our sales
    contracts also include a financing contingency which permits
    customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if
    they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified
    interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may
    include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing
    home. Depending upon market conditions, the sales contracts used
    in certain subdivisions may also contain restrictions aimed at
    limiting purchases of our homes by speculative investors who
    plan to purchase our homes and then quickly place the homes up
    for resale. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations
    of sales contracts in fiscal 2006 were 28%, and our quarterly
    cancellation rates increased throughout fiscal 2006 to 40% in
    the fourth quarter, significantly higher than our typical
    historical range of 16% to 20%. The length of time between the
    signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home
    to the buyer (closing) averages between three and six months.

Customer
    Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality
    control inspections and responding to customers’
    post-closing needs. We believe that prompt and courteous
    response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction
    reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for
    quality and service, and ultimately leads to significant repeat
    and referral business from the real estate community and
    homebuyers. We provide our homebuyers with a limited one-year
    warranty on workmanship and building materials. The
    subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide
    us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to
    respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In
    addition, we typically provide a supplemental ten-year limited
    warranty that covers major construction defects, and some of our
    suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified
    products installed in the home.

Customer
    Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage
    coordinates and expedites the entire sales transaction by
    ensuring that mortgage commitments are received and that
    closings take place in a timely and efficient manner. DHI
    Mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of
    our homebuyers and, when necessary to fulfill the needs of some
    homebuyers, also brokers loans to third-party lenders who
    directly originate the mortgage loans. During the year ended
    September 30, 2006, approximately 94% of DHI
    Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our
    homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage provided mortgage
    financing services for approximately 68% of our total homes
    closed.

For loans that it originates, DHI Mortgage packages and sells
    the loans and their servicing rights to third-party investors
    shortly after origination on a non-recourse or limited recourse
    basis. In markets where we currently do not provide mortgage
    financing, we work with a variety of mortgage lenders that make
    available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing programs.

Title Services

We serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by
    providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
    services to purchasers of homes we build and sell, through our
    subsidiary title companies. We currently assume little or no
    underwriting risk associated with these title policies.


Employees

At September 30, 2006, we employed 8,772 persons, of whom
    1,432 were sales and marketing personnel, 2,764 were executive,
    administrative and clerical personnel, 2,846 were involved in
    construction and 1,730 worked in mortgage and title operations.
    We had fewer than 20 employees covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. Employees of some of the subcontractors which we use
    are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective
    bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our
    employees and subcontractors are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in
    each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and
    local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw
    materials, skilled labor and financing. We also compete with
    resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market.
    Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design,
    mortgage financing terms and location. Our financial services
    business competes with other mortgage lenders, including
    national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other
    financial institutions, some of which have greater access to
    capital markets, different lending criteria and potentially
    broader product offerings.

Governmental
    Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex
    regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
    zoning, density and development requirements, building,
    environmental, advertising and real estate sales rules and
    regulations. These requirements affect the development process,
    as well as building materials to be used, building designs and
    minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by
    local authorities where required, and homes eligible for
    insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA are subject
    to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad
    discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In
    addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various
    assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public
    improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of
    local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
    vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
    the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.

Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also
    comply with various federal and state laws and regulations.
    These include eligibility and other requirements for
    participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, GNMA,
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These also include required
    compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations
    such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against
    discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. All of
    these laws and regulations may subject our operations to
    examination by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. In prior
    years, we generally had more homes under construction, closed
    more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the
    third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal
    activity increases our working capital requirements for our
    homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters and increases our funding requirements for the
    mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the
    end of these quarters. As a result, our results of operations
    and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of
    our fiscal year.

In fiscal 2006, 57% of our consolidated revenues was
    attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters. In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to
    softening homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2006,
    only 46% of our consolidated operating income was attributable
    to operations in the third


and fourth fiscal quarters. This decrease was primarily due to
    the increased use of incentives to sell homes and inventory
    impairment charges and land option cost write-offs recorded
    during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. We expect
    that we will experience our historical seasonal patterns of
    revenues and operating income in future fiscal years.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

should be read together with the risk factors set forth below.
    They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or
    may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with
    other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the
    potential to affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material
    and adverse manner.

Because
    of the cyclical nature of our industry, changes in general
    economic, real estate construction or other business conditions
    could adversely affect our business or our financial
    results.

Cyclical Industry.

The homebuilding industry
    is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general
    and local economic conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

consumer confidence;

•

levels of new and existing homes for sale;

•

demographic trends; and

•

housing demand.

These may occur on a national scale or may affect some of the
    regions or markets in which we operate more than others. If
    adverse conditions affect any of our larger markets, they could
    have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other
    homebuilding companies.

An oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental
    properties and used or foreclosed homes, including homes held
    for sale by investors and speculators, can also depress new home
    prices and reduce our margins on the sales of new homes.

During fiscal 2006, the homebuilding industry experienced an
    industry-wide softening of demand for new homes. In many
    markets, home price appreciation over the past several years had
    attracted real estate investors and speculators. As price
    appreciation slowed in fiscal 2006, the demand from investors
    and speculators for new homes also slowed, resulting in an
    increase in new homes available for sale. At the same time,
    existing homes offered for sale by investors and speculators
    increased. In response to higher inventories of both new and
    existing homes, homebuilders increased the use of sales
    incentives to continue to sell new homes. In the third and
    fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, we experienced a decrease in our
    net sales orders due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer
    confidence and a related increase in sales contract
    cancellations, both of which we believe were caused by the
    continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by
    both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes. Our
    use of incentives also contributed to significantly lower gross
    margins on the homes we closed during those quarters. We cannot
    predict the duration or severity of the current market
    conditions, nor provide any assurances that the adjustments we
    have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions
    will be successful.

Risks Related to National Security.

Continued
    military deployments in the Middle East and other overseas
    regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to
    national security, and any corresponding response by the United
    States or others, or related domestic or international
    instability, may adversely affect general economic conditions or
    cause a slowdown of the national economy.


Inventory Risks.

Inventory risks are
    substantial for our homebuilding business. Our long-term ability
    to build homes depends upon our acquiring land suitable for
    residential building at affordable prices in locations where our
    potential customers want to live. We must anticipate demand for
    new homes and continuously seek and make acquisitions of land
    for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our
    current markets and for new markets. In some markets, this has
    become more difficult and costly.

The risks inherent in controlling or purchasing and developing
    land increase as consumer demand for housing decreases. Thus, we
    may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a
    cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot
    build and sell homes profitably. Our deposits for building lots
    controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk.
    The value of undeveloped land, building lots and housing
    inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of
    changing market conditions. In addition, inventory carrying
    costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or
    losses in a poorly performing project or market. In weak
    economic or market conditions, we may have to sell homes or land
    for a lower profit margin or at a loss, and we may have to
    record inventory impairment charges. We cannot make any
    assurances that the measures we employ to manage inventory risks
    and costs will be successful.

During fiscal 2005 and the first part of fiscal 2006, our goals
    for years of supply for ownership and control of land and
    building lots were based on management’s expectations for
    future volume growth. In light of the much weaker market
    conditions recently encountered, our expectations have changed
    and we have significantly slowed our purchases of land and lots
    to reduce our inventory to better match our new reduced rate of
    production. We have recently terminated numerous land option
    contracts and have written off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to these option contracts. We have
    also recorded inventory impairment charges related to some of
    our under-performing projects.

Supply Risks.

The homebuilding industry has
    from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can
    affect the cost or timing of construction, including:

•

shortages of qualified trades people;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, who may be inadequately
    capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly
    increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are
    significant components of home construction costs.

Risks from Nature.

Weather conditions and
    natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes,
    volcanic activity, droughts, floods and wildfires, can harm our
    homebuilding business. These can delay home closings, adversely
    affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or damage
    homes under construction. The climates and geology of many of
    the states in which we operate, including California, Florida
    and Texas, where we have some of our larger operations, present
    increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster.

Consequences.

As a result of the foregoing
    matters, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy
    our homes, or we may take longer or incur more costs to build
    them. We may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising
    prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we
    fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing home sales
    contracts. We may be unable to change the mix of our home
    offerings or the affordability of our homes to maintain our
    margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in
    other ways. In addition, cancellations of home sales contracts
    in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or do not honor
    their contracts. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal
    2006, we experienced an increase in sales contract cancellations
    due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer confidence, which we
    believe was caused by the continued increase in the level of
    sales incentives offered by both builders of new homes and
    sellers of existing homes. We are not certain how long the
    increased level of cancellations will continue.

Our financial services business is closely related to our
    homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans
    principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in
    the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may
    also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of
    our business. Consumer preferences for adjustable rate and other
    low-margin loans may also adversely affect our financial
    services


results. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages we
    originate may adversely affect the pricing we receive upon the
    sale of mortgages that we originate and our profitability on
    such loan sales.

Increases
    in interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability or
    increases in the effective costs of owning a home could prevent
    potential customers from buying our homes and adversely affect
    our business or our financial results.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through
    lenders providing mortgage financing. In recent years, interest
    rates have been at historical lows. Many homebuyers have also
    chosen adjustable rate, interest only or other mortgages that
    involve initial lower monthly payments. As a result, new homes
    have been more affordable. Increases in interest rates or
    decreases in the availability of mortgage financing products,
    however, may adversely affect the market for new homes.
    Potential homebuyers may be less willing or able to pay the
    increased monthly costs or to obtain mortgage financing that
    exposes them to interest rate changes. Lenders may increase the
    qualification requirements needed for mortgages or adjust their
    terms to address any increased credit risk. Even if potential
    customers do not need financing, changes in interest rates and
    the availability of mortgage financing products may make it
    harder for them to sell their current homes to potential buyers
    who need financing. These matters may adversely affect the sales
    or pricing of our homes and may also reduce the volume or
    margins in our financial services business. The impact on our
    financial services business may be compounded to the extent we
    are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have
    committed to originate through the various hedging strategies we
    employ.

We believe that the availability of FHA and VA mortgage
    financing is an important factor in marketing some of our homes.
    We also believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and
    Freddie Mac to the mortgage industry is important to the housing
    market; however, the federal government has sought to limit the
    size of the home-loan portfolios and operations of these two
    government-sponsored enterprises. Any limitations or
    restrictions on the availability of the financing or on the
    liquidity provided by them could adversely affect interest
    rates, mortgage financing and our sales of new homes and
    mortgage loans.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage
    interest expense and real estate taxes, generally are deductible
    expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases
    state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under
    current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state
    government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed,
    to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax
    deductions, the after-tax cost of owning a new home could
    increase for many of our potential customers. The resulting loss
    or reduction of homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law
    changes were enacted without offsetting provisions, could
    adversely impact demand for and sales prices of new homes.

Governmental
    regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability
    of our development and homebuilding projects or affect our
    related financial services operations and adversely affect our
    business or our financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect
    land development and home construction, including zoning,
    density restrictions, building design and building standards.
    These regulations often provide broad discretion to the
    administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we
    must meet prior to being approved, if approved at all. We are
    subject to determinations by these authorities as to the
    adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads or other local
    services. In addition, in many markets government authorities
    have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of
    these can limit, delay or increase the costs of development or
    homebuilding.

New housing developments may be subject to various assessments
    for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements, which
    could cause an increase in the effective prices for our homes.
    In addition, increases in property tax rates by local
    governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced
    federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
    potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to
    purchase new homes.

We are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The impact of environmental laws varies depending
    upon the prior uses of


the building site or adjoining properties and may be greater in
    areas with less supply where undeveloped land or desirable
    alternatives are less available. These matters may result in
    delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance,
    remediation and other costs, and can prohibit or severely
    restrict development and homebuilding activity in
    environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

Our financial services operations are also subject to numerous
    federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include
    eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan
    programs, compliance with consumer lending and similar
    requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions
    against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures.
    They may also subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies. These factors may limit our ability to
    provide mortgage financing or title services to potential
    purchasers of our homes.

Our
    substantial debt could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30,
    2006, our consolidated debt was $6,078.6 million. In the
    ordinary course of business, we may incur significant additional
    debt, to the extent permitted by our revolving credit facility
    and our indentures.

Possible Consequences.

The amount of our debt
    could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements or other requirements;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payment of our debt and reduce our ability to
    use our cash flow for other purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the
    changes in our business;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt
    than some of our competitors; and

•

make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our
    business or in general economic conditions.

Dependence on Future Performance.

Our ability
    to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon
    our future financial performance. We are engaged in businesses
    that are substantially affected by changes in economic
    conditions. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of
    general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our
    businesses are also affected by financial, political, business
    and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
    factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect
    our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through
    the sale of debt or equity securities, the refinancing of debt,
    or the sale of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may
    affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations, because
    borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at floating
    rates and our “interest rate swap” agreements fix our
    interest rate for only a portion of these borrowings.

As of September 30, 2006, the scheduled maturities of
    principal on our outstanding debt for the subsequent
    12 months totaled $1,217.8 million, including
    $1,191.7 million in financial services debt that must be
    renewed annually. Based on the current level of operations, we
    believe our cash flow from operations, available cash, available
    borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to access
    the capital markets and to refinance or renew our facilities in
    a timely manner will be adequate to meet our future cash needs.
    We cannot, however, make any assurances that in the future our
    business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or
    that borrowings or access to the capital markets or refinancing
    or renewal facilities will be available to us in amounts
    sufficient to enable us to pay or refinance our indebtedness or
    to fund other cash needs.

Indenture and Revolving Credit Facility
    Restrictions.

Our revolving credit facility and
    the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose
    restrictions on our operations and activities. The most
    significant restrictions relate to limits on investments, cash
    dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments,
    incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens and asset
    dispositions, and require maintenance of a maximum leverage
    ratio, a minimum ratio of earnings before interest, income
    taxes, depreciation and


amortization to interest incurred, minimum levels of tangible
    net worth and compliance with other financial covenants. In
    addition, the indentures governing our senior notes impose
    restrictions on the creation of liens. If we fail to comply with
    any of these restrictions or covenants, the trustees, the
    noteholders or the lending banks, as applicable, could cause our
    debt to become due and payable prior to maturity. If we do not
    maintain our current credit ratings, available credit under our
    revolving credit facility is subject to limitations based on
    specified percentages of unsold homes, developed lots and lots
    under development included in inventory and the amount of other
    senior unsecured indebtedness.

Change of Control Purchase Options.

If a
    change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing
    many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes,
    constituting $2,150.0 million principal amount in the
    aggregate as of September 30, 2006, we would be required to
    offer to purchase such notes at 101% of their principal amount,
    together with all accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moreover,
    a change of control may also result in the acceleration of our
    revolving credit facility and our financial services credit
    facilities. If purchase offers were required under the
    indentures for these notes or these credit facilities were
    accelerated, we can give no assurance that we would have
    sufficient funds to pay the amounts that we would be required to
    repurchase or repay. At September 30, 2006, we did not have
    sufficient funds available to purchase all of such outstanding
    debt upon a change of control.

Impact of Financial Services Debt.

Our
    financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries
    that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit
    facility. The ability of our financial services segment to
    provide funds to our homebuilding operations, however, is
    subject to restrictions in its own credit facilities. These
    funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and
    during the continuance of defaults under these facilities.
    Moreover, our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries
    upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the
    prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims
    we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to
    subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such
    indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as
    senior to our claims.

Homebuilding
    and financial services are very competitive, and competitive
    conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders
    compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable
    properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We
    compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders,
    including those with a sales presence on the Internet, often
    within larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed by
    such homebuilders. We also compete with existing home sales. The
    competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry can result
    in:

•

difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices;

•

increased selling incentives;

•

lower sales or profit margins;

•

delays in construction of our homes; or

•

impairments in the value of our inventory and goodwill.

Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks
    and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders with greater
    access to capital markets or different lending criteria may be
    able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers.

When we are affected by these competitive conditions, our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected.

Our
    future operations may require additional capital, which may not
    be available.

Our operations require significant amounts of cash, and our
    requirements for capital typically increase in the third and
    fourth quarters of our fiscal year. We may be required to seek
    additional capital, whether from sales of equity, debt issuances
    or additional bank borrowings, for the development and any
    future growth of


our business. We can give no assurance as to the availability of
    such additional capital or, if available, whether it would be on
    terms acceptable to us. Moreover, the indentures for our
    outstanding public debt and the covenants of our revolving
    credit facility contain provisions that may restrict the debt we
    may incur in the future. If we are not successful in obtaining
    sufficient capital, it could reduce our sales and may adversely
    affect our financial results.

We
    cannot make any assurances that our growth strategies will be
    successful.

Since 1993, we have acquired many homebuilding companies.
    Although we recently focused on internal growth, we may make
    strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future.
    Successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of
    operations and management and other efforts to realize the
    benefits that may be available. Although we believe that we have
    been successful in doing so in the past, we can give no
    assurance that we would be able to identify, acquire and
    integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders
    if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our
    liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash. In
    addition, acquisitions can expose us to the risk of writing off
    goodwill related to such acquisitions based on the subsequent
    results of the operating segments to which the acquired
    businesses were assigned. The risk of write-offs related to
    goodwill impairment increases during a cyclical housing downturn
    when profitability of our operating segments may decline.
    Moreover, we may not be able to implement successfully our
    operating and growth strategies within our existing markets.

Homebuilding
    is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in
    the ordinary course of business that can be
    significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and
    construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability
    insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from
    subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship
    and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for the
    homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and
    our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types
    of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these
    matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance
    coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will
    be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction
    defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be
    difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable
    self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
    covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits.
    Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of
    product liability insurance for construction defects are
    currently limited and costly. We have responded to increases in
    insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent years by
    increasing our self-insured retentions and claim reserves. There
    can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted
    or become more costly.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS

As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, the staff of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Staff) conducted a
    review of our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 and Quarterly
    Reports on

Form 10-Q

for the respective quarters ended December 31, 2005 and
    March 31, 2006 and issued a letter commenting on certain
    aspects of those reports. We believe that all matters addressed
    in the comment letter and our subsequent discussions with the
    SEC Staff have been resolved, except with regard to the
    reporting of our operating segments under
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.” As a result of the
    discussions, we have disaggregated the disclosure regarding our
    homebuilding operations from one reportable homebuilding segment
    to six separate reportable homebuilding segments. The
    disclosures within this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for all periods presented reflect this revised aggregation,
    which had no effect on our previously reported consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
    However, in the discussions, the SEC Staff also commented that
    similar disclosures should be made in our prior Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. We have not
    agreed to the SEC Staff’s comment because, among other
    reasons, the information in this year’s Annual Report on


Form 10-K

includes, in addition to fiscal 2006 segment information, prior
    year comparable revised segment information related to revenues,
    inventory impairments and income before income taxes for both
    fiscal 2005 and 2004, revised segment inventories as of
    September 30, 2005, and additional presentation and
    discussion of segment information in our Management Discussion
    and Analysis section for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
    prior year segment information has no effect on our previously
    reported consolidated financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows. Our discussions with the SEC Staff on this
    remaining matter have not been concluded.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own
    several office buildings totaling approximately
    246,000 square feet and we lease approximately
    1,609,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring
    through January 2015, in our various operating markets to house
    our homebuilding and financial services operating divisions, as
    well as our regional and corporate offices.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the
    ordinary course of business. Management believes that, while the
    ultimate outcome of the contingencies cannot be predicted with
    certainty, the ultimate liability, if any, will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position or operations.

As of December 4, 2006, the closing price of our common
    stock on the NYSE was $26.29, and there were approximately
    616 holders of record.

The declaration of cash dividends is at the discretion of our
    Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
    future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our general
    financial condition and general business conditions. We are
    required to comply with certain covenants contained in the bank
    agreements and our senior subordinated note indenture. The most
    restrictive of these requirements allows us to pay cash
    dividends on our common stock in an amount, on a cumulative
    basis, not to exceed 50% of consolidated net income, as defined,
    subject to certain other adjustments. Pursuant to the most
    restrictive of these requirements, at September 30, 2006,
    cash dividend payments in fiscal 2007 were limited to
    $583.5 million, and approximately $3.4 billion was
    available for all restricted payments in the future.

The information required by this item with respect to equity
    compensation plans is set forth under Item 12 of this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

and is incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, we did not sell any
    securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended.

In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock,
    replacing the previous common stock repurchase authorization.
    During fiscal 2006, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our
    common stock at a total cost of $36.8 million, all of which
    occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2005.
    As of September 30, 2006, we had $463.2 million
    remaining of the Board of Directors’ authorization for
    repurchases of common stock. In November 2006, our Board of
    Directors extended the remaining $463.2 million common
    stock repurchase authorization to November 30, 2007.

On January 26, 2006, our shareholders approved an amendment
    to the Company’s charter which increased the number of
    authorized shares of common stock to one billion shares.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations — Fiscal Year 2006 Overview

During fiscal 2006, the homebuilding industry experienced an
    industry-wide softening of demand for new homes. In many
    markets, home price appreciation over the past several years had
    attracted real estate investors and speculators. As price
    appreciation slowed in fiscal 2006, the demand from investors
    and speculators for new homes also slowed, resulting in an
    increase in new homes available for sale. At the same time,
    existing homes offered for sale by investors and speculators
    increased. In response to higher inventories of both new and
    existing homes, homebuilders increased the use of sales
    incentives to continue to sell new homes. In the third and
    fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, we experienced a decrease in our
    net sales orders due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer
    confidence and a related increase in sales contract
    cancellations, both of which we believe were caused by the
    continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by
    both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes. Our
    use of incentives also contributed to significantly lower gross
    margins on the homes we closed during those quarters. Although
    we believe the long-term fundamentals which support home sales
    demand remain solid and the current negative conditions in many
    of our markets will moderate over time, we cannot predict the
    duration and severity of the current market conditions.

During fiscal 2006, we adjusted our operating strategy to meet
    the new homebuilding business environment, and we expect to
    continue with these initiatives through fiscal 2007. These
    adjustments include:

•

Decreasing our SG&A infrastructure to be in line with our
    reduced expectations of production levels.

•

Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and
    subcontractors.

•

Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by
    significantly curtailing our spending for land and lot purchases
    and renegotiating or canceling land purchase contracts.

•

Reducing our inventory of homes under construction from current
    levels by limiting the construction of unsold homes.

•

Continuing to offer incentives to increase sales as necessary to
    maximize profits, returns and cash flows.

We expect that these adjustments to our operating strategy will
    generate positive cash flows in fiscal 2007 and allow us to
    maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position,
    providing us with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities
    as they become available in the future. Because we cannot
    predict the duration or severity of the current market
    conditions, we cannot provide any assurances that the
    adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address
    these conditions will be successful.

Key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006 were as follows:

Homebuilding
    Operations:

•

Homebuilding revenues increased by 8% in fiscal 2006. However,
    the value of net sales orders decreased by 5%, reflective of the
    more challenging market conditions recently encountered.

•

Homebuilding operating margins as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues decreased by 400 basis points during fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to lower homebuilding gross margins.

•

Our sales order backlog at September 30, 2006 was
    $5.2 billion, 11% below our backlog at September 30,
    2005.

•

Net homebuilding debt to total capital, which is calculated as
    homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital
    net of cash (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus
    stockholders’ equity), was 40.7% at September 30, 2006.


Financial
    Services Operations:

•

Total financial services revenues increased 24% in fiscal 2006,
    primarily due to a 41% increase in the number of loans sold
    during the year compared to fiscal 2005.

•

Financial services pre-tax income increased by 3% in fiscal
    2006, due to increased revenue from loan production and title
    closings, largely offset by the increase in financial services
    G&A costs.

Consolidated
    Results:

•

Net income decreased 16% in fiscal 2006, due to a 17% decrease
    in homebuilding operating margin.

•

Diluted earnings per share decreased 16% in fiscal 2006.

•

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 37.9%, as
    compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2005 and 38.4% in fiscal 2004.

Although specific directives within our operating strategy may
    have changed or may be implemented at a slower pace, our
    long-term operating strategy remains much the same. We intend to
    continue to take advantage of opportunities to grow our
    homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater
    market share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We plan
    to continue investing our available capital in our existing
    homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and
    entering satellite markets as opportunities are available. We
    will also continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition
    opportunities as they arise. To the extent that additional
    capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in
    our homebuilding operations or retain as liquidity, we will
    consider directing such capital toward alternative uses,
    including repayment of debt, dividend payments or stock
    repurchases, as market conditions or other circumstances may
    warrant, within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage
    targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and
    indentures.

Results
    of Operations — Homebuilding

Our seven homebuilding operating regions are our operating
    segments. We present six reportable segments, as we aggregate
    two of the operating regions into one reporting segment. These
    reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions,
    have homebuilding operations located in the following states:

Northeast:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only),
    Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico,
    Texas (Lubbock only) and Utah

California:

California and Nevada (Reno only)

West:

Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and
    Washington


Fiscal
    Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended
    September 30, 2005

The following tables set forth key operating and financial data
    for our homebuilding operations by reporting region as of and
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.
    Based on our revised aggregation of operating segments, we have
    restated fiscal 2005 amounts between regions to conform to the
    fiscal 2006 presentation.

    $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006 from
    $14,643.4 million (53,232 homes) in 2005. The number of net
    sales orders decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005, reflecting the industry-wide softening of demand for new
    homes in most homebuilding markets. We believe the most
    significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for
    new homes in most of our markets include an increase in the
    supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction in investor
    purchases, an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and
    sellers of existing homes and an increase in sales contract
    cancellation rates. Many prospective homebuyers are approaching
    the purchase decision more tentatively due to the increased
    uncertainty surrounding the housing market. These factors
    affected our business most significantly in our fourth fiscal
    quarter, when our net sales orders decreased 25% compared to the
    same quarter of fiscal 2005. Subsequent to fiscal year 2006, our
    net sales orders for the month ended October 31, 2006
    decreased 20% compared to the month ended October 31, 2005.

Our annual cancellation rate increased to 28% in fiscal 2006,
    and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006
    and the month ended October 31, 2006 increased to
    approximately 40%, exceeding our typical historical range of 16%
    to 20%. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2006 was
    primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our Arizona,
    California and Florida markets. A significant portion of the
    increase in cancellations was due to our prospective homebuyers
    being unable to sell their existing homes.

The largest percentage decreases in the number and value of net
    sales orders in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in
    our Northeast, Southeast and California regions. The decreases
    in sales in these regions are primarily attributable to the
    changes in market conditions described above. Partially
    offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18% increase
    in net sales orders in our South Central region, where many of
    our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand in
    fiscal 2006.

The average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was
    $267,300, a decrease of 3% from the $275,100 average in fiscal
    2005. During the year, slight to moderate increases and
    decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions,
    resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005.
    In general, our ability to raise prices is dependent on the
    demand for our homes; therefore, the lack of any significant
    overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to
    the recent decrease in demand and our increased use of sales
    incentives in many markets. Particularly, the home price
    appreciation that occurred in many of our California, Arizona
    and Florida markets during fiscal 2005 has since moderated and
    in many instances has reversed. We also continually monitor and
    may adjust our product and geographic mix and pricing within our
    homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product
    offerings affordable for our target customer base, typically
    first-time and

move-up

homebuyers. This sometimes also contributes to a decrease in the
    average price.


Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet
    closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our
    sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including
    mortgage loan approval, which can result in cancellations. In
    the past, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level
    of closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters, although this
    relationship may change if our cancellation rates remain above
    normal levels or continue to increase. Historically, our backlog
    conversion rates (closings during the quarter divided by
    beginning of the quarter backlog), have generally been in the
    range of 50% to 75%, with the highest quarterly conversion rate
    of each fiscal year typically occurring in the fourth quarter.

At September 30, 2006, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes), down 11% from
    $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes) at September 30, 2005.
    The average sales price of homes in backlog was $286,100 at
    September 30, 2006, down 6% from the $303,200 average at
    September 30, 2005. The value of our sales order backlog
    decreased in four of our six market regions, led by decreases of
    31%, 30% and 26% in our Northeast, Southeast and California
    regions, respectively, which is reflective of the current
    difficult sales environment. The average selling price of homes
    in backlog at September 30, 2006 as compared to
    September 30, 2005 reflect only slight to moderate
    increases and decreases among our regions.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales increased 9%, to $14,545.4 million
    (53,099 homes closed) in 2006 from $13,376.6 million
    (51,172 homes closed) in 2005. Revenues from home sales
    increased in all six of our market regions, led by the Northeast
    and Southeast regions, with increases of 22% and 13%,
    respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during
    2006 was $273,900, up 5% from $261,400 in 2005. The average
    selling price of homes closed increased by slight to moderate
    amounts in five of our six market regions, led by the Southwest
    and Southeast regions with increases of 12% and 11%,
    respectively. Many markets, especially some of the California,
    Arizona and Florida markets which experienced the most price
    appreciation in recent years, have experienced weakening demand
    in the latter part of fiscal 2006, resulting in declines in
    total and per home revenue. As reflected in our net sales order
    volume, demand has slowed in a number of our markets in recent
    quarters, and in general, we are offering more incentives and
    price concessions to obtain home sales.

Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by
    $1.6 million, while revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005
    were reduced by $92.2 million from changes in profit
    deferred pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real
    Estate.” The home sales profit related to our mortgage
    loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer
    finances a home through our wholly-owned mortgage company and
    has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as
    prescribed by SFAS No. 66. As of September 30,
    2006, the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage
    loans held for sale was $90.6 million.

Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4%, to
    $3,342.2 million in 2006 from $3,488.3 million in
    2005. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total
    homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues decreased 300 basis points, to 22.6% in 2006 from
    25.6% in 2005.

Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales
    revenues decreased 150 basis points, to 24.0% in 2006 from
    25.5% in 2005. The primary factors reducing our home sales gross
    profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed
    above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and
    costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline
    of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross
    margin. We have had to utilize additional incentives in many of
    our markets due to the current challenging sales environment.
    Sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the
    selling price of the home, or by increasing the cost of the home
    without a proportional increase in the selling price. An
    additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin decline
    was a result of the decrease in the relative number of closings
    in markets such as California and Nevada, which have had
    significant price appreciation in the last few years and,
    therefore, have had above average gross margins. These declines
    were partially offset by an improvement of approximately
    55 basis points related to the increase in home sales
    revenues and gross profit from the recognition of profit
    previously deferred in accordance with SFAS No. 66.
    The remaining improvement of 40 basis points was primarily due
    to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses as a
    percentage of home sales revenues.


In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” land
    inventory and related communities under development are reviewed
    for potential write-downs when impairment indicators are
    present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is
    less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows
    are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs, and
    other factors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination
    of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated
    cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks
    associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow
    streams. Valuation adjustments on finished homes are recorded
    when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value is
    less than the fair value less costs to sell the home.

During fiscal 2006, several communities under development that
    demonstrated potential impairment indicators, with a combined
    carrying value of $739.5 million at September 30, 2006, were
    evaluated for potential impairment. Our analyses of these
    projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared
    with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues
    realized from comparable projects. We determined that projects
    with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which
    were in California, were impaired. Consequently, we recorded
    impairment charges of $146.2 million to reduce the carrying
    value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value.
    The remaining $280.2 million of such projects with
    impairment indicators are primarily in California. It is
    possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these
    projects may change and could result in a future need to record
    impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value.
    Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen
    in the future, we may be required to evaluate additional
    projects for potential impairment which may result in additional
    impairment charges and such charges could be significant.

We periodically write off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts
    which we no longer plan to pursue. During fiscal 2006 and 2005,
    we wrote off $124.7 million and $17.1 million,
    respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to land purchase option contracts which we
    determined we would not pursue. The inventory impairment charges
    and write-offs of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues by approximately 180 basis points in
    fiscal 2006. Should the current weak homebuilding market
    conditions persist and if we are unable to successfully
    renegotiate certain land purchase contracts, we may have to
    write off additional earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs. We currently do not expect the potential for such
    write-offs in fiscal 2007 to be as significant as the fiscal
    2006 write-offs.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by
    $230.0 million, or 19%, to $1,456.6 million in 2006
    from $1,226.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenues,
    SG&A expenses increased 90 basis points, to 9.9% in
    2006 from 9.0% in 2005. The largest component of our
    homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 64% and 67% of SG&A costs in 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased
    $115.1 million, or 14%, to $932.4 million in 2006 from
    $817.3 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of
    employees to support our previously planned growth. The
    remaining increase in SG&A of $114.9 million was
    primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs,
    property taxes, rent expense and subdivision maintenance. These
    increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the
    competitive selling environment.

Throughout fiscal 2005 and through the first half of fiscal
    2006, we increased the infrastructure of our homebuilding
    operations to support the then planned delivery of approximately
    58,000 homes in fiscal 2006 and further growth in home closings
    into fiscal 2007. However, due to recent sales trends, the
    increase in home closings of only 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to
    17% in fiscal 2005 and an actual decline in home closings in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period of
    fiscal 2005, we no longer expect further growth in home closings
    in the near term. We are adjusting our SG&A infrastructure
    to support our


decreased expectations of future closing volumes; however, we
    cannot provide assurance that future SG&A expense levels as
    a percentage of homebuilding revenues will be as low as
    historical levels.

Interest
    Expense

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under
    construction or development. During both fiscal 2005 and 2006,
    our inventory under construction or development exceeded our
    interest-bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized virtually all
    interest from homebuilding debt except for the call premium,
    unamortized discount/premium and fees related to debt we paid
    off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales was
    2.1% of total cost of sales in 2006, compared to 2.2% in 2005.
    In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early redemption of our
    9.375% senior notes due 2011 and our 10.5% senior
    subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded interest expense of
    approximately $13.4 million for the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and issuance costs, net of any unamortized
    premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded
    interest expense of approximately $4.4 million related to
    the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and
    replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. In
    fiscal 2005, in connection with the early redemption of our
    9.375% senior notes due 2009, we recorded interest expense
    of approximately $4.4 million for the call premium and
    unamortized issuance costs, net of the unamortized premium
    related to these redeemed notes.

Excluding interest charges related to early retirement of debt
    and the replacement of our revolving credit facility, interest
    incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 19%, to
    $325.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to
    $272.9 million in fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from
    an increase in our average homebuilding debt of 34% in 2006
    compared to 2005. Interest incurred increased at a slower rate
    than our debt primarily because our debt has been more heavily
    weighted to our revolving credit facility in 2006. The revolving
    credit facility carries a lower interest rate than the weighted
    average interest rate of our senior and senior subordinated
    notes. Our ongoing efforts to replace our older, higher interest
    rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also
    contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $11.0 million in 2006, compared
    to $15.7 million in 2005. The major component of other
    income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value
    of our interest rate swaps of $3.1 million and
    $9.5 million, respectively. Also included in other income
    in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of $6.9 million and
    $3.9 million, respectively.

Goodwill

At September 30, 2006, we had $578.9 million in
    goodwill, which we evaluate for impairment annually or when
    circumstances warrant an earlier review. We have allocated our
    goodwill to our reporting regions as follows, as of
    September 30, 2006 and 2005: Northeast $74.4 million,
    Southeast $11.5 million, South Central $15.9 million,
    Southwest $102.4 million, California $300.3 million
    and West $74.4 million. Although no impairment existed as
    of September 30, 2006, if market conditions continue to
    deteriorate in our reporting regions, our impairment review may
    result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.

Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

Northeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 22% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 16%
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between
    the two years; however, as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, it decreased 220 basis points to 9.0%, from 11.2%
    in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the
    region’s core home sales gross profit percentage (home
    sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs), with the gross
    margin declines in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets
    having the greatest impact on the overall decrease.
    Additionally, profitability was negatively affected by the
    recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost
    write-offs of $38.5 million in fiscal 2006 versus
    $1.3 million in fiscal 2005.


Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 12% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an 11%
    increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well
    as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income
    before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between
    the two years; however, as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, it decreased 250 basis points to 17.0%, from 19.5% in
    2005. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the
    region’s gross profit percentage, which was negatively
    affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and
    land option cost write-offs of $34.4 million in fiscal 2006
    versus $3.8 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding these
    charges, we experienced similar core home sales gross profit
    margins in both fiscal years; however, we did experience a sharp
    decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006,
    reflecting the softening market conditions, especially in
    Florida.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 9% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was 26% higher in 2006
    compared to 2005, and as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, increased 100 basis points to 7.4%, from 6.4% in
    2005. This increase in income before income taxes was primarily
    due to a decrease in the region’s selling, general and
    administrative costs as a percentage of revenues, as gross
    margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal
    2006.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 10% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to a 12% increase in
    the average selling price of homes closed, while the number of
    homes closed decreased 3%. Income before income taxes for the
    region was 10% higher in 2006 compared to 2005, and as a
    percentage of the region’s revenues was 15.2% in both
    years. Inventory impairment charges and land option cost
    write-offs of $25.7 million in fiscal 2006 versus
    $1.3 million in fiscal 2005 contributed to an 80 basis
    point decline in the region’s gross margin. This decline
    was offset by a $22.8 million increase in gross margin
    resulting from changes in profit deferred pursuant to
    SFAS No. 66. While core homebuilding margins were
    relatively flat in the Denver and Phoenix markets for the full
    fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005, we did
    experience a sharp decline in the Phoenix market home sales
    gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared
    with the earlier quarters.

California Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    remained relatively flat, increasing only 1% in 2006 compared to
    2005, reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed
    and a slight decline in the average selling price of those
    homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 54% lower
    in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the
    region’s revenues, decreased 1,120 basis points to 9.5%,
    from 20.7% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the
    region’s gross profit percentage, which was significantly
    affected by a decline of approximately 600 basis points in
    the region’s core home sales gross margins with the largest
    declines in the Sacramento and San Diego markets. In
    addition, the recording of inventory impairment charges and
    earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs of
    $165.8 million in fiscal 2006 versus $9.2 in fiscal 2005
    had a significant negative impact on gross margins.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues remained
    relatively flat, increasing only 2% in 2006 compared to 2005,
    due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and
    in the average selling price of those homes. Income before
    income taxes for the region was 13% lower in 2006 compared to
    2005 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues,
    decreased 390 basis points to 22.9%, from 26.8% in 2005.
    This decrease was due to a decrease in the region’s gross
    profit percentage, primarily attributable to lower gross margins
    in the Las Vegas market.

Net
    Sales Orders and Backlog

The value of net sales orders increased 28%, to
    $14,643.4 million (53,232 homes) in 2005 from
    $11,406.2 million (45,263 homes) in 2004. The overall
    cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2005
    and 2004 were 19% and 17%, respectively. The average price of a
    net sales order in 2005 was $275,100, up 9% from the $252,000
    average in 2004. The number and value of net sales orders
    increased in all six of our market regions, reflecting the
    execution of our organic growth strategies and the overall
    strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2005.

All regions produced double-digit percentage increases in the
    value of net sales orders during fiscal 2005, led by our
    Southeast and Southwest regions, with increases of 46% and 40%,
    respectively. The increase in our Southeast region resulted from
    the continued expansion of our presence in our Florida markets
    where housing demand was high. The increase in our Southwest
    region was primarily due to increases in homes sold and average
    sales price in our Arizona and New Mexico markets. The average
    price of net sales orders increased at varying levels across all
    of our regions, reflecting our ability to increase prices in
    markets where demand for our homes was strongest. The highest
    percentage increases in average sales prices occurred in our
    Southwest, Southeast and California regions, while lesser
    increases were experienced in our West, South Central and
    Northeast regions. In the Northeast region where demand was
    still strong, our efforts to offer more lower-priced products,
    particularly in the Chicago market, resulted in an increase of
    only 1% in the average sales price.

At September 30, 2005, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes), up 28% from
    $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes) at September 30, 2004.
    The average sales price of homes in backlog was $303,200 at
    September 30, 2005, up 14% from the $265,900 average at
    September 30, 2004. The value of our sales order backlog
    increased in four of our six market regions, led by increases of
    50% in both our Northeast and Southwest regions. The average
    selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market
    regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in our
    Southeast and Southwest regions, where generally strong demand
    for our homes allowed us to increase prices.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales increased 28%, to
    $13,376.6 million (51,172 homes closed) in 2005 from
    $10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004. Revenues
    from home sales increased by 20% or more in four of our six
    market regions and the number of homes closed increased by more
    than 10% in five of our six market regions. These results
    reflect the execution of our growth strategies, continued
    strength in demand for new homes and our homebuilding
    divisions’ ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog
    to homebuyers. The average selling price of homes closed during
    2005 was $261,400, up 9% from $240,800 in 2004. The average
    selling price of homes closed increased by more than 10% in four
    of our six market regions.


Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by a
    $92.2 million deferral of profit at September 30,
    2005, pursuant to SFAS No. 66.

Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 42%, to
    $3,488.3 million in 2005 from $2,460.7 million in
    2004. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total
    homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues increased 250 basis points, to 25.6% in 2005 from
    23.1% in 2004. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of
    home sales revenues increased 250 basis points, to 25.5% in 2005
    from 23.0% in 2004. Of the 250 basis point improvement in
    home sales gross profit percentage, approximately 170 basis
    points was due to market conditions that led to strong demand
    for our homes. Those conditions allowed us to raise the selling
    prices of our homes more rapidly than the overall increases in
    the construction costs of our homes in the majority of our
    markets. Our largest selling price and gross profit increases
    were obtained in our Florida and Arizona markets. An additional
    70 basis points of the improvement in home sales gross profit
    percentage was due to a decrease in the capitalized interest
    amortized to cost of sales as a percentage of home sales
    revenues, which was attributable to our homebuilding leverage
    ratio improvement and our debt refinancing efforts over the past
    two years. The remaining home sales gross profit percentage
    improvement related primarily to the relative increase in
    closings in our more profitable markets due to our efforts to
    re-allocate capital to these markets.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expense

SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by
    $267.6 million, or 28%, to $1,226.6 million in 2005
    from $959.0 million in 2004. As a percentage of revenues,
    SG&A expenses were 9.0% in both years. The largest component
    of our homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and
    related costs, which represented 67% and 65% of SG&A costs
    in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Those costs increased
    $192.4 million, or 31%, to $817.3 million in 2005 from
    $624.9 million in 2004, largely due to the addition of
    employees to support our growth. The remaining increase in
    SG&A of $75.2 million was primarily attributable to
    increases in advertising costs, rent expense, subdivision
    maintenance and model home furniture depreciation.

Interest
    Expense

Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 17%,
    to $277.3 million in 2005 from $236.7 million in 2004,
    while our average daily homebuilding debt increased 26% in 2005
    from 2004. The percentage increase in our average homebuilding
    debt was higher than the percentage increase in our interest
    incurred due to the March 2004 restructuring of our unsecured
    revolving credit facility which resulted in lower borrowing
    costs throughout 2005, and due to our efforts over the past two
    fiscal years to replace some of our higher interest rate notes
    with notes bearing lower interest rates.

We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under
    construction or development. During both fiscal years, our
    inventory under construction or development exceeded our
    interest-bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest
    from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts,
    premiums and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity.
    Interest amortized to cost of sales decreased by 10%, to
    $225.0 million in 2005 from $249.0 million in 2004.
    This reduction in interest amortized to total cost of sales is a
    direct result of the reductions in our homebuilding leverage and
    our debt refinancing efforts over the last two years.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $15.7 million in 2005, compared
    to $9.9 million in 2004. The major component of other
    income in both 2005 and 2004 was the increase in the fair value
    of our interest rate swaps of $9.5 million and
    $8.1 million, respectively. Also included in other income
    in 2005 and 2004 was interest income of $3.9 million and
    $2.2 million, respectively.


Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

Northeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 19% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to an
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was 29% higher in 2005
    compared to 2004, and as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, increased 90 basis points to 11.2%, from 10.3% in
    2004. This increase was due to an increase in the region’s
    home sales gross profit percentage, with the gross margin
    improvements in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets having
    the greatest impact on the overall increase.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 71% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 54%
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a 12%
    increase in the average selling price of those homes, reflecting
    an increase in housing demand and our increased investments in
    the region, particularly in Florida. Income before income taxes
    for the region was 135% higher in 2005 compared to 2004, and as
    a percentage of the region’s revenues, increased
    530 basis points to 19.5%, from 14.2% in 2004. This
    increase was primarily due to an increase in the region’s
    home sales gross profit percentage, particularly in our Florida
    markets, where the high demand for homes enabled us to both
    aggressively increase prices and close more homes.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 16% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 14%
    increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was 16% higher in 2005
    compared to 2004; however, as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues, it decreased 10 basis points to 6.4%, from 6.5%
    in 2004. The increase in income before income taxes was
    primarily due to the increase in the number of homes closed,
    while the slight decrease in income before taxes as a percentage
    of the region’s revenues was the result of home sales gross
    profit percentages decreasing slightly in 2005 compared to 2004.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 25% in 2005 compared to 2004, due to an 11% increase
    in the number of homes closed and a 13% increase in the average
    selling price of those homes, reflecting an increase in housing
    demand, particularly in Arizona. Income before income taxes for
    the region was 98% higher in 2005 compared to 2004, and as a
    percentage of the region’s revenues, increased
    560 basis points to 15.2%, from 9.6% in 2004. This increase
    was primarily due to an increase in the region’s home sales
    gross profit percentage, particularly in our Arizona and New
    Mexico markets, where the high demand for homes enabled us to
    more aggressively increase prices.

California Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    increased 19% in 2005 compared to 2004, due to a 9% increase in
    the number of homes closed and an 11% increase in the average
    selling price of those homes, reflecting continued strong
    housing demand in California in 2005. Income before income taxes
    for the region was 17% higher in 2005 compared to 2004; however,
    as a percentage of the region’s revenues, it decreased
    30 basis points to 20.7%, from 21.0% in 2004 largely due to
    an increase in SG&A as a percentage of the region’s
    revenues.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues increased
    49% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 25% increase in
    the number of homes closed, as well as a 13% increase in the
    average selling price of those homes, reflecting the strong
    housing demand throughout the region in 2005 and our increased
    investments in the region, particularly in Nevada. Income before
    income taxes for the region was 77% higher in 2005 compared to
    2004 and as a percentage of the region’s revenues,
    increased 430 basis points to 26.8%, from 22.5% in 2004.
    This increase was primarily due to an increase in the
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage, particularly
    in our Hawaii and Oregon markets, where we experienced
    significant price appreciation during fiscal 2005.

The volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage
    operations is directly related to the number and value of homes
    closed by our homebuilding operations. Total first-lien loans
    originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers
    increased 11% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The
    increase in loans originated or brokered was greater than our 4%
    increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage
    capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our
    homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the
    homebuyers’ financing) increased to 68% in 2006 from 63% in
    2005. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted
    94% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2006, compared to


93% in 2005, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations.

The number of loans sold to third-party investors increased 41%
    in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to
    the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated, as well
    as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes
    during fiscal 2006. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2006
    includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of
    mortgage loans held at September 30, 2005.

Revenues from the financial services segment increased 24%, to
    $290.8 million in 2006 from $235.1 million in 2005.
    The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to
    the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and
    sold, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average
    mortgage revenues earned per loan sold. The decline in revenue
    per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions
    for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in
    fiscal 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the revenues
    associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors.

General and administrative (G&A) expenses associated with
    financial services increased 37%, to $202.2 million in 2006
    from $147.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of financial
    services revenues, G&A expenses increased by 670 basis
    points, to 69.5% in 2006 from 62.8% in 2005. The largest
    component of our financial services G&A expense is employee
    compensation and related costs, which represented 77% and 76% of
    G&A costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those costs
    increased 39%, to $155.4 million in 2006 from
    $111.6 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of
    employees to support our previously planned growth. The increase
    in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    financial services revenues reflects the growth of our financial
    services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in
    revenues. Because we now do not expect our year over year growth
    in home closings and the related mortgage loan originations to
    continue, we have adjusted, and will continue to adjust, our
    financial services G&A infrastructure to support our
    expected closings volume. Significant fluctuations in financial
    services general and administrative expense as a percentage of
    revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount
    of revenue earned. In addition, our financial services
    operations are generally staffed at levels sufficient to support
    our anticipated seasonal higher mortgage loan volume periods,
    which may vary significantly between periods.

Total first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage
    for our homebuyers increased 23% in fiscal 2005 compared to
    fiscal 2004, which was greater than our 17% increase in the
    number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate (the
    percentage of total home closings from our homebuilding
    operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers’
    financing) increased to 63% in 2005 from 61% in 2004. Home
    closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 93% of DHI
    Mortgage loan originations in 2005, compared to 92% in 2004,
    reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on supporting the
    captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. Sales
    of loans to third-party investors increased 28% in 2005 as
    compared to 2004.

Revenues from the financial services segment increased 29%, to
    $235.1 million in 2005 from $182.8 million in 2004.
    The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to
    the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and
    sold, while the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold
    remained relatively constant. The majority of the revenues
    associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors.

G&A expenses associated with financial services increased
    22%, to $147.6 million in 2005 from $121.0 million in
    2004. As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A
    expenses decreased by 340 basis points, to 62.8% in 2005
    from 66.2% in 2004. The largest component of our financial
    services G&A expense is employee compensation and related
    costs, which represented 76% and 73% of G&A costs in 2005
    and 2004, respectively. Those costs increased 26%, to
    $111.6 million in 2005 from $88.8 million in 2004,
    largely due to the addition of employees to support our growth.
    The improvement in general and administrative expenses as a
    percentage of financial services revenues was due primarily to
    the more efficient use of our personnel to support the increase
    in mortgage loan volume. Significant fluctuations in financial
    services general and administrative expense as a percentage of
    revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount
    of revenue earned.


Overview
    of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity

We fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with
    cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank
    credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. As we
    utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our
    operations, we have focused on maintaining a strong balance
    sheet.

At September 30, 2006, our ratio of net homebuilding debt
    to total capital was 40.7%, an increase of 850 basis points
    from 32.2% at September 30, 2005. Net homebuilding debt to
    total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash
    divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable
    net of cash plus stockholders’ equity). Homebuilding notes
    payable does not include the balance of liabilities, if any,
    associated with consolidated land inventory not owned. The
    increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital
    at September 30, 2006 as compared with the ratio a year
    earlier was due to the decrease in cash and the increase in
    borrowings associated with funding our increase in inventory,
    partially offset by the increase in retained earnings. Our
    target operating range for net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is below 45%, so the 40.7% ratio at September 30,
    2006 is in line with our operating target. We remain focused on
    maintaining our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so
    we can be flexible in reacting to market conditions; however,
    future fiscal year-end net homebuilding debt to total capital
    ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2006 year-end ratio.

We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our
    homebuilding operations and comparing us with other
    homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services
    business because the business is separately capitalized and its
    debt is substantially collateralized by specified mortgage loans
    held for sale, and its debt is not guaranteed by our parent
    company or any of our homebuilding entities. Because of its
    capital function, we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of
    our homebuilding debt and total capital. For comparison, at
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, our ratios of homebuilding
    debt to total capital, without netting cash balances, were 43.1%
    and 40.6%, respectively.

We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our
    homebuilding and financial services operations and our future
    cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of
    our existing cash resources, cash flows from operations, our
    existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new
    debt securities through the public capital markets.

Homebuilding
    Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2006, our available homebuilding cash and
    cash equivalents amounted to $457.8 million.

Bank Credit Facility

— During November 2006, we
    increased the size of our $2.15 billion unsecured revolving
    credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of
    credit

sub-facility,

to $2.5 billion and extended its maturity by one year to
    December 16, 2011. The revolving credit facility has an
    uncommitted $400 million accordion provision which could be
    used to increase the facility to $2.9 billion. The facility
    is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. We
    borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout
    the year to fund working capital requirements, and we repay such
    borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the
    issuance of public debt securities.

We had $800.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our
    homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30,
    2006 and no outstanding borrowings on the facility at
    September 30, 2005. Under the debt covenants associated
    with our revolving credit facility, when we have fewer than two
    investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from Moody’s
    Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s
    Corporation, our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity
    under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused
    portion of the facility, $1.23 billion at
    September 30, 2006, or an amount determined under a
    borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation,
    the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving
    credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the
    various categories of our unencumbered inventory. Beginning
    November 7, 2005, we had the two required investment grade
    debt ratings, so the


borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect. On
    April 5, 2006, we received the investment grade rating from
    the third rating agency.

Our revolving credit facility also imposes restrictions on our
    operations and activities, including limits on investments, cash
    dividends, stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness, and
    required maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum
    ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
    amortization and extraordinary gains and losses to interest
    incurred and minimum levels of tangible net worth. At
    September 30, 2006, we were in compliance with all of the
    covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our
    bank revolving credit facility and our public debt obligations.

Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt

— On
    March 15, 2006, we redeemed our 9.375% senior notes
    due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately
    $209.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the
    redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately
    $10.6 million, representing the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes.

On July 15, 2006, we redeemed our 10.5% senior
    subordinated notes due 2011. The notes, which were originally
    issued by Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed in the merger in
    February 2002, were redeemed at an aggregate price of
    approximately $152.4 million, plus accrued interest.
    Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of
    approximately $2.8 million, representing the call premium,
    net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes.

Recently Issued Public Unsecured Debt

— In
    April 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.5% senior
    notes due 2016 and $250 million of 6.0% senior notes
    due 2011. We used the proceeds from these offerings for the
    repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Shelf Registration Statements

— On
    June 13, 2006, we filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission an automatically effective universal shelf
    registration statement registering debt and equity securities
    which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be
    determined. Also, at September 30, 2006, we had the
    capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of
    common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement,
    to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business
    acquisitions.

Financial
    Services Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2006, we had available financial services
    cash and cash equivalents of $129.8 million.

Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility

— Our
    wholly-owned mortgage company has a mortgage warehouse loan
    facility. Upon its maturity in April 2006, the loan agreement
    was amended and restated to extend its maturity date to
    April 6, 2007. This amendment also changed the total
    capacity of the mortgage warehouse loan facility from
    $600 million to $670 million until May 1, 2006
    and then to $540 million thereafter, subject to increases
    upon consent of the lenders to $750 million under the
    accordion provision of the credit agreement. Through exercise of
    the accordion provision in September 2006, the total capacity of
    the mortgage warehouse loan facility was increased to
    $750 million from September 22, 2006 to
    November 6, 2006 and then to $540 million thereafter.
    At September 30, 2006, we had borrowings of
    $371.7 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse
    facility.

Our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the
    lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount
    determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the
    borrowing base limitation, the amount drawn on our mortgage
    warehouse facility may not exceed 98% of all eligible mortgage
    loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure
    any borrowings under the facility.

Commercial Paper Conduit Facility

— Our
    wholly-owned mortgage company also has a commercial paper
    conduit facility (the “CP conduit facility”). Upon its
    maturity in June 2006, the loan agreement was amended and
    restated, increasing the total capacity of the CP conduit
    facility from $650 million to $1.2 billion. The new
    agreement expires June 27, 2009, subject to the annual
    renewal of the

364-day

backup liquidity feature. At September 30, 2006, we had
    borrowings of $820.0 million outstanding under the CP
    conduit facility.


In the past, we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage
    warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility on
    satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain
    temporary additional commitments through amendments of the
    respective credit agreements during periods of higher than
    normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. Although we do not
    anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these
    facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the
    future, the liquidity of our financial services business depends
    upon our continued ability to do so.

The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility
    are not guaranteed by either D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the
    subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. Borrowings
    under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held
    for sale. Additionally, at September 30, 2006, borrowings
    under the CP conduit facility were secured by restricted cash
    arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the
    assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral. The
    mortgage loans assigned to secure the CP conduit facility are
    used as collateral for asset-backed commercial paper issued by
    multi-seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At
    September 30, 2006, our total mortgage loans held for sale
    were $1,022.9 million. All mortgage company activities are
    financed with the mortgage warehouse facility, the CP conduit
    facility or internally generated funds. Both of our financial
    services credit facilities contain financial covenants as to our
    mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net worth,
    its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and
    its minimum required net income. At September 30, 2006, our
    mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of these
    covenants.

Operating
    Cash Flow Activities

During the year ended September 30, 2006, we used
    $1.2 billion of cash in our operating activities, as
    compared to $620.7 million of cash used in such activities
    during the prior year. The net cash used in operations during
    fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of cash provided from net
    income and a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale, offset by
    cash used to increase residential land and lot and home
    inventories. The net cash used in operations during fiscal 2005
    was the result of cash provided from net income and an increase
    in accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by cash used
    to increase residential land, lot and home inventories, mortgage
    loans held for sale and other assets.

The principal reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in
    fiscal 2006 was our decision to invest $3.1 billion of cash
    to fund inventory growth in the period as compared to a
    $1.9 billion cash investment for inventory growth in fiscal
    2005. The decision to fund additional inventory growth was based
    on management’s expectations for future returns from the
    incremental inventory investments. In light of the more
    challenging market conditions encountered in the last six months
    of fiscal 2006, our expectations have changed, so we have
    substantially slowed our planned purchases of land and lots to
    reduce our inventory to better match our new reduced rate of
    production. Our ability to reduce our inventory levels in the
    near term is, however, partially dependent upon our ability to
    close a sufficient number of homes in the next few quarters. To
    the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2007, we
    expect net positive cash flows from operating activities in
    fiscal 2007, assuming all other factors remain constant.

A large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents
    purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate
    revenues and cash flows in future years. Since we control the
    amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on
    our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities, we
    believe that cash flows from operating activities before
    increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a
    better indicator of our cash flows from operations.

Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in
    fiscal 2006 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of
    $335.8 million during fiscal 2006. The decrease in mortgage
    loans held for sale was due to an increase in the volume of
    loans sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, as a result of more efficient
    loan sale processes put in place during fiscal 2006. We expect
    to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans
    held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow.
    However, in periods when home closings are flat or decline as
    compared to prior periods or if our mortgage capture rate
    declines, the amount of net cash used may be reduced or we may
    generate positive cash flows from the reduction in the balance
    of mortgage loans held for sale.


Investing
    Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2006 and 2005, cash used in investing activities
    represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily
    model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are
    not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, and
    they typically do not vary significantly from year to year.

Financing
    Cash Flow Activities

The majority of our short-term financing needs are funded with
    cash generated from operations and borrowings available under
    our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities.
    Long-term financing needs are generally funded with the issuance
    of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public
    capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated
    notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries.

In March 2006, we redeemed our 9.375% senior subordinated
    notes due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately
    $209.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the
    redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately
    $10.6 million, representing the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes.

In April 2006, we issued $500 million principal amount of
    6.5% senior notes due 2016 and $250 million principal
    amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2011. We used the proceeds
    from these offerings for the repayment of borrowings under the
    revolving credit facility.

In July 2006, we redeemed our 10.5% senior subordinated
    notes due 2011. The notes, which were originally issued by
    Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed in the merger in February
    2002, were redeemed at an aggregate price of approximately
    $152.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the
    redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately
    $2.8 million, representing the call premium, net of the
    unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes.

Borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the CP conduit
    facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held
    for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the
    facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as
    collateral. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the balances of
    cash restricted for this purpose were $248.3 million and
    $0, respectively.

During fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors declared one
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share, two
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share, and one
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, the last
    of which was paid on September 1, 2006 to stockholders of
    record on August 21, 2006. On October 12, 2006, our
    Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per
    common share, which was paid on November 1, 2006, to
    stockholders of record on October 23, 2006.

Changes
    in Capital Structure

In December 2003, our Board of Directors declared a

three-for-two

stock split (effected as a 50% stock dividend), paid on
    January 12, 2004 to holders of record of our common stock
    as of December 22, 2003. In February 2005, our Board of
    Directors declared a

four-for-three

stock split (effected as a


/


%
    stock dividend), paid on March 16, 2005 to holders of
    record of our common stock as of March 1, 2005.

In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock and up
    to $200 million of outstanding debt securities, replacing
    the previous common stock and debt securities repurchase
    authorizations. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased one million
    shares of our common stock at a total cost of
    $36.8 million, all of which occurred during the three
    months ended December 31, 2005. As of September 30,
    2006, we had $463.2 million remaining of the Board of
    Directors’ authorization for repurchases of common stock
    and $200 million remaining of the authorization for
    repurchases of debt securities. In November 2006, our Board of
    Directors renewed the remaining $463.2 million common stock
    repurchase authorization and increased the debt repurchase
    authorization to $500 million. Additionally, both
    authorizations were extended to November 30, 2007.


On January 26, 2006, our shareholders approved an amendment
    to the D.R. Horton, Inc. charter which increased the number of
    authorized shares of common stock to one billion shares.

We continue to evaluate our alternatives for future

non-operating

uses of our available capital, including repayment of debt,
    dividend payments and common stock repurchases, based on market
    conditions and other circumstances, and within the constraints
    of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions gin
    our bank agreements and indentures.

Contractual
    Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding
    and financial services segments are payments under short-term
    and long-term debt agreements and lease payments under operating
    leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment
    represent specific performance requirements under lot option
    purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land
    contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We
    expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary
    course of business through our operating cash flows, our
    homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by
    accessing the debt capital markets.

Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of
    September 30, 2006 are presented below:

Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest
    payments due on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes,
    our revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The
    principal amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to
    be $800 million through its maturity, and the related
    interest obligation is based on the effective rate of 6.1% as of
    September 30, 2006.

(2)

Financial services notes payable represent principal and
    interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary’s
    warehouse loan facility and commercial paper conduit facility.
    The interest obligations associated with these variable rate
    facilities are based on their effective rates of 6.1% and 5.6%,
    respectively, and principal balances outstanding at
    September 30, 2006.

At September 30, 2006, our homebuilding operations had
    outstanding letters of credit of $128.2 million and surety
    bonds of $2.3 billion, issued by third parties, to secure
    performance under various contracts. We expect that our
    performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and
    bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of
    business and in accordance with the applicable contractual
    terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related
    letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly
    thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have
    no material third-party guarantees.

To meet the financing needs of our customers, our mortgage
    operations extend interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) to
    borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined
    credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a
    duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed
    immediately to a specific investor through the use of
    best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs
    are funded prior to being committed to third-party investors.


We manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted IRLCs
    through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
    (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC)
    on certain loan types. As of September 30, 2006, our IRLCs
    totaled $647.7 million, and we had approximately
    $391.6 million of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments and $429.5 million outstanding of FMBS and EDFC
    related to our uncommitted IRLCs.

In an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering
    homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing,
    we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from
    future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage
    originations of approximately $599 million. To accomplish
    this, we purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic
    interest rate hedges in the form of FMBS and put options on both
    EDFC and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). At September 30,
    2006, the notional amount of the FRAs was $354 million,
    while economic interest rate hedges totaled $2.4 billion in
    EDFC put options and $104 million in MBS put options,
    hedging a notional principal of $245.0 million in mortgage
    loan commitments. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate
    hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months.
    These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and
    are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized
    in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 were not significant.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot
    option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the
    construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control
    significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and
    substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership
    and development. At September 30, 2006, we owned or
    controlled approximately 323,000 lots, 41% of which were lots
    under option or similar contracts, compared with approximately
    346,000 lots at September 30, 2005.

At September 30, 2006, we controlled approximately 133,000
    lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately
    $4.0 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts,
    with a total of $211.3 million in deposits. Our lots
    controlled include approximately 23,500 optioned lots with a
    remaining purchase price of approximately $875 million for
    which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the
    land or lots, but the contract has not yet been terminated. We
    have written off $30.5 million of deposits and
    $10.3 million of pre-acquisition costs relating to these
    23,500 lots under contract, resulting in a net deposit balance
    of $180.8 million at September 30, 2006. During fiscal
    2006, including the write-offs described above, we wrote off a
    total of $124.7 million of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot


purchase option contracts for which we do not intend to exercise
    our option to purchase the land or lots. Write-offs of earnest
    money deposits and pre-acquisition costs in fiscal 2005 and
    fiscal 2004 were $17.1 million and $20.1 million,
    respectively.

Within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at
    September 30, 2006, there were a limited number of
    contracts, representing only $54.8 million of remaining
    purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which
    may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land
    sellers meeting their obligations. Pursuant to the provisions of
    Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — an interpretation of ARB
    No. 51” as amended (FIN 46), issued by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), we consolidated
    certain variable interest entities with assets of
    $100.4 million related to some of our outstanding land and
    lot option purchase contracts.

At September 30, 2006, we had a total of approximately
    28,500 homes in inventory, including approximately 1,900 model
    homes and approximately 440 unsold homes that had been completed
    for more than six months. At September 30, 2005, we had a
    total of approximately 23,200 homes in inventory, including
    approximately 1,600 model homes and approximately 200 unsold
    homes that had been completed for more than six months. Of our
    total homes in inventory, 50% and 41% were unsold at
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. In prior
    years, we generally had more homes under construction, closed
    more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the
    third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal
    activity increases our working capital requirements for our
    homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters and increases our funding requirements for the
    mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the
    end of these quarters. As a result, our results of operations
    and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of
    our fiscal year.

In fiscal 2006, 57% of our consolidated revenues was
    attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal
    quarters. In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to
    softening homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2006,
    only 46% of our consolidated operating income was attributable
    to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. This
    decrease was primarily due to the increased use of incentives to
    sell homes and inventory impairment charges and land option cost
    write-offs recorded during the third and fourth quarters of
    fiscal 2006. We expect that we will experience our historical
    seasonal patterns of revenues and operating income in future
    fiscal years.

Inflation

We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely
    affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of
    higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs.
    In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly
    affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to
    prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our
    customers any increases in our costs through increased sales
    prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations. However, during periods of
    softer homebuilding market conditions, we may not be able to
    offset the increases in our costs with higher selling prices.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Certain statements contained in this report, as well as in other
    materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press
    releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders
    and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be
    construed as “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements are based on management’s
    beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information
    currently available to, management. These forward-looking
    statements typically include the words “anticipate,”


“believe,” “consider,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,”
    “intend,” “objective,” “plan,”
    “predict,” “projection,” “seek,”
    “strategy,” “target” or other words of
    similar meaning. Any or all of the forward-looking statements
    included in this report and in any other of our reports or
    public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the
    expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to
    unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result,
    actual results may differ materially from the expectations or
    results we discuss in the forward-looking statements. These
    risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not
    limited to:

•

changes in general economic, real estate construction and other
    business conditions;

Critical
    Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the
    significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying
    financial statements as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and
    for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Each
    of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current
    authoritative literature that collectively comprises
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In
    instances where alternative methods of accounting are
    permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most
    appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results
    of our operations and our financial condition, and have
    consistently applied those methods over each of the periods
    presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting
    policies selected.

Basis of Presentation

— Our financial
    statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of
    its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. We
    have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from
    which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts,
    under the requirements of FIN 46. All significant
    intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize
    homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the
    closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property
    are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the
    buyer’s financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our
    wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an
    adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by
    SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred
    until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party
    investor has been completed. We include amounts in transit from
    title companies at the end of each reporting period in
    homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our
    homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers
    for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes,
    we record the cash deposits


received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the
    contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the
    homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon
    the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our
    title operations as closing services are rendered and title
    insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur
    simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially
    all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies
    to third-party insurers. We recognize the majority of the
    revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the
    mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to
    third-party investors. Origination fees and direct origination
    costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses,
    respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the
    sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans
    are sold. We sell all mortgage loans and related servicing
    rights to third-party investors.

Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited
    recourse provisions. Based on historical experience, we estimate
    and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with
    recourse.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory
    includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development
    and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes
    and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home
    construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur
    after development projects or homes are substantially complete,
    such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such
    as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel
    and division and region management, advertising and
    builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as
    incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. Home construction costs are
    accumulated for each specific home.

We use the specific identification method for the purpose of
    accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes
    closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and
    all applicable land acquisition, land development and related
    costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon
    the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project.
    Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent
    to the initial home closings in a project are generally
    allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the
    project.

When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and
    recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each
    month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales
    the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to
    completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that
    month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual
    recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be
    paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each
    month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on
    closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued.
    Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously
    closed homes could differ from our current accruals,
    historically, differences in amounts have not been significant.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and
    related communities under development are reviewed for potential
    write-downs when impairment indicators are present.
    SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is
    less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows
    are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs, and
    other factors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination
    of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated
    cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks
    associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow
    streams.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, valuation adjustments
    are recorded on finished homes when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value
    less costs to sell the home.


Consolidated Land Inventory Not Owned

— We
    account for our land and lot option purchase contracts in
    accordance with the provisions of FIN 46. FIN 46
    provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of
    interests in certain variable interest entities, which
    FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either
    have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity
    investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
    the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires
    consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to
    a majority of the risk of loss from the entities’
    activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the
    entities’ residual returns or both, defined as the primary
    beneficiary of the variable interest entity.

In the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter
    into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase
    contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for
    the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a
    future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms
    of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits
    are not refundable at our discretion. Under the requirements of
    FIN 46, certain of the option purchase contracts result in
    the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the
    land parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those
    land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest
    entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary
    based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and
    losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the
    primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into
    a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest
    entity is consolidated.

Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated
    variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to
    FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence
    over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our
    requests for financial information are denied by the land
    sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of
    such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the
    assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the
    remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are
    purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have
    no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or
    lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority
    interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable
    interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest
    entities have no recourse against us.

Warranty Costs

— We have established warranty
    reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty
    liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged
    to be adequate to cover expected warranty-related costs for
    materials and labor required under one- and ten-year warranty
    obligation periods. The one-year warranty is comprehensive for
    all parts and labor; the ten-year period is for major
    construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon
    our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which
    we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect
    qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and
    the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future
    warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
    amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to
    estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material
    change in our accrual.

Insurance Claim Costs

— We have, and require
    the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general
    liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and
    workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect
    us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to
    certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage
    limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or
    expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general
    liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from
    subcontractors. We self-insure a portion of our overall risk,
    partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which
    issues a general liability policy to us, naming some
    subcontractors as additional insureds.

We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover
    our self-insured and deductible amounts under our insurance
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our
    coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an
    analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
    Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to
    a high degree of variability due to uncertainties


such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our
    markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement
    patterns, insurance industry practices and legal
    interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of
    judgment required in determining these estimated liability
    amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our
    currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the claim rate or
    the average cost per claim used to estimate the self-insured
    accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess of
    purchase price over net assets acquired. Pursuant to the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,” we review goodwill for potential
    impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant an
    earlier review. Impairment is determined to exist when the
    estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying
    value. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we measured the fair
    value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model
    and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was
    greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of
    goodwill existed.

We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have
    occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not
    be recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures required by
    SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive
    estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties
    associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from
    such estimates. Continued softness in the homebuilding industry
    may result in the determination that some of our goodwill has
    become impaired, which would result in a potentially significant
    charge to reflect goodwill impairment.

Income Taxes

— We calculate a provision for
    income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by
    identifying the temporary differences arising from the different
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In
    determining the future tax consequences of events that have been
    recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment
    is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual
    outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material
    impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
    position.

Stock-based Compensation

— With the approval of
    our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of
    our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees
    and directors options to purchase our common stock. The
    committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining
    available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our
    common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with
    exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on
    the date of the option grant. The majority of the options
    granted vest ratably over a ten-year period.

On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate
    the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based awards
    at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions,
    which involve a number of variables. These variables include,
    but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over
    the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected
    stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use
    judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are
    expected to be forfeited.

Prior to October 1, 2005, we accounted for stock option
    grants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
    Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
    recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants since
    all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market
    value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157; however, it is


not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements,” which addresses how the effects of prior-year
    uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be
    considered in current-year financial statements. The SAB
    requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both
    balance-sheet and income-statement approaches and to evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is
    material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative
    factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective
    for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year
    ending after November 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating
    the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108; however, it
    is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB
    Statement 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive
    model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in
    the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be
    taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or
    not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    FIN 48; however, it is not expected to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets —
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140,” which
    provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like
    (offset) accounting by allowing a company the option to carry
    mortgage servicing rights at fair value. This new Statement
    amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities — a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 125,” with respect to the accounting for
    separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
    liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective for all
    separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the
    beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted in
    certain circumstances. Since we do not retain the servicing
    rights when we sell our mortgage loans held for sale, the
    adoption of SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of
    APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.”
    This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for
    and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and requires
    retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to
    prior periods’ financial statements unless it is
    impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the
    cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is
    effective for us for accounting changes and corrections of
    errors made after October 1, 2006, the beginning of our
    fiscal year 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not
    expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We
    monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize
    both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes
    in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt
    instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for
    variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not
    impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our
    future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure
    to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by
    entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed
    interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We
    generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt
    prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and
    changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our
    cash flows related to our fixed-rate debt until such time as we
    are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt.


Our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” We are exposed to
    interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair values of
    the swaps, and such changes must be reflected in our income
    statements.

Our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated
    with its mortgage loan origination services. Interest rate lock
    commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied
    for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting
    criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six
    months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific
    investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being
    committed to third-party investors. We manage interest rate risk
    related to uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of
    mortgage-backed securities (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar
    Futures Contracts (EDFC) on certain loan types. FMBS and EDFC
    related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as
    non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses
    recognized in current earnings. FMBS and EDFC related to funded,
    uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with
    changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in
    current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded,
    uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is
    continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the
    years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not
    significant, is recognized in current earnings. At
    September 30, 2006, FMBS and EDFC to mitigate interest rate
    risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and
    uncommitted IRLCs totaled $1,007.5 million. Uncommitted
    IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than six months,
    totaled approximately $256.1 million, and uncommitted
    mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately
    $368.5 million at September 30, 2006. The fair value
    of the FMBS, EDFC and IRLCs at September 30, 2006 was an
    insignificant amount.

In an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering
    homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing,
    we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from
    future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage
    originations of approximately $599 million. To accomplish
    this, we purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic
    interest rate hedges in the form of FMBS and put options on both
    EDFC and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). At September 30,
    2006, the notional amount of the FRAs was $354 million,
    while economic interest rate hedges totaled $2.4 billion in
    EDFC put options and $104 million in MBS put options,
    hedging a notional principal of $245 million in mortgage
    loan commitments. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate
    hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months.
    These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and
    are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized
    in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 were not significant.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected
    maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair
    value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2006. In
    addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted
    average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest
    rate swaps. Because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and
    CP conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held
    for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, the
    outstanding balances at September 30, 2006 are included in
    the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending
    September 30, 2007. At September 30, 2006, the fair
    value of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million
    liability.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

D.R. Horton, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    September 30, 2006. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note H, the Company has restated its
    segment disclosures.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of D.R. Horton, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    December 6, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A — SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D. R. Horton, Inc.
    and all of its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled
    subsidiaries (which are referred to as the Company, unless the
    context otherwise requires), as well as certain variable
    interest entities required to be consolidated pursuant to
    Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — an interpretation of ARB
    No. 51,” as amended (FIN 46), issued by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). All significant
    intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to
    the fiscal 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had no
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Stock
    Splits

In February 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors declared
    a

four-for-three

stock split (effected as a


/


%
    stock dividend), paid on March 16, 2005 to common
    stockholders of record on March 1, 2005. The earnings per
    share and cash dividends declared per share for the year ended
    September 30, 2004 reflect the effects of the stock split.

Revenue
    Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized
    at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and
    possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In
    situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI
    Mortgage, the Company’s wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary,
    and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
    investment as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real
    Estate,” the profit on such sales is deferred until the
    sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has
    been completed. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    had deferred profit on such sales in the amounts of
    $90.6 million and $92.2 million, respectively.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s
    title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered
    and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally
    occur simultaneously as each home is closed. The majority of the
    revenues associated with the Company’s mortgage operations
    is recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing
    rights are sold to third-party investors. Origination fees and
    direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues
    and expenses, respectively, along with the associated gains and
    losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights,
    when the loans are sold. Interest income is accrued from the
    date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
    initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. Amounts in transit from title companies for
    home closings are included in cash. Additionally, the Company
    holds cash that is restricted as to its use. Restricted cash
    related

to the Company’s homebuilding operations includes customer
    deposits that are temporarily restricted in accordance with
    regulatory requirements, and cash restricted pursuant to
    insurance related regulatory requirements. At September 30,
    2006 and 2005, the balances of restricted cash were
    $38.8 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and are
    included in other assets on the Company’s balance sheet.

Borrowings by the Company’s mortgage subsidiary under the
    CP conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage
    loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings
    under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans
    as collateral. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the balances
    of cash restricted for this purpose were $248.3 million and
    $0, respectively.

Inventories
    and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land
    development and home construction, capitalized interest, real
    estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during
    development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead
    costs incurred after development projects or homes are
    substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance and
    cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative
    (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs,
    such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales
    personnel and division and region management, advertising and
    builder’s risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as
    incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. Home construction costs are
    accumulated for each specific home.

The specific identification method is used for the purpose of
    accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes
    closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and
    all applicable land acquisition, land development and related
    costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon
    the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project.
    Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent
    to the initial home closings in a project are generally
    allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the
    project.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not yet paid
    and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home.
    Each month a liability and a charge to cost of sales is recorded
    for the amount that is determined will ultimately be paid
    related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end
    of that month. The home construction budgets are compared to
    actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs
    remaining to be paid on each closed home. The accuracy of each
    month’s accrual is monitored by comparing actual costs
    incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount
    previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the
    future on previously closed homes could differ from the
    Company’s current accruals, historically, differences in
    amounts have not been significant.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” land
    inventory and related communities under development are reviewed
    for potential write-downs when impairment indicators are
    present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges
    are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is
    less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows
    are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs, and
    other factors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process,
    actual results could differ from such estimates. For those
    assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
    measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company’s
    determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting
    the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the
    inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
    cash flow streams.


D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, valuation adjustments
    are recorded on finished homes when events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value
    less costs to sell the home.

During fiscal 2006, several communities under development that
    demonstrated potential impairment indicators were evaluated for
    potential impairment. The Company’s analyses of these
    projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared
    with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues
    realized from comparable projects. It was determined that
    projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority
    of which were in California, were impaired. Consequently, an
    impairment charge of $146.2 million was recorded to reduce the
    carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair
    value. The remaining projects with impairment indicators are
    primarily in California. It is possible that the estimate of
    undiscounted cash flows from these projects may change and could
    result in a future need to record an impairment charge to write
    these assets down to fair value. Additionally, if conditions in
    the homebuilding industry worsen in the future, the Company may
    be required to evaluate additional projects for potential
    impairment which may result in additional impairment charges and
    such charges could be significant.

From time to time, the Company writes off earnest money deposits
    and pre-acquisition costs related to land and lot option
    contracts which it no longer plans to pursue. During fiscal
    2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company wrote off $124.7 million,
    $17.1 million and $20.1 million, respectively, of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land
    option contracts which it decided not to pursue.

Homebuilding
    Interest

The Company capitalizes homebuilding interest costs to inventory
    during development and construction. Capitalized interest is
    charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered
    to the buyer. The following table summarizes the Company’s
    homebuilding interest costs incurred, capitalized, charged to
    cost of sales and expensed directly during the years ended
    September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Consolidated
    Land Inventory Not Owned

The Company accounts for its land and lot option purchase
    contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46.
    FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and
    reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities,
    which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that
    either have equity investors with no voting rights or have
    equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
    resources for the entities to support their activities.
    FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any
    company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
    the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a
    majority of the entities’ residual returns or both, defined
    as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity.

In the ordinary course of its homebuilding business, the Company
    enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option
    purchase contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in
    consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
    land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms.
    Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of the
    option deposits are not refundable at the Company’s
    discretion. Under the requirements of FIN 46,


D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

certain of the Company’s option purchase contracts result
    in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the
    land parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46, the Company evaluates
    those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable
    interest entities to determine whether the Company is the
    primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of
    the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this
    evaluation, if the Company is the primary beneficiary of an
    entity with which the Company has entered into a land or lot
    option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is
    consolidated.

Since the Company owns no equity interest in any of the
    unaffiliated variable interest entities that it must consolidate
    pursuant to FIN 46, the Company generally has little or no
    control or influence over the operations of these entities or
    their owners. When the Company’s requests for financial
    information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions
    about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required.
    In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated
    entities have been assumed to be the remaining contractual
    purchase price of the land or lots the Company is purchasing. In
    these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt
    obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots the
    Company has the option to buy with a related offset to minority
    interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable
    interest entity.

The consolidation of these variable interest entities and other
    inventory obligations added $100.4 million and
    $200.4 million in land inventory not owned and minority
    interests related to entities not owned to the Company’s
    balance sheets at September 30, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company’s obligations related to these
    land or lot option contracts are guaranteed by cash deposits
    totaling $17.6 million and $21.3 million and
    performance letters of credit, promissory notes and surety bonds
    totaling $2.5 million and $5.9 million, as of
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Creditors, if
    any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse
    against the Company. For the variable interest entities which
    are unconsolidated because the Company is not subject to a
    majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority
    of the entities’ residual returns, the maximum exposure to
    loss is generally limited to the amounts of the Company’s
    option deposits, which totaled $137.1 million at
    September 30, 2006.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
    asset. Depreciable lives for model home furniture typically
    range from 2 to 3 years, depreciable lives for office
    furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years,
    and depreciable lives for buildings and improvements typically
    range from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
    $130.0 million and $141.3 million as of
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depreciation
    expense was $56.5 million, $52.8 million and
    $43.7 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets
    acquired. Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the Company
    reviews goodwill for potential impairment annually or when
    events and circumstances warrant an earlier review. Impairment
    is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill
    is less than its carrying value. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and
    2004, the Company measured the fair value of its reporting units
    using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair
    value of its reporting units was greater than their book value
    and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed.

The Company regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances
    have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill
    may not be recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures
    required by SFAS No. 142 require management to make
    comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the
    uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results
    could differ from such estimates. Continued

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

softness in the homebuilding industry may result in the
    determination that some of the Company’s goodwill has
    become impaired, which would result in a potentially significant
    charge to reflect goodwill impairment.

Accumulated amortization related to goodwill was
    $38.9 million at September 30, 2006 and 2005. Other
    intangible assets, which are amortized over their useful lives,
    were fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2004, and therefore,
    their carrying values were $0 as of and subsequent to
    September 30, 2004. Amortization of other intangible assets
    was $3.7 million in fiscal 2004.

Warranty
    Costs

The Company typically provides its homebuyers a one-year
    comprehensive limited warranty for all parts and labor and a
    ten-year limited warranty for major construction defects. Since
    the Company subcontracts its homebuilding work to subcontractors
    who typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of
    insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims
    relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary
    responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have
    been established by charging cost of sales for each home
    delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s
    estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired
    warranty obligation periods. The Company’s warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which it operates and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    built and the geographic areas in which they are built.

Changes in the Company’s warranty liability were as follows:

Insurance
    Claim Costs

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors
    to have, general liability insurance (including construction
    defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These
    insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its
    risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
    retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In certain
    states where the Company believes it is too difficult or
    expensive for subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, the Company has waived its traditional subcontractor
    general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids
    from subcontractors. The Company self insures a portion of its
    overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance
    entity which issues a general liability policy to the Company,
    naming certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The
    Company records expenses and liabilities related to the costs to
    cover its self-insured and deductible amounts under those
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of its
    coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an
    analysis of the Company’s historical claims, which includes
    an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Expenses
    related to such claims were approximately $41.7 million,
    $101.2 million and $80.9 million in fiscal 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
    Advertising expense was approximately $110.6 million,
    $78.9 million and $64.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is calculated using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the
    financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average
    number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year.
    Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average
    number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities
    outstanding.

The following table sets forth the numerators and denominators
    used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share.
    The average share amounts for fiscal 2004 reflect the effects of
    the

four-for-three

stock split, paid as a stock dividend on March 16, 2005.
    For fiscal 2006, options to purchase 3.0 million shares of
    common stock were not included in the computation of diluted
    earnings per share because the exercise price was greater than
    the average market price of the common shares and, therefore,
    their effect would be antidilutive. All options were included in
    the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2005
    and 2004.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements. Prior to
    October 1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock option
    grants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
    recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants since
    all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market
    value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

SFAS No. 123(R) was adopted using the modified
    prospective method. Under this method, the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) apply to all awards granted or
    modified after the date of adoption. In addition, compensation
    expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards
    outstanding as of the date of adoption on a straight-line basis
    over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of the
    options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Results of prior periods have not been restated. In
    addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires the benefits of tax
    deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be
    reported in the Statement of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow
    rather than an operating cash flow as previously reported.

Interest
    Rate Swaps

The Company entered into two ten-year interest rate swap
    agreements in 1998 with a major United States bank under which
    it receives each quarter the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
    (LIBOR) and pays a fixed amount that averages 5.1% on a total
    notional amount of $200 million. At the end of each
    quarter, the swaps’ market value will have changed
    depending upon the market’s current anticipation of
    quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the present until the
    swaps’ maturity in 2008. The swaps’ market values
    generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future LIBOR
    rates. The swaps do not qualify as cash-flow hedges under
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” so changes in the
    swaps’ fair value must be recorded in the consolidated
    statements of income. The fair values of the interest rate swaps
    were liabilities to the Company of $0.1 million at
    September 30, 2006 and $3.2 million at
    September 30, 2005, and are recorded in homebuilding other
    liabilities. Changes in their fair values are recorded in
    homebuilding other income or expense. During the years ended
    September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company had gains
    related to the interest rate swaps of $3.1 million,
    $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively.

Mortgage
    Loans

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family
    residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.
    Loans that have been closed but not committed to a third-party
    investor are matched with either forward sales of
    mortgage-backed securities (FMBS) or Eurodollar Futures
    Contracts (EDFC) that are designated as fair value hedges.
    Hedged loans are either committed to third-party investors
    within three days of origination or pooled and committed in bulk
    to third-party investors typically within 30 days of
    origination. Loans held for sale are carried at cost adjusted
    for changes in fair value after the date of designation of an
    effective accounting hedge, based on either sale commitments or
    current market quotes. Loans held for sale, not subject to an
    effective accounting hedge are carried at the lower of cost or
    fair value. Any gain or loss on the sale of loans is recognized
    at the time of sale. During the years ended September 30,
    2006, 2005 and


D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2004, the Company had net gains on sales of loans of
    $145.5 million, $113.5 million, and
    $87.5 million, respectively.

Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited
    recourse provisions. Based on historical experience, the Company
    has estimated and recorded a total allowance or reserve for
    loans held in portfolio or loans held for sale or for losses
    related to loans sold with recourse of $15.6 million and
    $4.1 million at September 30, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The notional amounts of the FMBS and the EDFC used to hedge
    mortgage loans held for sale can vary in relationship to the
    underlying loan amounts, depending on the typical movements in
    the value of each hedging instrument relative to the value of
    the underlying mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2006,
    the Company had $368.5 million in loans not committed to
    third-party investors which were hedged with $578.0 million
    of FMBS and EDFC.

The FMBS and EDFC associated with uncommitted, funded loans are
    designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the
    overall fair value of the related loans. Accordingly, changes in
    the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in
    current earnings, as are changes in the value of the loans.
    During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, the Company’s net gains related to the ineffective
    portion of its fair value hedging instruments were
    insignificant. The net gains are included in financial services
    revenues.

Loan Commitments

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is
    party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are
    extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet
    certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, and related Derivatives
    Implementation Group conclusions, the Company classifies and
    accounts for IRLCs as non-designated derivative instruments at
    fair value. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company’s IRLCs totaled $647.7 million and
    $622.8 million, respectively.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs
    through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments,
    FMBS and the purchase of EDFC. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. As of
    September 30, 2006, the Company had approximately
    $391.6 million of best-efforts whole loan delivery
    commitments and $429.5 million outstanding of FMBS and EDFC
    related to its uncommitted IRLCs.

In an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering
    homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing,
    the Company began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects it
    from future increases in interest rates related to potential
    mortgage originations of approximately $599 million. To
    accomplish this, the Company purchases forward rate agreements
    (FRAs) and economic interest rate hedges in the form of FMBS and
    put options on both EDFC and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
    At September 30, 2006, the notional amount of the FRAs was
    $354 million, while economic interest rate hedges totaled
    $2.4 billion in EDFC put options and $104 million in
    MBS put options, hedging a notional principal of
    $245 million in mortgage loan commitments. Both the FRAs
    and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not
    exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. The gains
    and losses for the year ended September 30, 2006 were not
    significant.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157; however, it is
    not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108,
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements,” which addresses how the effects of prior year
    uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be
    considered in current year financial statements. The SAB
    requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both
    balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is
    material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative
    factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective
    for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year
    ending after November 15, 2006. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108;
    however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48
    (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB
    Statement 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive
    model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in
    the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be
    taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or
    not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
    adoption of FIN 48; however, it is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
    “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets,” which
    provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge-like
    (offset) accounting by allowing the Company the option to carry
    mortgage servicing rights at fair value. This new Statement
    amends SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers
    and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities — a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 125,” with respect to the accounting for
    separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
    liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective for all
    separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the
    beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
    September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted in
    certain circumstances. Since the Company does not retain the
    servicing rights when it sells its mortgage loans held for sale,
    the adoption of SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of
    APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.”
    This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for
    and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and requires
    retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to
    prior periods’ financial statements unless it is
    impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or the
    cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is
    effective for the Company for accounting changes and corrections
    of errors made after October 1, 2006, the beginning of
    fiscal year 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Homebuilding:

In December 2005, the Company entered into a $2.15 billion
    unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a
    $1.0 billion letter of credit

sub-facility.

The revolving credit facility has an uncommitted
    $750 million accordion provision which could be used to
    increase the facility to $2.9 billion. This credit
    facility, which matures on December 16, 2010, replaced the
    Company’s previous $1.21 billion credit facility. The
    Company’s borrowing capacity under the new facility is
    reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding. At
    September 30, 2006, the Company’s borrowing capacity
    under the facility was $1.23 billion. The facility is
    guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s
    wholly-owned subsidiaries other than its financial services
    subsidiaries. Borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the
    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon
    the Company’s ratio of homebuilding debt to total
    capitalization and its senior unsecured debt rating. The
    interest rates of the unsecured bank debt at September 30,
    2006 and 2005 were 6.1% and 5.1%, respectively. In addition to
    the stated interest rates, the revolving credit facility
    requires the Company to pay certain fees.

In November 2006, the Company obtained additional commitments of
    $350 million under the revolving credit facility’s
    accordion provision and increased the current capacity of the
    facility to $2.5 billion. Additionally, the maturity of the
    facility was extended by one year to December 16, 2011.

Following is a summary of the key terms of each of the
    Company’s unsecured homebuilding notes payable outstanding
    as of September 30, 2006, including the annual effective
    interest rate of each series of notes, after giving effect to
    the amortization of discounts and deferred financing costs.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company may redeem the notes in whole at any time or in part
    from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of
    100% of their principal amount or the present value of the
    remaining scheduled payments on the redemption date, plus in
    each case, accrued interest.

All series of senior notes and borrowings under the revolving
    credit facility are senior obligations of the Company and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to all existing and future
    unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and senior to all
    existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated to them.
    The senior subordinated notes rank behind all existing and
    future senior notes and bank credit facilities. Both the senior
    and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially
    all of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries other than
    its financial services subsidiaries. Upon a change of control of
    the Company, holders of all series of notes issued prior to
    October 2004 have the right to require the Company to redeem
    such notes at a price of 101% of the par amount, along with
    accrued and unpaid interest.

On March 15, 2006, the Company redeemed its
    9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 at an aggregate
    redemption price of approximately $209.4 million, plus
    accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, the Company
    recorded interest expense of approximately $10.6 million,
    representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and
    fees related to the redeemed notes.

In April 2006, the Company issued $500 million principal
    amount of 6.5% senior notes due April 15, 2016 and
    $250 million principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due
    April 15, 2011. The notes, which were issued as separate
    series with interest payable semi-annually, represent unsecured
    obligations of the Company. The Company may redeem the notes in
    whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption
    price equal to the greater of 100% of their principal amount or
    the present value of the remaining scheduled payments on the
    redemption date, discounted at a rate equal to the yield to
    maturity of a United States Treasury security with a comparable
    maturity, plus 25 basis points (0.25%) with respect to the
    $500 million senior notes, and plus 20 basis points (0.20%)
    with respect to the $250 million senior notes, plus, in
    each case, accrued interest. The annual effective interest rate
    of the $500 million senior notes and the $250 million
    senior notes, after giving effect to the amortization of
    deferred financing costs is 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively. The
    Company used the proceeds from these offerings for the repayment
    of borrowings under the revolving credit facility.

In July 2006, the Company redeemed its 10.5% senior
    subordinated notes due 2011. The notes, which were originally
    issued by Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed by the Company in
    its merger with Schuler in February 2002, were redeemed at an
    aggregate price of approximately $152.4 million, plus
    accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, the Company
    recorded interest expense of approximately $2.8 million,
    representing the call premium, net of the unamortized premium
    related to the redeemed notes.

In November 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company’s
    outstanding debt securities, replacing the previous debt
    securities repurchase authorization. All of the
    $200 million authorization was remaining at
    September 30, 2006. In November 2006, the Board of
    Directors increased the debt repurchase authorization to
    $500 million and extended its term to November 30,
    2007.

The revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the
    senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the
    Company’s operations and activities. The most significant
    restrictions relate to limits on investments, cash dividends,
    stock repurchases and other restricted payments, incurrence of
    indebtedness, creation of liens and asset dispositions, and
    require maintenance of certain levels of leverage, interest
    coverage and tangible net worth. In addition, the indentures
    governing the senior notes impose restrictions on the creation
    of liens.

The indentures governing approximately $2.0 billion of the
    senior notes provided for the termination of specified covenants
    upon the Company’s attainment of investment grade ratings
    from both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group and
    Moody’s Investors Service Inc. These covenants included
    restrictions on cash dividends, stock repurchases and other
    restricted payments, incurrence of indebtedness and asset
    dispositions. The Company


D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

achieved both of the required ratings as of April 2006. As a
    result, the foregoing restrictions have ceased to apply with
    respect to these senior notes and will not apply in the future
    with respect to them even if the Company’s ratings change.

At September 30, 2006, under the most restrictive covenants
    in effect, cash dividend payments in fiscal 2007 were limited to
    $583.5 million and approximately $3.4 billion was
    available for all restricted payments in the future.

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to help manage a
    portion of its interest rate exposure. The agreements convert a
    notional amount of $200 million from a variable rate to a
    fixed rate. These agreements are cancelable by the
    counter-party, a major U.S. bank, during periods where
    LIBOR exceeds 7%. The agreements expire at dates through
    September 2008. The Company does not expect non-performance by
    the counter-party, and any losses incurred in the event of
    non-performance are not expected to be material. Net payments or
    receipts under these agreements are recorded as adjustments to
    interest incurred. As a result of these agreements, the
    Company’s net interest costs in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004
    were increased by $0.8 million, $4.9 million and
    $7.5 million, respectively.

Financial
    Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary has a $540 million
    mortgage warehouse loan facility that matures April 6,
    2007, which replaced its previous $300 million facility
    that matured on April 7, 2006. At various times during
    fiscal 2005 and until its maturity in 2006, the Company obtained
    additional temporary commitments from its lenders through the
    facility’s accordion provision and through amendments to
    the credit agreement. These commitments resulted in total
    capacity amounts of up to $675 million depending on the
    terms in effect. Under the accordion provision of the credit
    agreement, the total capacity may be increased to
    $750 million upon consent of the lenders.

The mortgage warehouse facility is secured by certain mortgage
    loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc.
    or any of the guarantors of its homebuilding debt. The borrowing
    capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the
    unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a
    borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation,
    the amount drawn on the facility may not exceed 98% of all
    eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the
    lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility. Borrowings
    bear daily interest at the

30-day

LIBOR
    rate plus a fixed premium. The interest rates of the mortgage
    warehouse line payable at September 30, 2006 and 2005 were
    6.1% and 4.7%, respectively.

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary also has a
    $1.2 billion commercial paper conduit facility (the CP
    conduit facility), that matures June 27, 2009, which
    replaced its previous $500 million facility that matured on
    June 29, 2006. The $1.2 billion CP conduit facility is
    subject to the annual renewal of the

364-day

backup liquidity feature.

The CP conduit facility is secured by certain mortgage loans
    held for sale and is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any
    of the guarantors of its homebuilding debt. Additionally, at
    September 30, 2006, borrowings under the CP conduit
    facility are secured by restricted cash arising from borrowings
    under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans
    held for sale as collateral. The mortgage loans assigned to
    secure the CP conduit facility are used as collateral for
    asset-backed commercial paper issued by multi-seller conduits in
    the commercial paper market. The interest rates of the CP
    conduit facility at September 30, 2006 and 2005 were 5.6%
    and 4.3%, respectively.

In November 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s
    common stock, replacing the previous common stock repurchase
    authorization. During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased
    1,000,000 shares of its common stock at a total cost of
    $36.8 million, all of which occurred during the three
    months ended December 31, 2005. As of September 30,
    2006, the Company had $463.2 million remaining of the Board
    of Directors’ authorization for repurchases of common
    stock. In November 2006, the Board of Directors extended the
    remaining $463.2 million common stock repurchase
    authorization to November 30, 2007.

On January 26, 2006, the Company’s shareholders

On June 13, 2006, the Company filed with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission an automatically effective universal shelf
    registration statement registering debt and equity securities
    which the Company may issue from time to time in amounts to be
    determined. Also, at September 30, 2006, the Company had
    the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of
    common stock under its acquisition shelf registration statement,
    to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business
    acquisitions.

During fiscal 2006, the Board of Directors declared one
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share, two
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share, and one
    quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, the last
    of which was paid on September 1, 2006 to stockholders of

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all Company employees who have
    been with the Company for a period of six months or more. The
    Company matches portions of employees’ voluntary
    contributions. Additional employer contributions in the form of
    profit sharing are at the discretion of the Company. Expenses
    for the plan were $12.5 million, $9.2 million and
    $7.5 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
    is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides
    benefits payable to certain management employees upon
    retirement, death, or termination of employment with the
    Company. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit
    based on a percentage of the eligible employees’ salaries,
    as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined
    formula. The Company’s liabilities related to the SERP were
    $9.7 million and $8.4 million at September 30,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company recorded
    $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.5 million of
    expense for this plan in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a
    select group of employees. The participating employees designate
    investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not
    required to invest the contributions in the designated
    investments. The Company’s net liabilities related to the
    deferred

compensation plan were $80.8 million and $53.3 million
    at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
    records as expense the amount that the employee contributions
    would have earned had the funds been invested in the designated
    investments. The Company recorded $7.5 million,
    $7.6 million and $2.2 million of expense for this plan
    in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides
    eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of
    the Company at a discounted price of at least 85% of the fair
    market value of the stock on the designated dates of purchase.
    The price may be further discounted depending on the average
    fair market value of the stock during the period and certain
    other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair
    market value of the common stock that an eligible employee may
    purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the
    employee’s annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan,
    employees of the Company purchased 158,444 shares for
    $4.5 million in fiscal 2006, 95,669 shares for
    $1.9 million in fiscal 2005 and 86,035 shares for
    $2.5 million in fiscal 2004.

On January 26, 2006, the Company’s shareholders
    approved the D.R. Horton, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which
    replaced the Company’s 1991 Stock Incentive Plan. The
    aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Stock
    Incentive Plan includes the new authorization of
    28.0 million shares, plus approximately 1.9 million
    shares that remained available for awards under the 1991 Stock
    Incentive Plan on that date. Total shares available for awards
    under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to increase by
    subsequent specified terminations of awards under the 1991 Stock
    Incentive Plan that were outstanding on January 26, 2006.
    For awards other than options or stock appreciation rights, the
    shares available for issuance under the 2006 Stock Incentive
    Plan will be reduced at the rate of 1.75 shares for each
    share subject to the award.

The Company’s Stock Incentive Plan provides for the
    granting of stock options to certain key employees of the
    Company to purchase shares of common stock. Options are granted
    at exercise prices which equal the market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. Options
    generally expire 10 years after the dates on which they
    were granted. Options generally vest over periods of 5 to
    9.75 years. There were 28.1 million and
    1.7 million shares available for future grants under the
    Plans at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

On October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), which requires that companies measure
    and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the
    fair value of share-based payments granted under compensation
    arrangements. SFAS No. 123(R) was adopted using the
    modified prospective method. Results of prior periods have not
    been restated.

On May 2, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Directors granted stock options to the
    Company’s executive officers, other officers and certain of
    its employees, and the Company’s Board of Directors granted
    stock options to its outside directors, to purchase
    approximately 3.0 million shares of its common stock, at a
    price of $29.44 per share, the closing market price of its
    common stock on the date of grant.

The weighted average fair value of grants made in fiscal 2006,
    2005 and 2004 was $14.85, $18.42 and $12.34 per share,
    respectively. All amounts reflect the

    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a

NOTE F —
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
    based on quoted market prices, where available, or are
    estimated. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in
    time based on relevant market information and information about
    the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in
    nature, involve matters of judgment and therefore, cannot be
    determined with precision. Estimated fair values are
    significantly affected by the assumptions used. The
    Company’s methods and assumptions used in estimating fair
    values are described below.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, the revolving
    credit facility, the mortgage warehouse facility, the commercial
    paper conduit facility and other secured notes payable as
    reported in the Company’s balance sheets approximate their
    fair values due to their short maturity or floating interest
    rate terms, as applicable.

For the senior and senior subordinated notes, fair values
    represent quoted market prices. For the interest rate swaps,
    fair values represent market values as determined by the issuer
    of the swaps based upon the market’s current anticipation
    of future LIBOR rate levels. For mortgage loans held for sale,
    forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and interest rate
    lock commitments, the fair values are estimated based on quoted
    market prices for similar financial instruments. The following
    table sets forth the carrying values and estimated fair values
    of the Company’s senior and senior subordinated notes,
    interest rate swaps, mortgage loans held for sale, forward sales
    of mortgage-backed securities and interest rate lock commitments.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has been named as defendant in various claims,
    complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Management believes that, while the outcome
    of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the
    liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the
    liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds management’s estimates reflected in the recorded
    liabilities relating to such matter, the Company could incur
    additional charges that could be significant.

The Company has recorded liabilities for contingencies occurring
    in the ordinary course of business, including warranty and
    construction defect claims on closed homes and the expected
    costs of the self-insured portion of general liability and
    workers compensation insurance claims. The Company’s
    estimates of such liabilities are based on the facts and
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends, including but not limited to costs relative to
    revenues, home closings and product types, and include estimates
    of the costs of unreported claims related to past operations.
    These liability estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are
    recorded in the accounting period in which the change in
    estimate occurs. The Company’s total liabilities for such
    items were $361.2 million and $329.9 million at
    September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land
    and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. At September 30, 2006,
    the Company had total deposits of $211.3 million, comprised
    of cash deposits of $187.2 million, promissory notes of
    $13.1 million, and letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $11.0 million, to purchase land and lots with a total
    remaining purchase price of $4.0 billion. Included within
    the total deposits at September 30, 2006, were deposits
    aggregating $30.5 million related to purchase contracts
    representing $874.9 million of remaining purchase price for
    which the Company does not expect to exercise its option to
    purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not yet been
    terminated. Consequently, $30.5 million of deposits
    relating to these contracts were written off, resulting in a net
    deposit balance of $180.8 million at September 30,
    2006. Only $54.8 million of the $4.0 billion in land
    and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance
    clauses which may require the Company to purchase the land or
    lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. The
    majority of land and lots under contract are expected to be
    purchased within three years.


D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Additionally, in the normal course of its business activities,
    the Company provides standby letters of credit and surety bonds,
    issued by third parties, to secure performance under various
    contracts. At September 30, 2006, outstanding standby
    letters of credit were $128.2 million and surety bonds were
    $2.3 billion. The Company has an additional capacity of
    $881.2 million for standby letters of credit under its revolving
    credit facility.

The Company leases office space and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum annual lease payments

    REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s seven homebuilding operating regions and its
    financial services operation are its operating segments under
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.” The homebuilding
    operating regions have historically been aggregated into a
    single reportable homebuilding segment. During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reassessed the aggregation
    of its operating segments, and as a result, restated its
    disclosure to include six separate reportable homebuilding
    segments and one financial services segment. Two of the
    homebuilding operating regions were aggregated into one
    reporting segment based on their economic similarities. Under
    this revised presentation, the Company’s reportable
    homebuilding segments are: Northeast, Southeast, South Central,
    Southwest, California and West. These reporting segments have
    homebuilding operations located in the following states:

Northeast:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only),
    Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico,
    Texas (Lubbock only) and Utah

California:

California and Nevada (Reno only)

West:

Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and
    Washington

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating 98%
    of consolidated revenues and 95% to 96% of consolidated income
    before income taxes in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
    Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily engaged in
    the acquisition and development of land for residential purposes
    and the construction and sale of residential homes on such land,
    in 27 states and 84 markets in the United States. The
    homebuilding segments generate most of their revenues from the
    sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of
    land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage
    banking and title agency services principally to customers of
    the Company’s homebuilding segments. The Company does not
    retain or service the mortgages that it originates, but, rather,
    sells the mortgages and related servicing rights to investors.
    The

financial services segment generates its revenues from
    originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title
    insurance agency and closing services.

All basic and diluted per share amounts presented above reflect
    the effects of the

four-for-three

stock split (effected as a


/


%
    stock dividend) of March 16, 2005.

The Company experiences variability in its results of operations
    from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of its
    homebuilding business. Historically, the Company has closed a
    greater number of homes in the third and fourth (June and
    September) fiscal quarters than in the first and second
    (December and March) fiscal quarters. As a result, revenues and
    net income typically have been higher in the third and fourth
    quarters of the fiscal year; however, in fiscal 2006, due to
    softening market conditions in many of the markets in which the
    Company operates, only 46% of its consolidated net income for
    the year was generated in the third and fourth quarters of the
    fiscal year.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144 as discussed in the
    Company’s inventories and cost of sales accounting policies
    in Note A, an impairment charge in the amount of
    $142.0 million was recorded as a reduction of gross profit
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally, the Company
    wrote off earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs
    related to land and lot option contracts it no longer plans to
    pursue in the amount of $57.1 million and
    $57.2 million as a reduction of gross profit in the third
    and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 66 as discussed in the
    Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies in
    Note A, revenues from home sales in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005 were reduced by a $92.2 million deferral of
    profit at September 30, 2005. Quarterly revenues from home
    sales during fiscal 2006 were not significantly affected by the
    deferral and recognition of profit in accordance with
    SFAS No. 66.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

The Company’s management has long recognized its
    responsibilities for developing, implementing and monitoring
    effective and efficient controls and procedures. As part of
    those responsibilities, as of September 30, 2006, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that
    evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or
    otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in
    reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure.

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2006 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
    Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting include those policies and
    procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
    that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
    (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting is not intended to
    provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial
    statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of
    any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with internal control policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
    concluded that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2006.
    Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited this assessment of our internal
    control over financial reporting and their report is included
    herein.


REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

D.R. Horton, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting, that D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006,
    based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2006 of D.R. Horton, Inc. and our
    report dated December 6, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.
