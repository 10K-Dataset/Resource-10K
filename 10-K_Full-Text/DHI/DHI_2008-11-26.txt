2008 ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the
    United States, based on homes closed during the twelve months
    ended September 30, 2008. We construct and sell high
    quality homes through our operating divisions in 27 states
    and 77 metropolitan markets of the United States, primarily
    under the name of D.R. Horton,

America’s Builder.

We
    are a Fortune 500 company, and our common stock is included
    in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock
    Exchange under the ticker symbol “DHI.” Unless the
    context otherwise requires, the terms “D.R. Horton,”
    the “Company,” “we” and “our” used
    herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
    its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Donald R. Horton began our homebuilding business in 1978. In
    1991, we were incorporated in Delaware to acquire the assets and
    businesses of our predecessor companies, which were residential
    home construction and development companies owned or controlled
    by Mr. Horton. In 1992, we completed our initial public
    offering of our common stock. The growth of our company over the
    years was achieved by investing available capital into our
    existing homebuilding markets and into

start-up

operations in new markets. Additionally, we acquired numerous
    other homebuilding companies, which strengthened our market
    position in existing markets and expanded our geographic
    presence and product offerings in other markets. Our homes
    generally range in size from 1,000 to 5,000 square feet and
    in price from $90,000 to $900,000. The current downturn in our
    industry has resulted in a decrease in the size of our
    operations during fiscal 2007 and 2008, as we have been affected
    by, and have reacted to, the significantly weakened market for
    new homes. For the year ended September 30, 2008, we closed
    26,396 homes with an average closing sales price of
    approximately $233,500.

Through our financial services operations, we provide mortgage
    financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our
    homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    provides mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of homes we build. We generally do not seek to retain or service
    the mortgages we originate but, rather, seek to sell the
    mortgages and related servicing rights to investors. Our
    subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by
    providing title insurance policies, examination and closing
    services, primarily to the purchasers of our homes.

Our financial reporting segments consist of six homebuilding
    segments and a financial services segment. Our homebuilding
    operations are by far the most substantial part of our business,
    comprising approximately 98% of consolidated revenues, which
    were $6.6 billion in fiscal 2008. Our homebuilding
    operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of
    completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and
    lots. In addition to building traditional single-family detached
    homes, we also build attached homes, such as town homes,
    duplexes, triplexes and condominiums (including some mid-rise
    buildings), which share common walls and roofs. The sale of
    detached homes generated approximately 77%, 81%, and 80% of home
    sales revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our
    financial services segment generates its revenues from
    originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title
    insurance agency and closing services.

We make available, as soon as reasonably practicable, on our
    Internet website all of our reports required to be filed with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports
    include our annual report on

Form 10-K,

Operating
    Strategy

For the greatest part of our company’s existence, we
    maintained significant year-over-year growth and profitability.
    We achieved this growth through an operating strategy focused on
    capturing greater market share, while also maintaining a strong
    balance sheet. To execute our strategy, we invested available
    capital in our existing homebuilding markets and
    opportunistically entered new markets. We also actively
    evaluated homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arose,
    some of which resulted in acquisitions and contributed to our
    growth.

Due to the progressive weakening of demand in our homebuilding
    markets over the past few years, we have experienced declines in
    revenues and gross profit, sustained significant asset
    impairment charges and incurred losses in fiscal 2007 and 2008.
    Although we believe the long-term fundamentals which support
    housing demand, namely population growth and household
    formation, remain solid and the current negative conditions will
    moderate over time, the timing of a recovery in the housing
    market is unclear. Consequently, our primary focus while market
    conditions are weak is to strengthen our financial condition by
    reducing inventories of homes and land, controlling and reducing
    construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows
    from operations, reducing outstanding debt and maintaining
    strong liquidity.

Geographic
    Diversity

From 1978 to late 1987, our homebuilding activities were
    conducted in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. We then began
    diversifying geographically by entering additional markets, both
    through

start-up

operations and acquisitions. We now operate in 27 states
    and 77 markets. This provides us with geographic diversification
    in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of
    revenues and earnings. We believe our diversification strategy
    helps to mitigate the effects of local and regional economic
    cycles and enhances our long-term potential.

Economies
    of Scale

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in
    terms of number of homes closed in fiscal 2008. By the same
    measure, we are also either the largest or one of the five
    largest builders in many of our markets in fiscal 2008. We
    believe that our national, regional and local scale of
    operations has provided us with benefits that may not be
    available in the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders,
    such as:

•

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national,
    regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates
    from certain subcontractors;

•

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative costs, which
    allows us greater flexibility to compete for greater market
    share in each of our markets; and

•

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our strong
    balance sheet and our lending and capital markets relationships
    with national banking institutions.

Decentralized
    Operations

We decentralize our homebuilding activities to give operating
    flexibility to our local division presidents on certain key
    operating decisions. At September 30, 2008, we had 34
    separate homebuilding operating divisions, some of which operate
    in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division
    consists of a division president; land entitlement, acquisition
    and development personnel; a sales manager and sales personnel;
    a construction manager and construction superintendents;
    customer service personnel; a controller; a purchasing manager
    and office staff. We believe that division presidents and their
    management teams, who are familiar with local conditions,
    generally have better information on which to base decisions
    regarding local operations. Our division presidents receive
    performance bonuses based upon achieving targeted financial and
    operational measures in their operating divisions.



Operating
    Division Responsibilities

Each operating division is responsible for:

•

Site selection, which involves

— A feasibility study;

— Soil and environmental reviews;

— Review of existing zoning and other
    governmental requirements; and

— Review of the need for and extent of offsite
    work required to meet local building codes;

•

Negotiating lot option or similar contracts;

•

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction
    approvals;

•

Overseeing land development;

•

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes;

•

Selecting and managing construction subcontractors and suppliers;

•

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules; and

•

Developing and implementing marketing plans.

Centralized
    Controls

We centralize the key risk elements of our homebuilding business
    through our regional and corporate offices. We have four
    separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional
    office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief
    financial officer, a purchasing manager and limited office
    support staff. Each of our region presidents and their
    management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations
    of up to nine homebuilding operating divisions, including:

•

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets;

•

Review and approval of all land and lot acquisition contracts;

•

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; and

•

Review of major personnel decisions and division president
    compensation plans.

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are
    responsible for establishing our operational policies and
    internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with
    established policies and controls throughout our operations. The
    corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct
    management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through
    the following centralized functions:

•

Financing;

•

Cash management;

•

Risk and litigation management;

•

Allocation of capital;

•

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines to
    divisional homebuilding operations;

•

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions;

•

Accounting and management reporting;

•

Internal audit;

•

Information technology systems;



•

Administration of payroll and employee benefits;

•

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts;

•

Management of major national or regional supply chain
    initiatives;

•

Monitoring and analysis of margins, returns and
    expenses; and

•

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of
    results.

Cost
    Management

We control our overhead costs by centralizing certain
    administrative and accounting functions and by closely
    monitoring the number of administrative personnel and management
    positions in our operating divisions, as well as in our regional
    and corporate offices. We also minimize advertising costs by
    participating in promotional activities sponsored by local real
    estate brokers.

We control construction costs by striving to design our homes
    efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction
    materials and labor. We also negotiate favorable pricing from
    our primary subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of
    services and products we purchase from them on a local, regional
    and national basis. We monitor our construction costs on each
    house through our purchasing and construction budgeting systems,
    and we monitor our inventory levels, margins, returns and
    expenses through our management information systems.

Acquisitions

As negative market conditions in the housing industry persist,
    we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and
    maintaining strong liquidity. However, we will continue to
    evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions. We believe
    that the current housing industry downturn may provide us
    selected opportunities to enhance our operations through the
    acquisition of existing homebuilding companies at attractive
    valuations. In certain instances, such acquisitions can provide
    us benefits not found in

start-up

operations, such as: established land positions and inventories;
    and existing relationships with municipalities, land owners,
    developers, subcontractors and suppliers. We seek to limit the
    risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting
    extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each
    acquisition and by only acquiring homebuilding companies that we
    believe will have a positive impact on our earnings within an
    acceptable period of time.



Markets

We conduct our homebuilding operations in all of the geographic
    regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our
    mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our
    homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six
    reporting segments, which are comprised of the markets below.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for
    purposes of capital allocation, we consider the following local,
    market-specific factors, among others:

•

Economic conditions;

•

Job growth;

•

Median income level of potential homebuyers;

•

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products
    utilized;

•

Ability to offer homes at entry-level pricing;

•

Availability of land and lots;

•

Land entitlement and development processes;

•

New home sales activity;

•

Competition;

•

Secondary home sales activity; and

•

Prevailing housing products, features and pricing.

Land
    Policies

Typically, we acquire land after we have completed appropriate
    due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights
    (“entitlements”) to begin development or construction
    work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots.
    Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we will, among other
    things, complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests,
    independent environmental studies and other engineering work,
    and evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other
    governmental entitlements required to develop and use the
    property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop
    land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we also
    sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we
    have excess land and lot positions. In line with our current
    initiative to reduce land and lot supply to match our future
    expectations of closings, we completed a significant number of
    land and lot sales during fiscal 2008, particularly in the
    fourth quarter. In addition to generating cash flows, reducing
    our future carrying costs and land development obligations, and
    lowering our inventory supply in certain markets, consummating
    these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to
    monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a
    loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our
    expected tax refund.

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain
    the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots
    at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
    anticipated home closings or planned land development. Our
    option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our
    financial exposure to our earnest money deposited with land and
    lot sellers and any preacquisition due diligence costs incurred
    by us. This enables us to control land and lot positions with
    limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the
    risks associated with land ownership and development.

Almost all of our land and lot positions are acquired directly
    by us. We have avoided entering into joint venture arrangements
    due to their increased costs and complexity, as well as the loss
    of operational control inherent in such arrangements. We are a
    party to a very small number of joint ventures that were
    acquired through acquisitions of other homebuilders. All of
    these joint ventures are consolidated in our financial
    statements.

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory
    risks by:

•

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned)
    in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels;

•

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing
    preferences and related economic developments, such as new job
    opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income
    trends;



•

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible;

•

Limiting the size of acquired land parcels to smaller tracts,
    where possible;

•

Generally commencing construction of custom features or optional
    upgrades on homes under contract only after the buyer’s
    receipt of mortgage approval and receipt of satisfactory
    deposits from the buyer; and

•

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes
    under construction without an executed sales contract) built in
    each subdivision.

The benefits of this strategy have been limited by the current,
    deteriorating conditions in the homebuilding industry.

Construction

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets
    to appeal to local tastes and preferences of homebuyers in each
    community. We also offer optional interior and exterior features
    to allow homebuyers to enhance the basic home design and to
    allow us to generate additional revenues from each home sold. In
    some markets, we have adjusted our product offerings to address
    affordability issues, which have become increasingly important
    in the current weak market conditions.

Substantially all of our construction work is performed by
    subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are retained for a
    specific subdivision pursuant to a contract that obligates the
    subcontractor to complete construction at an

agreed-upon

price. Agreements with the subcontractors and suppliers we use
    generally are negotiated for each subdivision. We compete with
    other homebuilders for qualified subcontractors, raw materials
    and lots in the markets where we operate. We employ construction
    superintendents to monitor homes under construction, participate
    in major design and building decisions, coordinate the
    activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of
    subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor
    compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our
    construction superintendents play a significant role in working
    with our homebuyers by assisting with option selection and home
    modification decisions, educating buyers on the construction
    process and instructing buyers on post-closing home maintenance.

Construction time for our homes depends on the weather,
    availability of labor, materials and supplies, size of the home,
    and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a
    home within four to six months.

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of
    construction materials, except for work in progress materials
    for homes under construction. Generally, the construction
    materials used in our operations are readily available from
    numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with
    certain suppliers of our building materials that are cancelable
    at our option with a 30 day notice. In recent years, we
    have not experienced delays in construction due to shortages of
    materials or labor that have materially affected our
    consolidated operating results.

Marketing
    and Sales

We market and sell our homes through commissioned employees and
    independent real estate brokers. We typically conduct home sales
    from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each
    subdivision, and we typically do not offer our model homes for
    sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel
    assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor
    plans, price information, tours of model homes and assisting
    them with the selection of options and other custom features. We
    train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of
    financing, construction schedules, and marketing and advertising
    plans. As our customers are typically first-time or

move-up

homebuyers, we attempt to adjust our product mix and pricing
    within our homebuilding markets to keep our homes affordable. As
    market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers
    with one or more of a variety of incentives, including discounts
    and free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market. In
    the current weak market conditions, we have significantly
    increased the level of incentives we are offering to homebuyers
    in most markets.



We advertise in our local markets as necessary through
    newspapers, marketing brochures and newsletters. We also use
    billboards, radio and television advertising and our Internet
    website to market the location, price range and availability of
    our homes. To minimize advertising costs, we attempt to operate
    in subdivisions in conspicuous locations that permit us to take
    advantage of local traffic patterns. We also believe that model
    homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, so we
    expend significant effort to create an attractive atmosphere in
    our model homes.

In addition to using model homes, in selected markets and
    projects we build a limited number of speculative homes in each
    subdivision. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts
    to prospective homebuyers who are relocating to these markets,
    as well as to independent brokers, who often represent
    homebuyers requiring a completed home within 60 days. We
    determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on
    local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job
    relocations, housing demand, seasonality, current sales contract
    cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We
    determine the number of speculative homes to build in each
    subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace, and we
    monitor and adjust speculative homes inventory on an ongoing
    basis as conditions warrant. We typically have sold a
    substantial majority of our speculative homes while they are
    under construction or soon after completion; however, the
    significant weakness in our housing markets and related high
    cancellation rates during fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008 have caused
    our speculative homes inventory to remain higher than our target
    levels. While we plan to reduce both total and speculative homes
    in inventory from current levels, we do expect to maintain a
    level of speculative home inventory in our markets which will be
    based on our expectations of future sales and closings volume.
    We believe these speculative homes help to provide us with
    opportunities to sell additional homes, reduce our inventory of
    developed lots and generate positive cash flows.

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit of at least
    $500. The amount of earnest money required varies between
    markets and subdivisions, and may significantly exceed $500.
    Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional
    deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their
    homes. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when customers
    cancel their contracts with us, we have the right to retain
    their earnest money and option deposits; however, our operating
    divisions occasionally choose to refund such deposits. Our sales
    contracts also include a financing contingency which permits
    customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposits if
    they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified
    interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may
    include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing
    home. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of
    sales contracts in fiscal 2008 were 40%. Our cancellation rate
    continues to be significantly higher than our historical rate of
    approximately 20% before the downturn in the homebuilding
    industry, reflecting the continuing weak housing market
    conditions. The length of time between the signing of a sales
    contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer
    (closing) averages from two to six months.

Customer
    Service and Quality Control

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality
    control inspections and responding to customers’
    post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous
    response to homebuyers’ needs during and after construction
    reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for
    quality and service and ultimately leads to significant repeat
    and referral business from the real estate community and
    homebuyers. We provide our homebuyers with a limited one-year
    warranty on workmanship and building materials. The
    subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide
    us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to
    respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In
    addition, we typically provide a supplemental ten-year limited
    warranty that covers major construction defects, and some of our
    suppliers provide manufacturer’s warranties on specified
    products installed in the home.

Customer
    Mortgage Financing

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers
    of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary, DHI Mortgage. DHI Mortgage
    coordinates and expedites the sales transaction by ensuring that
    mortgage commitments are received and that closings take place
    in a timely and efficient manner. DHI Mortgage originates
    mortgage loans for a substantial portion of



our homebuyers and, when necessary to fulfill the needs of some
    homebuyers, also brokers loans to third-party lenders who
    directly originate the mortgage loans. During the year ended
    September 30, 2008, approximately 92% of DHI
    Mortgage’s loan volume related to homes closed by our
    homebuilding operations, and DHI Mortgage provided mortgage
    financing services for approximately 61% of our total homes
    closed.

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI
    Mortgage only originates loan products that it believes may be
    sold to third-party investors. DHI Mortgage generally packages
    and sells the loans and their servicing rights to third-party
    investors shortly after origination with limited recourse
    provisions. In markets where we currently do not provide
    mortgage financing, we work with a variety of mortgage lenders
    that make available to homebuyers a range of mortgage financing
    programs.

Title Services

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title
    insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance
    policies, examination and closing services to purchasers of
    homes we build and sell. We currently assume little or no
    underwriting risk associated with these title policies.

Employees

At September 30, 2008, we employed 3,800 persons, of
    whom 865 were sales and marketing personnel, 1,293 were
    executive, administrative and clerical personnel, 953 were
    involved in construction and 689 worked in mortgage and title
    operations. We had fewer than 20 employees covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. Employees of some of the
    subcontractors which we use are represented by labor unions or
    are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that
    our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.

Competition

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete in
    each of our markets with numerous other national, regional and
    local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, raw
    materials, skilled labor and financing. We also compete with
    resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market.
    Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, design,
    mortgage financing terms and location. In the current weak
    housing conditions, competition among homebuilders has greatly
    intensified, especially as to pricing and incentives, as
    builders attempt to maximize sales volume despite the weakness
    in housing demand. The current market conditions have also led
    to a large number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale,
    which has increased competition for homebuyers and affected
    pricing. Our financial services business competes with other
    mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local
    mortgage bankers and other financial institutions, some of which
    have greater access to capital, different lending criteria and
    potentially broader product offerings.

Governmental
    Regulation and Environmental Matters

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex
    regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including
    zoning, density and development requirements, building,
    environmental, advertising and real estate sales rules and
    regulations. These requirements affect the development process,
    as well as building materials to be used, building designs and
    minimum elevation of properties. Our homes are inspected by
    local authorities where required, and homes eligible for
    insurance or guarantees provided by the FHA and VA are subject
    to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad
    discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In
    addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various
    assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public
    improvements.

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to a variety of
    local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and
    regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the
    environment. The particular environmental laws for each site
    vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and
    the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties.



Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies must also
    comply with various federal and state laws and regulations.
    These include eligibility and other requirements for
    participation in the programs offered by the FHA, VA, GNMA,
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These also include required
    compliance with consumer lending and other laws and regulations
    such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions against
    discrimination and real estate settlement procedures. All of
    these laws and regulations may subject our operations to
    examination by the applicable agencies.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Prior to
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, we generally
    had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had
    greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth
    quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased
    our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations
    during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our
    funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our
    financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a
    result of seasonal activity, our results of operations and
    financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are
    not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further
    deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during the last
    two years, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our
    third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and in all quarters of
    fiscal 2008. These results were primarily due to recording
    significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges. Also, the
    increasingly challenging market conditions caused declines in
    sales volume, pricing and margins that mitigated our historical
    seasonal variations. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Discussion of our business and operations included in this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

should be read together with the risk factors set forth below.
    They describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or
    may become subject. These risks and uncertainties, together with
    other factors described elsewhere in this report, have the
    potential to affect our business, financial condition, results
    of operations, cash flows, strategies or prospects in a material
    and adverse manner.

The
    homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant downturn, and
    its duration and ultimate severity are uncertain. A continuation
    or further deterioration in industry conditions or in the
    broader economic conditions could have additional adverse
    effects on our operations and financial results.

The downturn in the homebuilding industry is in its third year
    and it has become one of the most severe housing downturns in
    U.S. history. The significant declines in the demand for
    new homes, the significant oversupply of homes on the market and
    the significant reductions in the availability of financing for
    homebuyers that have marked the downturn are continuing. We have
    experienced material reductions in our home sales and
    homebuilding revenues, and we have incurred material inventory
    and goodwill impairments and other write-offs. Our gross margins
    have declined significantly, and we incurred substantial losses
    for our 2007 and 2008 fiscal years. It is not clear when these
    trends will reverse or when we will return to profitability.

Our ability to respond to the downturn has been limited by
    adverse market and economic conditions. Recently, the growing
    number of home mortgage foreclosures has increased supply and
    driven down prices, making the purchase of a foreclosed home an
    attractive alternative to purchasing a new home. Homebuilders
    have responded to declining sales and increased cancellation
    rates with significant concessions, further adding to the price
    declines. With the decline in the values of homes and in the
    ability of homeowners to make their mortgage payments, the
    credit markets have been significantly disrupted, putting
    strains on many households and businesses. In the face of these
    conditions, fears of recession and the loss of jobs have
    increased, and consumer confidence has reached its lowest level
    in decades. As a result, the decision to buy a new home has



become more difficult, and demand for new homes has declined
    significantly. Moreover, the government’s legislative and
    administrative measures aimed at restoring liquidity to the
    credit markets and providing relief to homeowners facing
    foreclosure have only recently begun. It is unclear whether
    these measures will effectively stabilize prices and home values
    or restore confidence and increase demand in the homebuilding
    industry.

These challenging conditions are complex and interrelated. We
    cannot predict their duration or ultimate severity. Nor can we
    provide assurance that our responses to the downturn or the
    government’s attempts to address the troubles in the
    economy will be successful.

The
    downturn in homebuilding and the continuation of the disruptions
    in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital
    and increase our costs of capital.

During this downturn in the homebuilding industry, we have
    relied principally on the positive operating cash flow we have
    generated to meet our working capital needs and repay
    outstanding indebtedness. We generated $1.88 billion and
    $1.36 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal years 2008
    and 2007, respectively. We anticipate significant positive
    operating cash flow for fiscal 2009, principally through the
    receipt of federal income tax refunds and from home and land
    sales, though at a reduced level. However, the downturn and the
    disruption in the credit markets have reduced other sources of
    liquidity available to us.

In fiscal 2008, our senior debt ratings were lowered below
    investment grade by the three ratings agencies, and the terms of
    our revolving credit facility now restrict our future borrowings
    to borrowing base limitations. Though we had no cash borrowings
    outstanding under the facility at September 30, 2008, the
    borrowing base limitations currently have reduced availability
    under the facility to $52.8 million until we repay
    outstanding homebuilding debt at a faster pace than further
    inventory reductions, or the limitations are amended. We are
    currently exploring alternatives with regard to our revolving
    credit facility, which could potentially include an amendment to
    the current agreement, but consummating an amendment may be
    difficult in the current credit market. We believe that any
    amendment will require an increase in the costs of borrowing, a
    reduction in the overall credit commitment and possibly
    additional restrictions on us. We do not currently anticipate a
    need to borrow from the facility, and we plan to fund our
    short-term working capital needs and our fiscal 2009 debt
    maturities through existing cash resources and cash flows
    generated from operations during fiscal 2009.

As of September 30, 2008, we had $549.7 million of
    senior notes that mature in January and February 2009. We have
    sufficient cash on hand to make these payments. However, current
    market conditions would significantly limit our ability to
    refinance this indebtedness if we chose to do so. Pricing in the
    public debt markets has increased substantially, and the
    indenture terms available in these markets are generally more
    restrictive than those in our current indentures. Moreover, our
    senior debt ratings, the impact of our recent results on
    measures used by debt investors and the uncertainties facing the
    homebuilding industry could reduce our ability to access these
    markets even if acceptable pricing or terms are available to
    other issuers. In addition, the significant decline in our stock
    price, the ongoing volatility in the stock markets and the
    reduction in our stockholders’ equity relative to our debt
    could also impede our access to the equity markets or increase
    the amount of dilution our stockholders would experience should
    we seek to raise capital through issuance of equity.

Our financial services segment uses a $275 million mortgage
    repurchase facility to finance many of the loans it originates.
    The facility must be renewed annually, and the current facility
    expires in March 2009. A continuation of current market
    conditions could make the renewal more difficult or could result
    in an increase in the cost of the facility or a decrease in its
    committed availability. Such conditions may also make it more
    difficult or costly to sell the mortgages that we originate. We
    have reduced our mortgage products to only those we expect to be
    able to sell.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our
    cash resources, future cash flow and the sources of financing
    that we anticipate will be available to us, we can provide no
    assurance that we will continue to be able to do so,
    particularly if current market or economic conditions continue
    or deteriorate further. The future effects on our business,
    liquidity and financial results of these conditions could be
    material and adverse to us, both in ways described above and in
    other ways that we do not currently foresee.



The
    reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the increase
    in mortgage interest rates have adversely affected our business,
    and the duration and ultimate severity of the effects are
    uncertain.

Most of our customers finance their home purchases through
    lenders providing mortgage financing. Prior to the recent
    volatility in the financial markets, mortgage interest rates
    were at historical lows and a variety of mortgage products were
    available. As a result, homeownership became more accessible.
    The mortgage products available included features that allowed
    buyers to obtain financing for a significant portion, up to all,
    of the purchase price of the home, had very limited underwriting
    requirements or provided for lower initial monthly payments. As
    a result, more people were able to qualify for mortgage
    financing. Mortgage interest rates have increased, and the range
    of mortgage products to homebuyers has decreased from those
    previously available.

During fiscal 2007 and 2008, the mortgage lending industry
    experienced significant instability, beginning with increased
    defaults on subprime loans and other nonconforming loans and
    compounded by expectations of increasing interest payment
    requirements and further defaults. This in turn resulted in a
    decline in the market value of many mortgage loans and related
    securities. Lenders, regulators and others questioned the
    adequacy of lending standards and other credit requirements for
    several loan products and programs offered in recent years.
    Credit requirements tightened, and investor demand for mortgage
    loans and mortgage-backed securities declined. The deterioration
    in credit quality has caused almost all lenders to eliminate
    subprime mortgages and most other loan products that are not
    eligible for sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or loans that do
    not meet Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans
    Administration (VA) requirements. Fewer loan products, tighter
    loan qualifications and a reduced willingness of lenders to make
    loans in turn have made it more difficult for many buyers to
    finance the purchase of our homes. These factors have served to
    reduce the pool of qualified homebuyers and made it more
    difficult to sell to first time and

move-up

buyers which have long made up a substantial part of our
    customers. These reductions in demand have adversely affected
    our operations and financial results, and the duration and
    severity of the effects are uncertain.

We believe that the liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie
    Mac to the mortgage industry has been very important to the
    housing market. These entities have recently required
    substantial injections of capital from the federal government.
    These injections have been accompanied by criticism that the
    pool of homebuyers these institutions seek to assist should be
    reduced. Any reduction in the availability of the financing
    provided by these institutions could adversely affect interest
    rates, mortgage availability and our sales of new homes and
    mortgage loans.

In recent years a growing number of our homebuyers used down
    payment assistance programs, which allowed them to receive gift
    funds from non-profit corporations as a down payment.
    Homebuilders had been a source of funding for these programs.
    However, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention
    Act of 2008 eliminated seller-funded down payment assistance on
    FHA-insured loans approved on or after October 1, 2008.
    With the elimination of these gift fund programs, we will seek
    other financing alternatives, and seek down payment programs for
    those customers who meet applicable guidelines. There can be no
    assurance, however, that any such alternative programs are
    available or as attractive to our customers as the programs
    previously offered, and our sales could suffer.

Because of the decline in the availability of other mortgage
    products, FHA and VA mortgage financing support has become a
    more important factor in marketing our homes. The American
    Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, however,
    includes a provision that increases a buyer’s down payment
    from at least 3.0% to at least 3.5% of the appraised value of
    the property on FHA insured loans. This down payment requirement
    may impact the ability of our customers that meet the FHA
    guidelines to obtain financing. Additionally, this limitation
    and other limitations or restrictions on the availability of FHA
    and VA financing could adversely affect interest rates, mortgage
    availability and our sales of new homes and mortgage loans.

Even if potential customers do not need financing, changes in
    interest rates and the availability of mortgage products may
    make it harder for them to sell their current homes to potential
    buyers who need financing.



The decreases in mortgage availability have also been reflected
    in higher mortgage interest rates. Despite recent rate cuts by
    the Federal Reserve, mortgage rates remain above their lows of
    the past few years and these interest rates may increase
    further. If these rates remain high or increase, the costs of
    owning a home will be affected and could result in further
    reductions in the demand for our homes.

Our
    strategies in responding to the adverse conditions in the
    homebuilding industry have had limited success, and the
    continued implementation of these and other strategies may not
    be successful.

While we have been successful in generating positive operating
    cash flow and reducing our inventories in fiscal 2007 and 2008,
    we have done so at significantly reduced gross profit levels and
    have incurred significant asset impairment charges. These
    contributed to the net losses we recognized in fiscal 2007 and
    2008. Also, in fiscal 2007 and 2008, notwithstanding our sales
    strategies, we continued to experience an elevated rate of sales
    contract cancellations. We believe that the increase in the
    cancellation rate is largely due to a decrease in homebuyer
    confidence, due principally to continued price declines, the
    growing number of foreclosures and reduced consumer confidence.
    A more restrictive mortgage lending environment and the
    inability of some buyers to sell their existing homes have also
    impacted cancellations. Many of these factors, which affect new
    sales and cancellation rates, are beyond our control. It is
    uncertain how long the reduction in sales and the increased
    level of cancellations will continue.

The
    homebuilding industry continues to be cyclical and affected by
    changes in general economic, real estate or other business
    conditions that could adversely affect our business or financial
    results.

Cyclical Industry.

The homebuilding industry
    has been cyclical historically and continues to be significantly
    affected by changes in industry conditions, as well as in
    general and local economic conditions, such as:

•

employment levels;

•

availability of financing for homebuyers;

•

interest rates;

•

consumer confidence;

•

levels of new and existing homes for sale;

•

demographic trends; and

•

housing demand.

These may occur on a national scale, like the current downturn,
    or may affect some of the regions or markets in which we operate
    more than others. When adverse conditions affect any of our
    larger markets, they could have a proportionately greater impact
    on us than on some other homebuilding companies. Our operations
    in previously strong markets, particularly California, Florida,
    Nevada and Arizona, where we have significant inventory, have
    more adversely affected our financial results than our other
    markets in the current downturn.

An oversupply of alternatives to new homes, including foreclosed
    homes, homes held for sale by investors and speculators, other
    existing homes and rental properties, can also reduce our
    ability to sell new homes and depress new home prices and reduce
    our margins on the sales of new homes.

Inventory Risks.

Inventory risks are
    substantial for our homebuilding business. The risks inherent in
    controlling or purchasing and developing land increase as
    consumer demand for housing decreases. Thus, we may have
    acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we
    will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build
    and sell homes profitably. Our deposits for building lots
    controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk.
    The value of undeveloped land, building lots and housing
    inventories can also fluctuate significantly as a result of
    changing market conditions. In addition, inventory carrying
    costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or
    losses in a poorly performing project or market. In the



present weak market conditions, we have sold homes and land for
    lower margins or at a loss and we have recorded significant
    inventory impairment charges.

Historically, our goals for years of supply for ownership and
    control of land and building lots were based on
    management’s expectations for future volume growth. In
    light of the much weaker market conditions encountered since
    fiscal 2006, we significantly slowed our purchases of land and
    lots and made substantial land and lot sales as part of our
    strategy to reduce our inventory to better match our reduced
    rate of production. We also terminated numerous land option
    contracts and wrote off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to these option contracts. Because
    future market conditions are uncertain, we cannot provide
    assurance that these measures will be successful in managing our
    future inventory risks.

Supply Risks.

The homebuilding industry has
    from time to time experienced significant difficulties that can
    affect the cost or timing of construction, including:

•

difficulty in acquiring land suitable for residential building
    at affordable prices in locations where our potential customers
    want to live;

•

shortages of qualified trades people;

•

reliance on local subcontractors, who may be inadequately
    capitalized;

•

shortages of materials; and

•

volatile increases in the cost of materials, particularly
    increases in the price of lumber, drywall and cement, which are
    significant components of home construction costs.

Risks from Nature.

Weather conditions and
    natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes,
    wildfires, volcanic activity, droughts, and floods, can harm our
    homebuilding business. These can delay home closings, adversely
    affect the cost or availability of materials or labor, or damage
    homes under construction. The climates and geology of many of
    the states in which we operate, including California, Florida
    and Texas, where we have some of our larger operations, present
    increased risks of adverse weather or natural disaster.

Risks Related to National Security.

Continued
    military deployments in the Middle East and other overseas
    regions, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or threats to
    national security, and any corresponding response by the United
    States or others, or related domestic or international
    instability, may adversely affect general economic conditions or
    cause a slowdown of the economy.

Consequences.

As a result of the foregoing
    matters, potential customers may be less able or willing to buy
    our homes, or we may take longer or incur more costs to build
    them. Because of current market conditions, we have not been
    able to recapture any increased costs by raising prices. In the
    future, our ability to do so may also be limited by market
    conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery
    by signing home sales contracts. We may be unable to change the
    mix of our home offerings or the affordability of our homes to
    maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market
    conditions in other ways. In addition, cancellations of home
    sales contracts in backlog may increase as homebuyers cancel or
    do not honor their contracts.

Our financial services business is closely related to our
    homebuilding business, as it originates mortgage loans
    principally to purchasers of the homes we build. A decrease in
    the demand for our homes because of the foregoing matters may
    also adversely affect the financial results of this segment of
    our business. An increase in the default rate on the mortgages
    we originate may adversely affect our ability to sell the
    mortgages or the pricing we receive upon the sale of mortgages
    or may increase our repurchase obligations for previous
    originations.

Increases
    in the costs of owning a home could prevent potential customers
    from buying our homes and adversely affect our business or our
    financial results.

Significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage
    interest and real estate taxes, generally are deductible
    expenses for an individual’s federal, and in some cases
    state, income taxes, subject to various limitations under
    current tax law and policy. If the federal government or a state
    government changes its income tax laws, as has been discussed,
    to eliminate or substantially modify these income tax
    deductions, the



after-tax cost of owning a new home could increase for many of
    our potential customers. The resulting loss or reduction of
    homeowner tax deductions, if such tax law changes were enacted
    without offsetting provisions, could adversely impact demand for
    and sales prices of new homes.

In addition, increases in property tax rates by local
    governmental authorities, as experienced in response to reduced
    federal and state funding, can adversely affect the ability of
    potential customers to obtain financing or their desire to
    purchase new homes.

Governmental
    regulations could increase the cost and limit the availability
    of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect
    land development and home construction, including zoning,
    density restrictions, building design and building standards.
    These regulations often provide broad discretion to the
    administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we
    must meet prior to being approved, if approved at all. We are
    subject to determinations by these authorities as to the
    adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads or other local
    services. New housing developments may also be subject to
    various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public
    improvements. In addition, in many markets government
    authorities have implemented no growth or growth control
    initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay or increase the costs
    of development or home construction.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal
    laws and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and
    the environment. The impact of environmental laws varies
    depending upon the prior uses of the building site or adjoining
    properties and may be greater in areas with less supply where
    undeveloped land or desirable alternatives are less available.
    These matters may result in delays, may cause us to incur
    substantial compliance, remediation, mitigation and other costs,
    and can prohibit or severely restrict development and
    homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or
    areas.

Governmental
    regulation of our financial services operations could adversely
    affect our business or financial results.

Our financial services operations are subject to numerous
    federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include
    eligibility requirements for participation in federal loan
    programs, compliance with consumer lending and similar
    requirements such as disclosure requirements, prohibitions
    against discrimination and real estate settlement procedures.
    They may also subject our operations to examination by the
    applicable agencies. These factors may limit our ability to
    provide mortgage financing or title services to potential
    purchasers of our homes.

In November 2008, HUD issued a final rule modifying certain
    aspects of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The rule
    is scheduled to become effective in January 2009. As part of the
    changes, new limitations were placed on non-settlement service
    providers, such as homebuilders, from providing incentives tied
    to the use of affiliated settlement service providers. The new
    rule does not prevent settlement service providers from offering
    discounts or incentives, however this change could negatively
    impact the number of loans, closings and profitability of our
    financial services entities.

The turmoil caused by the increasing number of defaults in
    subprime and other loans has encouraged the investigation of
    financial services industry practices by governmental
    authorities. These have only recently begun, and they could
    include the examination of consumer lending practices, sales of
    mortgages to financial institutions and other investors and the
    practices in the financial services segments of homebuilding
    companies. We are unable to assess whether these governmental
    inquiries will result in changes in government regulation,
    homebuilding industry practices or adversely affect the costs or
    potential profitability of homebuilding companies.



Our
    substantial debt could adversely affect our financial
    condition.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30,
    2008, our consolidated debt was $3,748.4 million. As of
    September 30, 2008, the scheduled maturities of principal
    on our outstanding debt for the subsequent 12 months
    totaled $780.9 million.

Possible Consequences.

The amount and the
    maturities of our debt could have important consequences. For
    example, they could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payment of our debt and reduce our ability to
    use our cash flow for other purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, the
    changes in our business;

•

limit our ability to obtain future financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service
    requirements or other requirements;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt
    than some of our competitors; and

•

make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or general
    economic conditions.

Dependence on Future Performance.

Our ability
    to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend, in
    part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results
    are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this
    report. These have been compounded by the current industry and
    economic conditions. Our revenues and earnings vary with the
    level of general economic activity in the markets we serve. Our
    businesses are also affected by financial, political, business
    and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The
    factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect
    our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through
    the sale of debt or equity, the refinancing of debt, or the sale
    of assets. Changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our
    ability to meet our debt service obligations, because borrowings
    under our credit facilities bear interest at floating rates.

Credit Facility and Other Restrictions.

Our
    revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations
    and activities by requiring us to maintain certain levels of
    leverage, tangible net worth and components of inventory. If we
    do not maintain the requisite levels, we may not be able to pay
    dividends or available financing could be reduced or terminated.
    Also, in the current conditions, the margins by which we have
    met the financial covenants in our revolving credit facility
    have been reduced. If they are further reduced significantly in
    the future, we or our lenders may seek to negotiate revised
    terms for the facility that could increase the cost, reduce the
    availability or change other conditions of the facility. In
    addition, the indentures governing our senior notes and senior
    subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of
    secured debt.

The mortgage repurchase facility for our financial services
    subsidiaries also requires the maintenance of minimum levels of
    tangible net worth, ratio of debt to tangible net worth and net
    income by our financial services subsidiaries. A failure to
    comply with these requirements could allow the lending banks to
    terminate the availability of funds to the financial services
    subsidiaries or cause their debt to become due and payable prior
    to maturity.

Changes in Debt Ratings.

In fiscal 2008, all
    three of the agencies that rate our senior unsecured debt
    lowered our ratings to a level below investment grade, and two
    of the agencies lowered it even further during the year. Because
    we no longer maintain our investment grade credit ratings from
    at least two of these agencies, credit under our revolving
    credit facility is currently limited to specified percentages of
    unencumbered inventory and the amount of other senior unsecured
    indebtedness. Additionally, we are now subject to limitation on
    the number of unsold homes and the amount of developed lots and
    lots under development included in inventory. The cost of such
    capital has increased and could increase more with further
    lowering of our debt ratings. The further lowering of our debt
    ratings could also make accessing the public capital markets
    more difficult and expensive.

Change of Control Purchase Options.

If a
    change of control occurs as defined in the indentures governing
    many series of our senior and senior subordinated notes, which
    constituted $1.6 billion principal amount in the aggregate
    as of September 30, 2008, we would be required to offer to
    purchase such notes at



101% of their principal amount, together with all accrued and
    unpaid interest, if any. Moreover, a change of control as
    defined in our credit facilities may also result in the
    acceleration of our revolving credit facility or our financial
    services facility. If purchase offers were required under the
    indentures for these notes or these facilities were accelerated,
    we can give no assurance that we would have sufficient funds to
    pay the amounts that we would be required to purchase or repay.
    At September 30, 2008, we did not have sufficient funds
    available to purchase or pay all of such outstanding debt upon a
    change of control.

Impact of Financial Services Debt.

Our
    financial services business is conducted through subsidiaries
    that are not restricted by our indentures or revolving credit
    facility. The ability of our financial services subsidiaries to
    provide funds to our homebuilding operations, however, is
    subject to restrictions in their mortgage repurchase facility.
    These funds would not be available to us upon the occurrence and
    during the continuance of defaults under this facility.
    Moreover, our right to receive assets from these subsidiaries
    upon liquidation or recapitalization will be subject to the
    prior claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries. Any claims
    we may have to funds from this segment would be subordinate to
    subsidiary indebtedness to the extent of any security for such
    indebtedness and to any indebtedness otherwise recognized as
    senior to our claims.

Failure
    to comply with certain financial tests or meet ratios contained
    in our credit facilities could preclude the payment of
    dividends, impose restrictions on our business, capital
    resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect
    us.

Our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain
    financial covenants based on leverage, tangible net worth and
    components of inventory. The facility also includes a borrowing
    base requirement that is currently in effect which limits
    availability based upon certain levels of inventory and the
    amount of other senior unsecured indebtedness. If we do not
    maintain the requisite covenants, we may not be able to pay
    dividends or available financing could be terminated. The
    borrowing base limitation currently in effect limits
    availability under the facility to $52.8 million until we
    repay outstanding homebuilding debt at a faster pace than
    further inventory reductions, or the limitations are amended. In
    addition, if non-compliance with these covenants were to result
    in an event of default, the lenders could cease any further
    funding under the facility, declare any outstanding amounts due
    and payable and require us to provide cash as collateral for any
    outstanding letters of credit not already collateralized. The
    lenders could also seek to renegotiate the terms of the facility
    or impose further restrictions on our ability to pay dividends,
    obtain other financing or engage in other activities.

In addition, our mortgage subsidiary’s mortgage repurchase
    facility contains financial covenants applicable to that
    subsidiary. If our mortgage subsidiary does not comply with
    those covenants and that results in an event of default, the
    counterparties could cease further purchases under the facility
    and declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The
    counterparties could also seek to renegotiate the terms of the
    facility, and the renewal of the facility could be more
    difficult.

Homebuilding
    and financial services are very competitive, and competitive
    conditions could adversely affect our business or our financial
    results.

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders
    compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable
    properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. We
    compete with other local, regional and national homebuilders,
    often within larger subdivisions designed, planned and developed
    by such homebuilders. We also compete with existing home sales,
    foreclosures and rental properties. The competitive conditions
    in the homebuilding industry can result in:

•

lower sales;

•

lower selling prices;

•

increased selling incentives;

•

lower profit margins;

•

impairments in the value of inventory, goodwill and other assets;

•

difficulty in effecting our strategies to reduce inventory;

•

difficulty in acquiring suitable land, raw materials, and
    skilled labor at acceptable prices; or

•

delays in construction of our homes.



Our financial services business competes with other mortgage
    lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage banks
    and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders with greater
    access to capital or different lending criteria may be able to
    offer more attractive financing to potential customers.

When we are affected by these competitive conditions, our
    business and financial results could be adversely affected. In
    the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, the reactions
    of our competitors may have reduced the effectiveness of our
    efforts to achieve pricing stability and reduce our inventory
    levels.

We
    cannot make any assurances that any future growth strategies
    will be successful.

Although we focused on internal growth in recent years before
    the downturn in the homebuilding industry, we may make strategic
    acquisitions of homebuilding companies or their assets in the
    future. Successful strategic acquisitions can require the
    integration of operations and management and other efforts to
    realize the benefits that may be available. Although we believe
    that we have been successful in doing so in the past, we can
    give no assurance that we would be able to identify, acquire and
    integrate successfully strategic acquisitions in the future.
    Acquisitions can result in the dilution of existing stockholders
    if we issue our common stock as consideration or reduce our
    liquidity or increase our debt if we fund them with cash. In
    addition, acquisitions can expose us to valuation risks,
    including the risk of writing off goodwill related to such
    acquisitions based on the subsequent results of the operating
    segments to which the acquired businesses were assigned. The
    risk of write-offs related to goodwill impairment increases
    during a cyclical housing downturn when profitability of our
    operating segments may decline, as evidenced by the goodwill
    impairment charges we recognized in fiscal 2007 and 2008.
    Moreover, we may not be able to implement successfully our
    operating and any future growth strategies within our existing
    markets.

We may
    not realize our deferred income tax asset.

As of September 30, 2008, we have a deferred income tax
    asset of $213.5 million which is net of a valuation
    allowance of $961.3 million. The ultimate realization of
    the deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the taxable
    income available in current statutory carryback periods,
    reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax
    planning strategies and our ability to generate taxable income
    within the statutory carryforward periods. Based on our
    assessment, including the implementation of certain tax planning
    strategies, the realization of approximately $961.3 million
    of our deferred income tax asset is dependent upon the
    generation of future taxable income during the statutory
    carryforward periods in which the related temporary differences
    become deductible. The use of net operating loss carryforwards
    is also subject to limitations should there be more than a 50%
    change in ownership of our common stock within a three-year
    period as measured under the applicable tax regulations. The
    remaining deferred income tax asset of $213.5 million for
    which there are no valuation allowances relate to amounts that
    are expected to be primarily realized through net operating loss
    carrybacks to tax year 2007.

The accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon an
    estimate of future results, and the valuation allowance may be
    increased or decreased as conditions change or if we are unable
    to implement certain tax planning strategies. Differences
    between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax
    consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. Changes in tax laws
    could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of
    deferred income tax assets over time.

Homebuilding
    is subject to home warranty and construction defect claims in
    the ordinary course of business that can be
    significant.

As a homebuilder, we are subject to home warranty and
    construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of
    business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability
    insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from
    subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship
    and materials, and create warranty and other reserves for the
    homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and
    our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types
    of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these
    matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance
    coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will
    be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction
    defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be
    difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable
    self-insured retentions and some types of claims may not be
    covered by insurance or may exceed applicable



coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the
    availability of product liability insurance for construction
    defects is currently limited and costly. We have responded to
    increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations in recent
    years by increasing our self-insured retentions and claim
    reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be
    further restricted or become more costly.

PROPERTIES

In addition to our inventories of land, lots and homes, we own
    several office buildings totaling approximately
    213,000 square feet, and we lease approximately
    1,341,000 square feet of office space under leases expiring
    through January 2015. These properties are located in our
    various operating markets to house our homebuilding and
    financial services operating divisions and our regional and
    corporate offices.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are involved in lawsuits and other contingencies in the
    ordinary course of business. While the outcome of such
    contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe
    that the liabilities arising from these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, to the extent the
    liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any matter
    exceeds our estimates reflected in the recorded reserves
    relating to such matter, we could incur additional charges that
    could be significant.

On June 15, 2007, a putative class action,

John R.
    Yeatman, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.,

was filed
    by one of our customers against us and our affiliated mortgage
    company subsidiary in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of Georgia. The complaint sought certification
    of a class alleged to include persons who, within the year
    preceding the filing of the suit, purchased a home from us and
    obtained a mortgage for such purchase from our affiliated
    mortgage company subsidiary. The complaint alleged that we
    violated Section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
    Act by effectively requiring our homebuyers to use our
    affiliated mortgage company to finance their home purchases by
    offering certain discounts and incentives. The action sought
    damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive relief. On
    April 23, 2008, the Court ruled on our motion to dismiss
    and dismissed this complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs
    filed a notice of appeal, which is currently pending.

On March 24, 2008, a putative class action,

James
    Wilson, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.,

was filed
    by five customers of Western Pacific Housing, Inc., one of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, against us, Western Pacific Housing,
    Inc., and our affiliated mortgage company subsidiary, in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of
    California. The complaint seeks certification of a class alleged
    to include persons who, within the four years preceding the
    filing of the suit, purchased a home from us, or any of our
    subsidiaries, and obtained a mortgage for such purchase from our
    affiliated mortgage company subsidiary. The complaint alleges
    that we violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and
    Sections 16720, 17200 and 17500 of the California Business
    and Professions Code by effectively requiring our homebuyers to
    apply for a loan through our affiliated mortgage company. The
    complaint alleges that the homebuyers were either deceived about
    loan costs charged by our affiliated mortgage company or coerced
    into using our affiliated mortgage company, or both, and that
    discounts and incentives offered by us or our subsidiaries to
    buyers who obtained financing from our affiliated mortgage
    company were illusory. The action seeks treble damages in an
    unspecified amount and injunctive relief. Management believes
    the claims alleged in this action are without merit and will
    defend them vigorously. However, as the action is still in its
    early stages, we are unable to express an opinion as to the
    likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the amount of damages,
    if any. Consequently, we have not recorded any liabilities for
    damages in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

As of November 20, 2008, the closing price of our common
    stock on the NYSE was $4.52, and there were approximately 613
    holders of record.

The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of
    our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
    future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our financial
    condition and general business conditions, as well as compliance
    with covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement. We
    reduced the amount of our quarterly dividend during the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008, and we have further reduced our dividend
    amount during the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

The information required by this item with respect to equity
    compensation plans is set forth under Item 12 of this
    annual report on

Form 10-K

and is incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we did not sell any
    securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended.

In November 2007, our Board of Directors extended its
    authorization for the repurchase of up to $463.2 million of
    our common stock to November 30, 2008. We made no
    repurchases of common stock under the share repurchase program
    during fiscal 2008, and therefore, all of the
    $463.2 million authorization was remaining at
    September 30, 2008. Upon expiration of the November 2007
    authorization, our Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. The
    new authorization is effective from December 1, 2008 to
    November 30, 2009.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Results
    of Operations — Fiscal Year 2008 Overview

Our fiscal 2008 results reflect the challenges that the
    homebuilding industry faced during the year. During fiscal 2008
    the factors hurting demand for new homes became more intense and
    pervasive across the United States. As a result, the already
    difficult conditions within the industry became progressively
    more challenging. High inventory levels of both new and existing
    homes, elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates
    and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the
    year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by
    credit tightening in the mortgage markets, increasing home
    foreclosures and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial
    markets. The liquidity shortage has caused concern about the
    viability of many financial institutions and has negatively
    impacted the already weakening economy, which has created fears
    of a prolonged recession. These factors, combined with our
    continued elevated sales cancellation rate, caused our sales
    volume to be significantly reduced. Also, our gross profit from
    home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher
    levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to
    stimulate demand in our communities.

As we progressed though fiscal 2008, our disappointing sales
    results, further declines in our sales order prices, continued
    declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the
    more challenging market conditions caused our outlook for the
    homebuilding industry to remain cautious. We believe that
    housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate, and that
    the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear.
    Our outlook incorporates several factors, including continued
    margin pressure from sales price reductions and incentives;
    continued high levels of new and existing homes available for
    sale; weak demand from new home consumers; continued high sales
    cancellations; significant restrictions on the availability of
    certain mortgage products and an overall increase in the
    underwriting requirements for home financing as a result of the
    recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets.

During fiscal 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, we sold
    a significant amount of land and lots through numerous
    transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying
    costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory
    supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future
    demand. Consummating these transactions during the current
    fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our
    deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006
    resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund.

Due to the declining market conditions discussed above, we
    evaluated a significant portion of our inventory in our
    quarterly impairment analyses during fiscal 2008. Additionally,
    we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill. Our goodwill
    and inventory impairment evaluations reflected our expectation
    of continued and increasing challenges in the homebuilding
    industry, and our belief that these challenging conditions will
    persist for some time. Based on our evaluations and as a result
    of our fourth quarter land and lot sales, we recorded
    significant impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill
    balances during the year, which materially affected our
    operating results during fiscal 2008.

Strategy

We believe the long-term fundamentals which support housing
    demand, namely population growth and household formation, remain
    solid. We also believe the negative effects of the current
    market conditions, although unyielding in the near term, will
    moderate over the long term. In the interim, we remain committed
    to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy
    in the current homebuilding business environment:

•

Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by:

—

selling and constructing homes;

—

opportunistically selling excess land and lots;

—

significantly restricting our spending for land and lot
    purchases;



—

decreasing our land development spending or suspending
    development in many communities until market conditions
    improve; and

—

renegotiating or canceling land option purchase contracts.

•

Controlling our inventory of homes under construction by
    limiting the construction of unsold homes and aggressively
    marketing our unsold, completed homes in inventory.

•

Managing the sales prices and level of sales incentives on our
    homes as necessary to optimize the balance of sales volumes,
    returns and cash flows.

•

Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and
    subcontractors.

•

Continuing to modify our product offerings to provide more
    affordable homes.

•

Decreasing our SG&A infrastructure to be in line with our
    reduced expectations of production levels.

•

Reducing our level of debt by utilizing cash balances and cash
    flows from operations.

•

Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position.

These initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows
    from operations during fiscal 2007 and 2008, which we utilized
    to reduce our outstanding debt and increase our liquidity.
    Although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives
    will be successful, we expect that our operating strategy will
    allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and
    liquidity position in fiscal 2009.

Results
    of Operations — Homebuilding

Our operating segments are our 34 homebuilding operating
    divisions, which we aggregate into six reporting segments.
    Previously, we presented seven homebuilding reporting segments,
    based on our seven operating regions which had been determined
    to be our operating segments. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we reassessed the level at which the Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131 operating
    segment criteria is met, and as a result, changed our operating
    segments from the operating regions to the operating divisions.
    As a result of this change, the composition of our reporting
    segments was also revised. The California markets, which were
    previously presented as a separate reporting segment are now
    included in our West reporting segment. Additionally, the Salt
    Lake City, Utah market, which was previously included in our
    Southwest reporting segment, is now included in our West
    reporting segment. Furthermore, the name of our Northeast
    reporting segment has been changed to our East reporting
    segment, although the markets comprising it remain the same. All
    prior year segment information has been restated to conform to
    the fiscal 2008 presentation. These reporting segments, which we
    also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations
    located in the following states:

East:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

Net
    Sales Orders and Backlog

Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new
    sales contracts executed with customers, net of sales contract
    cancellations. The value of net sales orders decreased 43%, to
    $4,677.2 million (21,251 homes) in 2008 from
    $8,230.6 million (33,687 homes) in 2007. The value of net
    sales orders decreased 35%, to $852.3 million (3,977 homes)
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 from $1,309.5 million
    (6,374 homes) in the same period of fiscal 2007. The decreases
    in our net sales orders reflect the continued reduction of
    demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets. We believe
    the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of
    demand for new homes in most of our markets include a continued
    high level of new and existing homes for sale, which includes
    foreclosed homes for sale, a decrease in the availability of
    mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers which has been
    further impacted by the recent uncertainty in the financial
    markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence. Many
    prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase
    decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price
    concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and
    existing homes, concern over their ability to sell an existing
    home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty
    surrounding the housing market and weakness in the overall
    economy. We have attempted to increase sales by providing
    increased sales incentives and lowering prices, but the factors
    above, combined with the continued pricing responses of our
    competitors, have limited the impact of our pricing efforts.

Reflecting the recent significant erosion of consumer
    confidence, our sales results during the fourth quarter worsened
    at the end of the quarter. The elimination of seller-funded down
    payment assistance on FHA loans as of October 1, 2008 will
    likely have a negative effect on future sales trends as further
    discussed below. Subsequent to fiscal year 2008, the volume of
    our net sales orders for the month ended October 31, 2008
    continued the weakness experienced at the end of the fourth
    quarter and decreased 23% compared to the month ended
    October 31, 2007.

In comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007, the value of net sales
    orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions.
    These decreases were primarily due to substantially similar
    decreases in the number of homes sold in the respective region.
    Particularly in our West region, the decline in average selling
    price also contributed to the decline in the value of net sales
    orders.

The average price of our net sales orders decreased 10%, to
    $220,100 in 2008 from $244,300 in 2007. The average price of our
    net sales orders decreased significantly in our West region, and
    to a lesser extent in our Midwest and Southeast regions, due
    primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our
    California, Las Vegas, Denver and Florida markets. In general,
    our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes, and
    declines in our average selling prices during fiscal 2008 were
    due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions
    and sales incentives in order to attempt to achieve an
    appropriate sales absorption pace. Further, as the inventory of
    existing homes for sale, which includes an increasing number of
    foreclosed homes, has continued to be high, it has led to the
    need to ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable
    existing home sales prices. We monitor and may adjust our
    product mix, geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding
    markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings
    affordable for our target customer base, typically first-time
    and

move-up

homebuyers. To a lesser extent than the competitive factors
    discussed above, this has also contributed to decreases in the
    average selling price.

Our annual cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by
    gross sales orders for the period) was 40% in fiscal 2008,
    compared to 38% in fiscal 2007. Our cancellation rate in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was 47% and in the month ended
    October 31, 2008 was 41%. The higher cancellation rate
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, was primarily
    attributable to cancellations in our Southwest region,
    particularly in our Arizona markets. These elevated cancellation
    rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most of our homebuilding
    markets, including the inability of many prospective homebuyers
    to sell their existing homes, the continued erosion of buyer
    confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage
    markets. The impact of the credit tightening became apparent in
    our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 and into fiscal 2008
    as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer
    available or the buyers could no longer qualify due to stricter
    underwriting guidelines. The shortage of liquidity in the
    financial markets during fiscal 2008 has



further restricted the availability of credit. We anticipate
    that cancellation rates will remain elevated and may continue to
    fluctuate substantially until market conditions improve.

In July 2008, Congress passed and the President signed into law
    H.R. 3221, which includes the “American Housing Rescue and
    Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.” Among other
    provisions, this law eliminates seller-funded down payment
    assistance on FHA insured loans approved on or after
    October 1, 2008. Of our total home closings in fiscal 2008,
    approximately 25% were funded with mortgage loans whereby the
    homebuyer used a seller-financed down payment assistance
    program. This is a significantly higher percentage of closings
    than experienced in prior years. The use of such programs during
    fiscal 2008 was highest in our South Central and Southwest
    regions. While we will seek other down payment assistance and
    mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers, we expect the
    elimination of the seller-financed down payment assistance
    programs to have a negative impact on our future sales and
    revenues.

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet
    closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our
    sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including
    mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes,
    which can result in cancellations. Before the current housing
    downturn, our backlog had been an indicator of the level of home
    closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters; however, due to
    our current elevated cancellation rates, higher levels of unsold
    homes in inventory and difficult conditions in our markets, this
    relationship between backlog and future home closings has
    changed.

At September 30, 2008, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $1,207.4 million (5,297 homes), a decrease of
    55% from $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes) at
    September 30, 2007. The average sales price of homes in
    backlog was $227,900 at September 30, 2008, down 12% from
    the $258,000 average at September 30, 2007. The value of
    our sales order backlog decreased significantly across all of
    our market regions, reflecting the severity and geographic reach
    of the national housing downturn.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales decreased 43%, to $6,164.3 million
    (26,396 homes closed) in 2008 from $10,721.2 million
    (41,370 homes closed) in 2007. The average selling price of
    homes closed during 2008 was $233,500, down 10% from $259,200 in
    2007. During fiscal 2008, home sales revenues decreased
    significantly in all of our market regions, reflecting continued
    weak demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume
    and pricing during the year.

The number of homes closed in 2008 decreased 36% due to
    decreases in all of our market regions. As a result of the
    decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in
    our sales order backlog, we expect to close fewer homes in
    fiscal 2009 than we did in fiscal 2008. As conditions change in
    the housing markets in which we operate, our ongoing level of
    net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and
    amount of revenue we will generate.

Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were increased
    by $26.8 million and $58.0 million, respectively, from
    changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66,
    “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.” The home sales
    profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred
    in instances where a buyer finances a home through our
    wholly-owned mortgage company and has not made an adequate
    initial or continuing investment as prescribed by
    SFAS No. 66. As of September 30, 2008, the
    balance of deferred profit related to these mortgage loans held
    for sale was $5.8 million, compared to $32.6 million
    at September 30, 2007. The decline is mainly due to the
    reduced availability of the mortgage types whose use generally
    resulted in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral.

Gross profit from home sales decreased by 63%, to
    $691.2 million in 2008, from $1,848.9 million in 2007,
    and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased
    600 basis points, to 11.2%. The primary factor reducing our
    home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market
    conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our
    selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets,
    causing a decline of approximately 430 basis points in home
    sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due
    to the current sales environment in many of our markets, we have
    offered a variety of incentives and price concessions, which
    affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of
    the home or increasing



the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the
    selling price. We are also offering greater discounts and
    incentives to sell our inventory of completed homes, which is at
    a higher than desired level. This strategy helped reduce our
    completed homes in inventory, but also contributed to a decline
    in our home sales gross profit. Additionally, our home sales
    gross margin decreased approximately 210 basis points due
    to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and
    property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues, and
    10 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount
    of previously deferred gross profit during 2008 compared to
    2007. These decreases were partially offset by an improvement of
    50 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and
    construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales
    revenues.

During fiscal 2008, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized reflected our
    outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our
    business. This outlook incorporates our belief that housing
    market conditions may continue to deteriorate, and that these
    challenging conditions will persist for some time. Accordingly,
    our impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2008 again
    indicated a significant number of communities with impairment
    indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of
    $2,186.2 million as of September 30, 2008, had
    indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for
    impairment. The analysis of each of these communities generally
    assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or
    lower than current sales order prices in each community or for
    comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable
    absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe
    for a given community in the current market conditions, we
    estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from
    six months to in excess of ten years. Through this evaluation
    process, we determined that communities with a carrying value of
    $967.8 million as of September 30, 2008, the largest
    portions of which were in the West and Southeast regions, were
    impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    we recorded impairment charges of $364.7 million to reduce
    the carrying value of the impaired communities to their
    estimated fair value.

Due to the significant decline in demand for new homes, we have
    reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes, as well
    as our expected need for land and lots in the future.
    Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold
    a significant amount of land and lots. In connection with these
    land and lot sales, we recorded impairment charges of
    $624.2 million to reduce the $814.4 million carrying
    value of this inventory to its net realizable value. Including
    impairments related to land sales, impairment charges during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled $988.9 million, as
    compared to $278.3 million in the prior year period. The
    fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded
    earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment
    charges of $2,372.6 million and $1,222.2 million
    during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. We perform our
    impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community
    level. When an impairment charge for a community is determined,
    the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the
    same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each
    lot. The inventory within each community is categorized as
    construction in progress and finished homes, residential land
    and lots — developed and under development, and land
    held for development, based on the stage of production or plans
    for future development. During fiscal 2008, excluding
    impairments related to land sales, approximately 79% of the
    impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots
    and land held for development, and approximately 21% of the
    charges were recorded to residential construction in progress
    and finished homes inventory, compared to 74% and 26%,
    respectively, in fiscal 2007.

Of the remaining $1,218.4 million of projects with
    impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired
    at September 30, 2008, the largest concentrations were in
    Florida (18%), Texas (13%) and California (12%). It is possible
    that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these
    communities may change and could result in a future need to
    record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair
    value. Additionally, if conditions in the broader economy,
    homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate
    worsen beyond current expectations, and as we re-evaluate
    specific community pricing and incentives and our land sale
    strategies, we may be required to evaluate additional
    communities or re-evaluate previously impaired communities for
    potential impairment. These evaluations may result in additional
    impairment charges, which could be material.

Based on a quarterly review of land and lot option contracts, we
    have written off earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
    costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no
    longer plan to pursue. During



fiscal 2008 and 2007, we wrote off $111.9 million and
    $107.3 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts.
    Should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist
    and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land
    purchase contracts, we may write off additional earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs.

The inventory impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding
    gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by
    approximately 3,810 basis points in fiscal 2008, compared
    to 1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007.

Land
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Land sales revenues decreased 4% to $354.3 million in 2008,
    from $367.6 million in 2007. The gross profit percentage
    from land sales decreased to 8.5% in 2008, from 22.9% in 2007.
    Due to the significant decline in demand for new homes, we have
    reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes, as well
    as our expected need for land and lots in the future.
    Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold
    a significant amount of land and lots through numerous
    transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying
    costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory
    supply in certain markets. Consummating these transactions
    during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger
    portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to
    fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund.
    The terms of certain of these land and lot sales, primarily
    related to our continuing involvement with the properties,
    resulted in the deferral of the recognition of the sale
    transaction in some cases. Consequently, $21.7 million of
    inventory, reflecting its current fair value, is recorded as a
    component of inventory not owned. In markets where we own more
    land and lots than our expected needs in the next few years, we
    plan to attempt to sell these excess lots and land parcels. As
    of September 30, 2008, we had $39.4 million of land
    held for sale which we expect to sell in the next 12 months.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities decreased by
    $349.7 million, or 31%, to $791.8 million in 2008 from
    $1,141.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues, SG&A expense increased 180 basis points, to
    12.1% in 2008 from 10.3% in 2007, due to a decrease in revenues.
    The largest component of our homebuilding SG&A expense is
    employee compensation and related costs, which represented 53%
    and 59% of SG&A costs in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Those
    costs decreased $254.2 million, or 38%, to
    $417.9 million in 2008 from $672.2 million in 2007,
    largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of
    employees to match our current and anticipated home closing
    levels, as well as a decrease in incentive compensation, which
    is primarily based on profitability. Our homebuilding operations
    employed approximately 3,100 and 5,100 employees at
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We continue to adjust our SG&A infrastructure to support
    our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make assurances
    that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the
    current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues. It may
    become more difficult to reduce SG&A expense as the size of
    our operations decreases. If revenues continue to decrease and
    we are unable to sufficiently adjust our SG&A, future
    SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues may increase
    further.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during
    development and construction. During fiscal 2007, our inventory
    eligible for interest capitalization (“active
    inventory”) exceeded our debt levels; therefore, we
    capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. However, due to
    our inventory reduction strategies, slowing or suspending land
    development in certain communities and limiting the construction
    of unsold homes, our active inventory has been lower than our
    debt level in recent quarters. As a result, we expensed
    $39.0 million of interest incurred during fiscal 2008.

Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written
    off with inventory impairment charges, was 3.9% of total home
    and land/lot cost of sales in 2008, compared to 2.4% in 2007.
    The increase in the rate of interest amortized to cost of sales
    was primarily due to a greater decline in our home closings
    volume as



compared to the decline in our interest incurred during the
    year, and a more rapid reduction in our active inventory levels
    than our interest incurred over the time period in which fiscal
    2008 closings were active versus the prior year closings.

Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of
    our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007, interest incurred related to
    homebuilding debt decreased by 22%, to $236.7 million,
    primarily due to a 23% decrease in our average homebuilding debt.

Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

In fiscal 2008, we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt
    of $2.6 million, which was primarily due to the write-off
    of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our
    revolving credit facility in June 2008. In fiscal 2007, in
    connection with the early retirement of our 8.5% senior
    notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of $12.1 million for the
    call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to
    the redeemed notes.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $9.1 million in 2008, compared
    to $4.0 million in 2007. The increase in other income in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in interest income.

Goodwill

In performing our annual impairment analysis as of
    September 30, 2008, we estimated the fair value of our
    operating segments utilizing the expected present values of
    future cash flows. As a result of this analysis, we determined
    that the goodwill balance related to each operating segment in
    our Southwest reporting region was impaired. Consequently,
    during the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment
    charge of $79.4 million.

As of September 30, 2008, our remaining goodwill balance
    was $15.9 million, all of which related to our South
    Central reporting segment. As of September 30, 2007,
    allocation of our remaining goodwill balance of
    $95.3 million was as follows: South Central
    $15.9 million and Southwest $79.4 million.

The goodwill assessment procedures of SFAS No. 142
    require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues
    and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such
    estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.

Income
    Taxes

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
    requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax
    assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not
    be realized. Accordingly, we periodically assess the need to
    establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on
    the SFAS No. 109 more-likely-than-not realization
    threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation
    allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive
    and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred
    tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the
    taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods;
    reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; tax
    planning strategies; the nature, frequency and severity of
    current and cumulative losses; the duration of statutory
    carryforward periods; our historical experience in generating
    operating profits; and expectations for future profitability. In
    making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence
    that can be objectively verified. SFAS No. 109
    provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant
    negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are
    realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on
    projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of
    deferred tax assets.

Due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding
    industry during the past two years, we have recorded significant
    impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill, and are in a
    three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position for fiscal years
    2006 through 2008. While we have a long history of profitable



operations prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding
    industry, the expected cumulative loss position is significant
    negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of our
    deferred tax assets. Therefore, we recorded a valuation
    allowance on our deferred tax assets, representing those
    deferred tax asset amounts for which ultimate realization is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which the related temporary differences become
    deductible. The remaining deferred tax assets of
    $213.5 million for which there are no valuation allowances
    relate to amounts that are expected to be primarily realized
    through net operating loss carrybacks to tax year 2007.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of
    future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual
    outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material
    impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
    position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual
    tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.

During fiscal 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, we sold
    a significant amount of land and lots through numerous
    transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying
    costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory
    supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future
    demand. These transactions, combined with the results of all of
    our operations in this difficult housing environment, generated
    a net operating tax loss that can be carried back to fiscal 2006
    and will result in a federal income tax refund. Consequently, we
    recorded a $676.2 million federal income tax receivable
    relating to the net operating loss carryback refund claim at
    September 30, 2008.

On October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
    disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken on a tax return, including the minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 had no impact on our beginning
    retained earnings. Effective with our adoption of FIN 48,
    interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are
    recognized in the financial statements as a component of the
    income tax provision. Interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits were previously included in interest
    expense and in selling, general and administrative expense,
    respectively. During fiscal 2008, we recognized interest and
    penalties of $4.0 million in our consolidated statement of
    operations, and at September 30, 2008, our total accrued
    interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax
    benefits was $4.9 million. As of September 30, our
    total unrecognized income tax benefits were $18.7 million.
    All tax positions, if recognized, would affect our effective
    income tax rate. We do not expect the total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase
    within twelve months of the current reporting date.

We are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in
    multiple states. The Internal Revenue Service is currently
    examining our fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and we are being
    audited by various states. The statute of limitations for our
    major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal
    years 2004 through 2008.

In fiscal 2008, the provision for income taxes was
    $1.8 million, which reflects the effect of the
    establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In
    fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was
    $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income
    taxes for the year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008
    differs from the statutory rate, primarily because of the
    establishment of the valuation allowance as discussed above.

Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    46% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 44% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $332.5 million in 2008, compared to
    a loss of $66.1 million in 2007. The losses were primarily
    due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $288.4 million and
    $81.5 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. In
    fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included
    $42.7 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land
    sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of
    $39.4 million also contributed to the loss. A



decrease in the region’s gross profit from home sales as a
    percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit
    percentage) of 930 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007
    also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes.
    The home sales gross profit percentage declined in most of the
    region’s markets, many of which have had very high sales
    cancellations resulting in unsold homes we aggressively priced
    to sell. Despite implementing significant cost control measures,
    our revenues declined at a greater rate (46%) than our SG&A
    expense (29%), which also contributed to the loss before income
    taxes in this region.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 51% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 46%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 7% decrease
    in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported
    a loss before income taxes of $184.3 million in 2008,
    compared to a loss of $205.3 million in 2007. The losses
    were primarily due to a decline in revenues and inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs totaling $163.3 million and $167.3 million
    in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, while the region’s
    home sales gross profit percentage remained relatively flat. In
    fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included
    $33.6 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land
    sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of
    $48.5 million also contributed to the loss. Despite
    implementing significant cost control measures, our revenues
    declined at a greater rate (51%) than our SG&A expense
    (31%), which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in
    this region.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 44% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 41%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 9% decrease
    in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported
    a loss before income taxes of $507.7 million in 2008,
    compared to a loss of $131.6 million in 2007. The losses
    were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $457.5 million and $210.2 million in fiscal 2008 and
    2007, respectively. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges
    included $116.7 million of impairments related to fourth
    quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges
    of $11.5 million also contributed to the loss. A decrease
    in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage of
    990 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed
    to the increase in loss before income taxes. The home sales
    gross profit percentage declines in our Florida markets had the
    greatest impact on the overall decreases. The Florida markets
    experienced rapid price increases in previous years which
    encouraged speculation in residential real estate, creating an
    environment that has shown not to be sustainable. The tightening
    in the mortgage environment, high cancellation rates and
    existing homes for sale by investors have led to increased
    inventory levels, requiring price reductions and increased
    levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of
    qualified buyers, resulting in substantial gross profit declines.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 28% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 29% decrease in
    the number of homes closed. The region reported a loss before
    income taxes of $9.0 million in 2008, compared to income
    before income taxes of $122.2 million in 2007. The loss in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges
    and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $72.4 million in fiscal 2008, compared to
    $24.6 million in 2007. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment
    charges included $29.1 million of impairments related to
    fourth quarter land sales. In addition, the region’s home
    sales gross profit percentage decreased 130 basis points in
    2008 compared to 2007. The decline in home sales gross profit
    was largely due to softening in the San Antonio market,
    where inventories of new and existing homes have increased,
    resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered
    by builders. The majority of the region’s inventory
    impairment charges were also in the San Antonio market.

Southwest Region

    decreased 38% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 35% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, as well as an 11% decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $366.7 million in 2008, compared to
    income before income taxes of $192.9 million in 2007. The
    loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment
    charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs
    totaling $330.7 million, compared to $26.8 million in
    2007. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included
    $155.4 million of impairments related to fourth quarter
    land sales. A decrease in the region’s home sales gross
    profit percentage of 720 basis points in 2008 compared to
    2007, which was largely due to declines in our Phoenix market,
    also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes.
    The Phoenix market experienced rapid price increases in previous
    years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate,
    creating an environment that has shown



not to be sustainable. The tightening in the mortgage
    environment, high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale
    by investors have led to increased inventory levels, requiring
    price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to
    compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers, resulting in
    substantial gross profit declines. The increased number of
    foreclosed homes being offered for sale in Phoenix has added
    further pressure to sales prices. In fiscal 2008, goodwill
    impairment charges of $79.4 million also contributed to the
    loss.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    45% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 36% decrease in the
    number of homes closed, as well as a 17% decrease in the average
    selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before
    income taxes of $1.3 billion in 2008, compared to a loss of
    $932.1 million in 2007. The losses were primarily due to
    inventory impairment charges and earnest money and
    pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling $1.2 billion and
    $819.1 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our
    California and Las Vegas markets. In fiscal 2008, inventory
    impairment charges included $246.7 million of impairments
    related to fourth quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill
    impairment charges of $374.7 million also contributed to
    the loss. A decrease in the region’s home sales gross
    profit percentage of 920 basis points in 2008 compared to
    2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income
    taxes. Although all of the region’s markets have
    experienced weak market conditions, the home sales gross profit
    percentage decline in our California and Las Vegas markets had
    the greatest impact on the overall decreases for the region. The
    California and Las Vegas markets experienced rapid, significant
    home price increases in previous years which contributed to
    gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross
    profits in 2006, but these price increases also strained housing
    affordability for many potential homebuyers there. Credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets has also significantly
    limited the availability of many mortgage products used
    extensively by California and Las Vegas homebuyers in previous
    years. Increased levels of sales incentives and home price
    reductions have been typical in these markets, as builders have
    attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory
    levels and to address affordability concerns, resulting in
    substantial gross profit declines. The increased number of
    foreclosed homes being offered for sale in California and Las
    Vegas has added further pressure to sales prices.

Net
    Sales Orders and Backlog

The value of net sales orders decreased 41%, to
    $8,230.6 million (33,687 homes) in 2007 from
    $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006, reflecting the
    continued softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding
    markets. Factors that contributed to the slowing of demand
    included an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a
    reduction in investor purchases, an increase in incentives
    offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes, a
    decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many
    potential homebuyers and a decline in homebuyer consumer
    confidence.

In comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, the value of net sales
    orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions.
    These decreases were primarily due to substantially similar
    decreases in the number of homes sold in each region, although
    in our Southeast, Southwest and West regions, a decline in
    average selling prices was also a significant factor. The most
    significant decline in net sales orders occurred in our West
    region, with 43% fewer homes sold in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal
    2006. We believe that home sales in our California markets were
    negatively impacted, to a greater extent than our other markets,
    by a reduction in the pool of qualified buyers due to a lack of
    housing affordability and the decline of mortgage availability.

The average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was
    $244,300, a decrease of 9% from the $267,300 average in fiscal
    2006. The average price of our net sales orders decreased
    significantly in our Southeast, Southwest and West regions, due
    primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our
    Florida, Arizona and California markets. In general, our pricing
    is dependent on the demand for our homes, and declines in our
    average selling prices during the year were due in large part to
    increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives.
    Further, as the inventory of existing homes for sale continued
    to rise, it led to the need to ensure that our pricing was
    competitive with comparable existing home sales prices. As part
    of our efforts to keep our core product offerings affordable for
    our target customer base, adjustments to our product and
    geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets also
    contributed to decreases in the average selling price.

Our annual cancellation rate was 38% in fiscal 2007, compared to
    28% in fiscal 2006. The higher overall cancellation rate for
    fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many
    of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. These elevated
    cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most
    homebuilding markets, including the inability of many
    prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes, the
    increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions
    in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further
    credit tightening in the mortgage markets. The impact of the
    credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in
    late fiscal 2007 as the mortgage products many buyers had
    selected were no longer available or they could not qualify due
    to stricter underwriting guidelines.



At September 30, 2007, the value of our backlog of sales
    orders was $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes), a decrease of
    48% from $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes) at
    September 30, 2006. The average sales price of homes in
    backlog was $258,000 at September 30, 2007, down 10% from
    the $286,100 average at September 30, 2006. The value of
    our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our
    market regions.

Home
    Sales Revenue and Gross Profit

Revenues from home sales decreased 26%, to
    $10,721.2 million (41,370 homes closed) in 2007 from
    $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006. Revenues
    from home sales decreased in all six of our market regions, led
    by the Midwest and West regions, with decreases of 41% and 36%,
    respectively. The number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22%
    and the average selling price of those homes decreased 5%. These
    decreases were the result of slowing demand and the resulting
    decline in net sales order volume and pricing during fiscal 2007.

Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased
    by $58.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from
    changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66. As
    of September 30, 2007, the balance of deferred profit was
    $32.6 million, compared to $90.6 million at
    September 30, 2006. The decline was attributable to both
    the drop in the number of homes closed and a decline in the
    availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted
    in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral.

Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82%, to
    $603.7 million in 2007 from $3,342.2 million in 2006.
    Including sales of both homes and land/lots, as well as
    impairment charges and land option cost write-offs, total
    homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues decreased 1,720 basis points, to 5.4% in 2007 from
    22.6% in 2006. Approximately 1,020 basis points of the
    decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges
    and land option cost write-offs. As a percentage of homebuilding
    revenues, these were 12.0% in fiscal 2007 versus 1.8% in fiscal
    2006.

Gross profit from home sales decreased by 47%, to
    $1,848.9 million in 2007, from $3,497.6 million in
    2006, and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased
    680 basis points, to 17.2%. The primary factor reducing our
    home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market
    conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our
    selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets,
    causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home
    sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due
    to declining sales in many of our markets, we offered a variety
    of incentives and price concessions, which affected our gross
    profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or
    increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase
    in the selling price. We also offered greater discounts and
    incentives to sell our inventory of homes, which was at a higher
    than desired level. This strategy helped reduce our total homes
    in inventory by approximately 8,600 units during fiscal
    2007, but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross
    profit. Additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased
    approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the
    amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points
    due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses
    as a percentage of home sales revenues. These decreases were
    partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of
    20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the
    relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets,
    and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of
    $58.0 million of previously deferred gross profit during
    2007, compared to $1.6 million in 2006.

During fiscal 2007, the difficult conditions within the
    homebuilding industry became more challenging. High inventory
    levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation
    rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and
    overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year.
    The effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline
    in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage
    interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit
    tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with
    our disappointing sales results, further declines in sales order
    prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales
    revenues throughout the year, caused our outlook for the
    homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become
    more cautious as the year progressed.

During fiscal 2007, when we performed our quarterly inventory
    impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized incorporated our
    outlook, which reflected the expectation that the challenging
    conditions in the homebuilding industry would persist and have a
    greater impact than we believed when the year began.



Consequently, our strategy to reduce our inventory and lot
    position in a number of markets would likely take longer and
    require additional price concessions and incentives than
    previously anticipated. Therefore, our impairment evaluations
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant
    number of projects with impairment indicators. Communities with
    a combined carrying value of $2,622.4 million as of
    September 30, 2007, had indicators of potential impairment
    and were evaluated for impairment. The analysis of each of these
    projects generally assumed that sales prices in future periods
    will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in
    each project or for comparable projects in order to generate an
    acceptable absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a
    timeframe for a given project in the current market conditions,
    we estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from
    six months to in excess of ten years. Through these evaluations,
    we determined that projects with a carrying value of
    $940.5 million as of September 30, 2007, the largest
    portions of which were in the West and Southeast regions, were
    impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007,
    we recorded impairment charges totaling $278.3 million to
    reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their
    estimated fair value. These fourth quarter charges combined with
    impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in
    total inventory impairment charges of $1,222.2 million
    during fiscal 2007. Approximately 74% of these impairment
    charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held
    for development, and approximately 26% of these charges were
    recorded to residential construction in progress and finished
    homes in inventory. During fiscal 2006, we recorded impairment
    charges totaling $146.2 million related to projects with a
    carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which
    were in California. Of the remaining $1,681.9 million of
    projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to
    be impaired at September 30, 2007, the largest
    concentrations were in California (28%), Florida (20%), and
    Arizona (16%).

During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we wrote off $107.3 million
    and $124.7 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits
    and pre-acquisition costs related to land option purchase
    contracts which we determined we would not pursue. The inventory
    impairment charges and write-offs of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as
    a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately
    1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007, compared to
    180 basis points in fiscal 2006.

Selling,
    General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense

SG&A expense from homebuilding activities decreased by
    $315.1 million, or 22%, to $1,141.5 million in 2007
    from $1,456.6 million in 2006. As a percentage of
    homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense increased 40 basis
    points, to 10.3% in 2007 from 9.9% in 2006, due to a decrease in
    revenues. The largest component of our homebuilding SG&A
    expense is employee compensation and related costs, which
    represented 59% and 64% of SG&A costs in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Those costs decreased $260.2 million, or 28%,
    to $672.2 million in 2007 from $932.4 million in 2006,
    largely due to our efforts to align the number of employees to
    match our home closing levels, as well as a decrease in
    incentive compensation, which is primarily based on
    profitability. Our homebuilding operations employed
    approximately 5,100 and 7,100 employees at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining
    decrease in SG&A expense of $54.9 million was
    primarily attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance,
    advertising costs and professional consulting fees.

Interest
    Incurred

We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during
    development and construction. During both fiscal years, our
    active inventory exceeded our debt levels; therefore, we
    capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. Interest
    amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written off with
    inventory impairment charges, was 2.4% of total home and
    land/lot cost of sales in 2007, compared to 2.1% in 2006.

Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of
    our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006, interest incurred related to
    homebuilding debt decreased by 6%, to $304.3 million,
    primarily due to a 5% decrease in our average homebuilding debt.



Loss
    on Early Retirement of Debt

In fiscal 2007, in connection with the early retirement of our
    8.5% senior notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of
    approximately $12.1 million for the call premium and the
    unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. In
    fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our
    9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our
    10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a
    loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium
    and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized
    premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded
    a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the
    unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement
    of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006.

Other
    Income

Other income, net of other expenses, associated with
    homebuilding activities was $4.0 million in 2007, compared
    to $11.0 million in 2006. Major components of other income
    in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of
    assets, while in fiscal 2006, the increase in the fair value of
    our interest rate swaps was also a major component.

Goodwill

At June 30, 2007, we determined that an interim test to
    assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of
    the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under
    SFAS No. 144, the market conditions in the
    homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price. We
    completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as
    of June 30, 2007, and concluded an impairment loss was
    probable and could be reasonably estimated for our East,
    Southeast and West reporting segments. As a result, during the
    quarter ended June 30, 2007, we recorded goodwill
    impairment charges totaling $425.6 million.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we completed
    the second step of our goodwill impairment analysis, through
    which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter
    write-offs and determined that the goodwill balance related to
    our Midwest reporting segment was completely impaired.
    Consequently, the goodwill balance in our Midwest reporting
    segment of $48.5 million, which included $13.5 million
    transferred from the Southwest reporting segment due to changing
    our management structure, was written off in the fourth quarter.
    Total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were
    $474.1 million.

In addition, at September 30, 2007, we completed our annual
    impairment test and determined that the fair values of our South
    Central and Southwest reporting segments were greater than their
    carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those
    segments.

Our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Prior year
    amounts have been restated between reporting segments as
    appropriate, to conform to the 2008 presentation.

Income
    Taxes

In fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was
    $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income
    taxes for the year. In fiscal 2006, the provision for income
    taxes was $753.8 million, corresponding to the income
    before income taxes for the year.

Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 25.1%,
    compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% in fiscal 2006. The
    effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax
    rate in 2006, resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes
    related to the loss in the year, because only approximately 23%
    of the $474.1 million goodwill impairment charge recorded
    in fiscal 2007 was deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the
    goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 40.9% for
    fiscal 2007.

Primarily as a result of recording significant inventory
    impairment charges during fiscal 2007, the balance of our
    deferred tax asset increased substantially, from
    $374.0 million at September 30, 2006 to
    $863.8 million at September 30, 2007.

Homebuilding
    Results by Reporting Region

East Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    22% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 22% decrease in
    the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $66.1 million in 2007, compared to
    income of $112.9 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007
    was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $81.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $39.4 million. A decrease in the region’s gross profit
    from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home
    sales gross profit percentage) of 450 basis points in 2007
    compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income
    before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage
    decline in our South Carolina and New Jersey markets had the
    greatest impact on the overall decrease in the region’s
    profitability.

Midwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 42%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a
    slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. The
    region reported a loss before income taxes of
    $205.3 million in 2007, compared to income of
    $111.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was
    primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money
    and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $167.3 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $48.5 million. The majority of the inventory impairments
    relate to projects in our Denver market. A decrease in the
    region’s home sales gross profit percentage of
    210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006, as well as an
    increase in construction defect expense in Denver, also
    contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes.

Southeast Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 28% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 24%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 6% decrease
    in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported
    a loss before income taxes of $131.6 million in 2007,
    compared to income of $346.4 million in 2006. The loss in
    fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges
    and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $210.2 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $11.5 million. A decrease in the region’s home sales
    gross profit percentage of 1,140 basis points in 2007
    compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income
    before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage
    decline in our Florida markets had the greatest impact on the
    overall decrease. The Florida markets experienced rapid price
    increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit
    increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006.
    In 2007, high inventory levels of new and existing homes and
    increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions
    were typical throughout Florida, resulting in substantial gross
    profit declines.

South Central Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    decreased 13% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 16%
    decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a 5%
    increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income
    before income taxes for the region was $122.2 million in
    2007, down 29% from 2006. Income before income taxes as a
    percentage of the region’s revenues (operating margin)
    decreased 130 basis points, to 6.1%, from 7.4% in 2006. The
    decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to



a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The
    home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening in
    the San Antonio market, where inventories of new and
    existing homes increased, resulting in increased levels of sales
    incentives being offered by builders. The recording of inventory
    impairment charges and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost
    write-offs totaling $24.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared
    to $2.2 million in 2006, also contributed to the decline in
    the region’s profitability.

Southwest Region

— Homebuilding revenues
    remained relatively flat, decreasing only 1% in 2007 compared to
    2006, due to a 7% decrease in the average selling price of homes
    closed, partially offset by a 4% increase in the number of homes
    closed. Income before income taxes for the region was
    $192.9 million in 2007, down 54% from 2006. Operating
    margin decreased 1,160 basis points, to 10.2%, from 21.8%
    in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily
    due to a decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit
    percentage of 1,130 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006.
    The home sales gross profit change was largely due to declines
    in our Phoenix market. The Phoenix market experienced
    significant price increases in previous years which contributed
    to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross
    profit in 2006. In 2007, higher inventory levels of new and
    existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price
    reductions were more common in Phoenix, resulting in gross
    profit declines. The recording of inventory impairment charges
    and earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $26.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $4.8 million
    in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the region’s
    profitability.

West Region

— Homebuilding revenues decreased
    34% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 34% decrease in the
    number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the
    average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss
    before income taxes of $932.1 million in 2007, compared to
    income of $720.6 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007
    was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest
    money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs totaling
    $819.1 million, and goodwill impairment charges of
    $374.7 million. The majority of the inventory impairments
    relate to projects in our California and Las Vegas markets. A
    decrease in the region’s home sales gross profit percentage
    of 790 basis points in 2007, compared to 2006 also
    contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The
    home sales gross profit percentage declines in our California
    and Las Vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall
    decrease. The California and Las Vegas markets experienced
    rapid, significant home price increases in previous years which
    contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued
    elevated gross profit in 2006, but these price increases also
    strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers in
    those markets. Credit tightening in the mortgage markets also
    significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products
    used extensively by California and Las Vegas homebuyers in the
    previous years. In 2006 and 2007, inventory levels of new and
    existing homes in these markets were high and increased levels
    of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in
    new home communities, as builders attempted to increase demand
    for homes and address affordability concerns, resulting in gross
    profit declines.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage
    operations is directly related to the number and value of homes
    closed by our homebuilding operations. Total first-lien loans
    originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers
    decreased by 41% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007,
    corresponding to



the decrease in the number of homes closed of 36%. The
    percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the
    percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our
    mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by
    our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the
    homebuyers’ financing), to 61% in 2008, from 66% in 2007,
    as DHI Mortgage reduced the number of homebuilding markets it
    supports. Home closings from our homebuilding operations
    constituted 92% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2008,
    compared to 95% in 2007, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s
    continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by
    our homebuilding operations. The number of loans sold to
    third-party investors decreased by 50% in 2008 as compared to
    2007. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the
    number of mortgage loans originated.

Consistent with the second half of fiscal 2007, originations
    during fiscal 2008 continued to be predominantly traditional
    conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured loans.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 39%, to
    $127.5 million in 2008 from $207.7 million in 2007.
    The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of
    mortgage loans originated and sold, although during fiscal 2008,
    the effect of decreased loan volume was partially offset by the
    recognition of an additional $8.8 million of revenues
    related to the adoption of Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 109, “Written Loan Commitments
    Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings”
    (SAB 109) on January 1, 2008. SAB 109
    requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement
    of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair
    value through earnings at the time of commitment. Additionally,
    we increased our loan loss reserve from $24.6 million at
    September 30, 2007, to $30.5 million at
    September 30, 2008 to provide for estimated losses
    predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for
    sale. Charges related to recourse obligations declined to
    $21.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $26.0 million in
    fiscal 2007. Recourse expense is included as a component of
    gains from sale of mortgages.

General and administrative (G&A) expense associated with
    financial services decreased 35%, to $100.1 million in 2008
    from $153.8 million in 2007. The largest component of our
    financial services G&A expense is employee compensation and
    related costs, which represented 71% and 75% of G&A costs
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Those costs decreased 38%, to
    $70.8 million in 2008 from $114.9 million in 2007, as
    we have continued to align the number of employees with current
    and anticipated loan origination and title service levels. Our
    financial services operations employed approximately 700 and
    1,100 employees at September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense
    increased by 450 basis points, to 78.5% in 2008, from 74.0%
    in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in
    revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume
    during fiscal 2008, and was partially offset by the effect of
    the additional revenue recognized upon adopting SAB 109 in
    fiscal 2008. Fluctuations in financial services G&A expense
    as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to
    changes in the amount of revenue earned, as some expenses are
    not directly related to mortgage loan volume.

Interest expense is directly related to the average level of our
    financial services debt outstanding during the period. Comparing
    fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007, interest expense related to
    financial services debt decreased by 84%, to $3.7 million,
    primarily due to an 87% decrease in our average financial
    services debt.

Interest and other income decreased 70%, to $11.4 million
    in 2008 from $38.5 million in 2007, primarily due to the
    decreased volume of loan originations.

Mortgage
    Loan Activity

Total first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage
    for our homebuyers decreased by 24% in fiscal 2007 compared to
    fiscal 2006, corresponding to the decrease in the number of
    homes closed of 22%. The percentage decrease in loans originated
    was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to
    a decline in our mortgage capture rate to 66% in 2007, from 68%
    in 2006. Home closings from our homebuilding operations
    constituted 95% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2007,
    compared to 94% in



2006, reflecting DHI Mortgage’s continued focus on
    supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding
    operations. The number of loans sold to third-party investors
    decreased by 29% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was
    primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans
    originated.

During fiscal 2007, the market for certain non-traditional
    mortgage loans changed substantially, resulting in the reduced
    availability of some loan products that had previously been
    available to borrowers. The affected loan products were
    generally characterized by high combined loan-to-value ratios in
    combination with less required documentation than traditional
    mortgage loans. Such loans constituted approximately half of our
    total originations during fiscal 2006, but these products
    declined substantially as a percentage of total originations
    during fiscal 2007, primarily in the third and fourth quarters.
    As a percentage of total loans originated, originations of
    traditional conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured
    loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, to approximately 90%, corresponding to the
    reduction in non-traditional mortgage loans.

Financial
    Services Revenues and Expenses

Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29%, to
    $207.7 million in 2007 from $290.8 million in 2006.
    The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of
    mortgage loans originated and sold. Additionally, we increased
    our loan loss reserve from $15.6 million at
    September 30, 2006, to $24.6 million at
    September 30, 2007 to provide for estimated losses
    predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for
    sale. The increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding
    decrease to the gains on sale of mortgages, and reflects the
    market conditions related to non-traditional products as
    described above, as well as potential repurchase obligations
    that exist on certain loans previously sold.

G&A expense associated with financial services decreased
    24%, to $153.8 million in 2007 from $202.2 million in
    2006. The largest component of our financial services G&A
    expense is employee compensation and related costs, which
    represented 75% and 77% of G&A costs in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Those costs decreased 26%, to $114.9 million
    in 2007 from $155.4 million in 2006, as we aligned the
    number of employees with the then current and anticipated loan
    origination and title service levels. Our financial services
    operations employed approximately 1,100 and 1,700 employees
    at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense
    increased by 450 basis points, to 74.0% in 2007, from 69.5%
    in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in
    revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume
    during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss expense
    discussed above. Fluctuations in financial services G&A
    expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due
    to changes in the amount of revenue earned, as some expenses are
    not directly related to mortgage loan volume.

Interest and other income decreased 32%, to $38.5 million
    in 2007 from $56.9 million in 2006, primarily due to the
    decreased volume of loan originations.

Overview
    of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity

We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial
    services operations with cash flows from operating activities,
    borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of
    new debt securities. As we have utilized our capital resources
    and liquidity to fund our operations, we have focused on
    maintaining a strong balance sheet.

At September 30, 2008, our ratio of net homebuilding debt
    to total capital was 43.6%, an increase of 340 basis points
    from 40.2% at September 30, 2007. Net homebuilding debt to
    total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash
    divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable
    net of cash plus stockholders’ equity). The increase in our
    ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at
    September 30, 2008 as compared with the ratio a year
    earlier was primarily due to the decrease in retained earnings,
    which was partially offset by our higher cash balance and lower
    debt balance resulting from the generation of cash flows from
    operations. Our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital
    remains within



our target operating range of below 45%. We believe that our
    strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be
    flexible in reacting to changing market conditions. However,
    future period-end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios
    may be higher than the 43.6% ratio achieved at
    September 30, 2008.

We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total
    capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our
    homebuilding operations and comparing us with other
    homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services
    business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation
    under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized
    and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our
    homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we
    include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding
    debt and total capital. For comparison to our ratios of net
    homebuilding debt to capital above, at September 30, 2008
    and 2007, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital,
    without netting cash balances, were 55.6% and 41.7%,
    respectively.

We believe that we will be able to fund our short-term working
    capital needs for our homebuilding and financial services
    operations and our fiscal 2009 debt maturities through existing
    cash resources and the cash flows from operations we expect to
    generate in fiscal 2009. Although we do not currently anticipate
    a need to borrow from our revolving credit facility in fiscal
    2009, we are currently exploring alternatives with regard to the
    facility, which could potentially include an amendment to the
    current agreement. For the longer term, in addition to utilizing
    existing cash resources and cash flows generated from operations
    in the future, we expect to fund our operations through a
    renewed or amended credit facility and, if needed, the issuance
    of new securities through the public capital markets, subject to
    market conditions.

Homebuilding
    Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2008, we had available homebuilding cash and
    cash equivalents of $1.4 billion.

Bank Credit Facility and Indentures

— We have a
    $1.65 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which
    includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit sub-facility. The
    revolving credit facility, which matures on December 16,
    2011, has an uncommitted accordion provision of
    $400 million which could be used to increase the size of
    the facility to $2.05 billion upon obtaining additional
    commitments from lenders. Our borrowing capacity, including the
    issuance of letters of credit, under this facility is reduced by
    the amount of letters of credit outstanding, and is currently
    further reduced by the limitations in effect under the borrowing
    base arrangement to $52.8 million, as more fully described
    below. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries other than our financial services
    subsidiaries. Borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the
    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon
    our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement, our ratio
    of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted interest incurred and our senior
    unsecured debt rating. We may borrow funds through the revolving
    credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital
    requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated
    from our operations and, in the past, from the issuance of
    public securities. At September 30, 2008, we had no cash
    borrowings and $71.6 million of standby letters of credit
    outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility and
    the interest rate was 5.5%. In addition to the stated interest
    rates, the revolving credit facility requires us to pay certain
    fees.

In January 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement,
    the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from
    $2.5 billion to $2.25 billion. The amendment also
    revised certain financial covenants, including reducing the
    required level of minimum tangible net worth and reducing the
    maximum leverage ratio. Additionally, the amendment modified the
    adjusted EBITDA to adjusted interest incurred covenant such that
    it can no longer result in an event of default.

In June 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement, the
    size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from
    $2.25 billion to $1.65 billion. The amendment further
    reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and modified
    the leverage ratio calculation. In addition, the amendment
    increased the maximum residential land and lots to tangible net
    worth ratio and modified tangible net worth to include certain
    capital stock. The amendment also changed the pricing terms of
    our revolving credit facility, whereby the interest rate spread
    on borrowings and on unused committed capacity was increased.



Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit
    facility, if we have fewer than two investment grade senior
    unsecured debt ratings from Moody’s Investors Service,
    Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, we
    are subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions on
    unsold homes and residential land and lots. During the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 both Standard & Poor’s and
    Moody’s downgraded our senior debt rating to below
    investment grade status; therefore, these additional limitations
    became effective and are currently in effect. During the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008, our senior debt rating was downgraded by
    all three rating agencies, and on November 26, 2008, was
    further downgraded by Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s to their current levels as follows: Moody’s
    (Ba3); Standard & Poor’s (BB−); and
    Fitch (BB+).

Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt
    and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not
    exceed the lesser of (a) certain percentages of the
    acquisition cost of various categories of our unencumbered
    inventory or (b) certain percentages of the book value of
    various categories of our unencumbered inventory, cash and cash
    equivalents. At September 30, 2008, the borrowing base
    arrangement limited our additional borrowing capacity from any
    source, including the issuance of letters of credit, to
    $52.8 million. Reductions of outstanding debt will increase
    our capacity under the borrowing base, while reductions of
    inventory will generally decrease our borrowing base capacity.
    Consequently, to the extent our debt balance declines at a
    faster pace than further inventory reductions, we would expect
    our capacity to increase under the borrowing base. Based on our
    current cash balance and expectations for cash flows, we
    currently do not anticipate a need to borrow from our revolving
    credit facility in the near term; however, we are exploring
    alternatives with regard to this credit facility, which could
    potentially include an amendment to the current agreement.

The revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our
    operations and activities by requiring us to maintain certain
    levels of leverage, tangible net worth and components of
    inventory. If we do not maintain the requisite levels, we may
    not be able to pay dividends or available financing could be
    reduced or terminated. In addition, the indentures governing our
    senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions
    on the creation of secured debt.

Based on the terms of the credit agreement as amended in June
    2008, the following table presents the revised levels required
    to maintain our compliance with the financial covenants
    associated with our revolving credit facility, and the levels
    achieved as of and for the period ended September 30, 2008.
    These covenants are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter.
    They are required to be maintained by us and all of our direct
    and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, Guarantor
    Subsidiaries), other than the financial services subsidiaries
    and certain inconsequential subsidiaries (collectively,
    Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries).

Prior to June 20, 2008, our senior subordinated notes
    indenture contained restrictions that became operative if our
    Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the
    indenture, for four fiscal quarters was not at least 2.0 to 1.0.
    If we failed to satisfy this ratio, we would have been precluded
    from making certain restricted payments, including dividends,
    and incurring additional debt other than certain refinancing
    indebtedness, purchase money indebtedness or other permitted
    indebtedness that were not dependent on this ratio, including
    $1 billion principal amount of indebtedness under our
    revolving credit facility at any time outstanding.

In May 2008, we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of
    our outstanding 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010
    for an equal principal amount of new 9.75% senior notes due
    2010. In conjunction with the exchange offer, we solicited
    consents to an amendment to the indenture governing the senior
    subordinated notes that would eliminate many of the restrictive
    covenants applicable to the senior subordinated notes as
    described above. For each $1,000 principal amount of senior
    subordinated notes tendered prior to the expiration of the
    consent solicitation on June 4, 2008, holders received a
    consent payment of $10. On June 20, 2008, the exchange
    offer and related solicitation of consents to amend the
    indenture closed, with $96.8 million principal amount of
    the senior subordinated notes having been tendered for exchange,
    and $16.7 million principal amount of the 9.75% senior
    subordinated notes remaining under the amended indenture. As a
    result of the amendment to the indenture, many of the
    restrictive covenants contained in the indenture were
    eliminated, including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage
    Ratio discussed above.

At September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all of
    the financial covenants, limitations and restrictions that form
    a part of the bank revolving credit facility and the public debt
    obligations. However, the margin by which we have complied with
    the tangible net worth covenant of our revolving credit facility
    has



declined. If our operating results and inventory impairments
    continue at recent levels, our tangible net worth may decline
    below the minimum level required by the revolving credit
    facility during fiscal 2009. Consequently, we intend to seek an
    amendment to our revolving credit facility to modify the
    covenant provisions included in the credit facility before our
    tangible net worth declines below the minimum required level.
    The amendment may also include, among other things, a reduction
    in the commitment amount under the facility and price increases
    on borrowings and unused commitment amounts. We cannot assure
    that we will be successful in these efforts or that the terms or
    amount of any revised financing will not have an adverse effect
    on us, our business, capital resources or financial results.

Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt —

On
    December 1, 2007, we repaid the $215 million principal
    amount of our 7.5% senior notes which became due on that
    date.

In February 2008, through an unsolicited transaction, we
    repurchased $36.5 million principal amount of our
    9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase
    price of $36.0 million, plus accrued interest. The gain of
    $0.5 million is included in homebuilding other income in
    our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2008.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, through unsolicited
    transactions, we repurchased $35.3 million principal amount
    of our 8% senior notes due 2009 at their face value, plus
    accrued interest, and $1.40 million principal amount of our
    9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase
    price of $1.36 million, plus accrued interest.

In November 2008, through unsolicited transactions, we
    repurchased a total of $102.9 million principal amount of
    various issues of our senior notes due in 2009 and 2010 for an
    aggregate purchase price of $98.2 million.

Shelf Registration Statements —

We have an
    automatically effective universal shelf registration statement
    filed with the SEC, registering debt and equity securities which
    we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined.
    Also, at September 30, 2008, we had the capacity to issue
    approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our
    acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or
    in part, possible future business acquisitions.

Financial
    Services Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— At
    September 30, 2008, we had available financial services
    cash and cash equivalents of $31.7 million.

Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility

— DHI Mortgage
    had a $540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that
    matured March 28, 2008. This facility was not renewed upon
    maturity, but was replaced with the mortgage repurchase facility
    described below.

Commercial Paper Conduit Facility

— DHI
    Mortgage had a $600 million commercial paper conduit
    facility (the “CP conduit facility”) with a maturity
    date of June 27, 2009. Effective April 1, 2008, the CP
    conduit facility was voluntarily terminated by agreement of the
    parties.

Mortgage Repurchase Facility

— On
    March 28, 2008, DHI Mortgage entered into a mortgage sale
    and repurchase agreement (the “mortgage repurchase
    facility”), that matures March 26, 2009. The mortgage
    repurchase facility, which replaced the mortgage warehouse loan
    facility, provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by
    facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage
    transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the
    transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming
    purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
    to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third party
    investors in the secondary market or upon a specified time per
    the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. As of
    September 30, 2008, $333.7 million of mortgage loans
    held for sale were pledged under this repurchase arrangement.
    The mortgage repurchase facility is accounted for as a secured
    financing. The facility has a capacity of $275 million,
    subject to an accordion feature that could increase the total
    capacity to $500 million based on obtaining increased
    committed sums from existing counterparties, new commitments
    from prospective counterparties, or a combination of both. In
    addition, DHI Mortgage has the option to fund a



portion of its repurchase obligations in advance. As a result of
    advance fundings totaling $106.9 million, DHI Mortgage had
    an obligation of $203.5 million outstanding under the
    mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2008 at a
    4.9% interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our
    homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as
    to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum required tangible net
    worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net
    worth, its minimum required net income and its minimum required
    liquidity. At September 30, 2008, our mortgage subsidiary
    was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of
    the mortgage repurchase facility. However, the margin by which
    we have complied with the minimum required net income covenant
    of this facility has declined. If our financial services
    operating results continue at current levels, this calculation
    may decline below the required level before the expiration date
    of the facility. Consequently, we intend to seek an amendment to
    our mortgage repurchase facility to modify the covenant
    provisions included in the facility before then. We cannot
    assure that we will be successful in these efforts or that the
    terms or amount of any revised financing will not have an
    adverse effect on us, our business, capital resources or
    financial results.

In the past, we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage
    credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their
    maturities, and obtain temporary additional commitments through
    amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of
    higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The
    recent volatility in the credit markets and losses sustained by
    many banks will likely make renewing this facility more
    challenging and more expensive. The liquidity of our financial
    services business depends upon our continued ability to renew
    and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other
    additional financing in sufficient capacities.

Operating
    Cash Flow Activities

During the year ended September 30, 2008, net cash provided
    by our operating activities was $1.9 billion, as compared
    to $1.4 billion during the prior year. During fiscal 2008,
    we continued to limit our investments in inventory, as evidenced
    by a $2.1 billion decrease in owned inventory (excluding
    the impact of impairments and write-offs) during the fiscal
    year, compared to a $737.6 million decrease in fiscal 2007.
    In light of the challenging market conditions, we have
    substantially slowed our purchases of land and lots and our
    development spending on land we own, and have restricted the
    number of homes under construction to better match our expected
    rate of home sales and closings. We plan to continue to restrict
    our number of homes under construction and significantly limit
    our development spending during fiscal 2009. Our ability to
    reduce our inventory levels is, however, heavily dependent upon
    our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the
    year, which may prove difficult given the current market
    conditions. To the extent our inventory levels decrease at
    planned levels during fiscal 2009, we expect to generate net
    positive cash flows from operating activities, should all other
    factors remain constant; however, the amount of cash generated
    in the future may be less than in prior periods. Additionally,
    we expect the receipt of our federal income tax refund of
    $676.2 million to contribute to positive cash flow from
    operations in fiscal 2009.

Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in
    fiscal 2008 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of
    $171.4 million during the year. The decrease in mortgage
    loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans
    originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect to continue to use
    cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in
    quarters when our homebuilding closings grow. However, in
    periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to
    prior periods, or if our mortgage capture rate declines, the
    amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate
    positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage
    loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2008.

Investing
    Cash Flow Activities

In fiscal 2008 and 2007, cash used in investing activities
    represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily
    model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are
    not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, but
    were reduced in fiscal 2008 in light of the weaker market
    conditions.



Financing
    Cash Flow Activities

The majority of our short-term financing needs have been funded
    with cash generated from operations and borrowings available
    under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities.
    Long-term financing needs of our homebuilding operations have
    been generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured
    debt securities through the public capital markets. Our
    homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings
    under our homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed
    by substantially all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries other than
    our financial services subsidiaries.

During fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors approved two
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share and two
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.075 per common share, the last of
    which was paid on August 28, 2008 to stockholders of record
    on August 18, 2008. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per
    common share were paid in each quarter of fiscal 2007. On
    November 20, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a cash
    dividend of $0.0375 per common share, payable on
    December 18, 2008, to stockholders of record on
    December 8, 2008. The declaration of future cash dividends
    is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend
    upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital
    requirements, our financial condition and general business
    conditions, as well as compliance with covenants contained in
    our revolving credit agreement.

Changes
    in Capital Structure

In November 2007, our Board of Directors extended its
    authorizations for the repurchase of up to $463.2 million
    of our common stock and the repurchase of debt securities of up
    to $500 million to November 30, 2008. Through
    unsolicited transactions during fiscal 2008, we repurchased
    $37.9 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior
    subordinated notes due 2010 and $35.3 million principal
    amount of our 8% senior notes due 2009, which reduced the
    remaining debt repurchase authorization to $426.8 million
    at September 30, 2008. Upon expiration of the November 2007
    authorizations, our Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock and
    the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities.
    The new authorizations are effective from December 1, 2008
    to November 30, 2009.

In fiscal 2008, our primary non-operating uses of our available
    capital were the repayment of debt, and dividend payments. We
    expect the repayment of debt to remain a significant priority
    for the use of cash in fiscal 2009. We continue to evaluate our
    alternatives for future non-operating uses of our available
    capital, including the amounts of planned debt repayments,
    dividend payments and maintenance of cash balances, based on
    market conditions and other circumstances, and within the
    constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets, our liquidity
    targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements.

Contractual
    Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding
    and financial services segments are payments under short-term
    and long-term debt agreements and lease payments under operating
    leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment
    represent specific performance requirements under lot option
    purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land
    contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We
    expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary
    course of business through a combination of our existing cash
    resources, cash flows generated from operations, renewed or
    amended credit facilities and, if needed, the issuance of new
    securities through the public capital markets, subject to market
    conditions.



Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of
    September 30, 2008 are presented below:

Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest
    payments due on our senior and senior subordinated notes, our
    revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The principal
    amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be $0
    through its maturity.

(2)

Financial services notes payable represent principal and
    interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary’s
    repurchase facility. The interest obligation associated with
    this variable rate facility is based on its effective rate of
    4.9% and principal balance outstanding at September 30,
    2008.

At September 30, 2008, our homebuilding operations had
    outstanding letters of credit of $71.6 million and surety
    bonds of $1.6 billion, issued by third parties, to secure
    performance under various contracts. We expect that our
    performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and
    bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of
    business and in accordance with the applicable contractual
    terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related
    letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly
    thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have
    no material third-party guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related
    to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further
    discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk” under Part II of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot
    option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the
    construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control
    significant lot positions with limited capital investment and
    substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership
    and development. Within the land and lot option purchase
    contracts in force at September 30, 2008, there were a
    limited number of contracts, representing only
    $48.0 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase
    the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their
    obligations. We consolidated certain variable interest entities
    with assets of $21.7 million related to some of our
    outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. Creditors,
    if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse
    against us. Additionally, pursuant to SFAS No. 49,
    “Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements,” we
    recorded $16.9 million of land inventory not owned related
    to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase
    contracts. Further discussion of our land option contracts is
    provided in the “Land and Lot Position and Homes in
    Inventory” section that follows.

At September 30, 2008, we owned or controlled approximately
    125,000 lots, 21% of which were lots under option or similar
    contracts, compared with approximately 230,000 lots at
    September 30, 2007. Our current strategy is to continue to
    reduce our owned and controlled lot position, in line with our
    reduced expectations for future home sales and closings, through
    the construction and sale of homes and sales of land and lots,
    along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots currently
    controlled under option or in opportunistically acquired new lot
    positions.

At September 30, 2008, we controlled approximately 26,000
    lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately
    $732.3 million under land and lot option purchase
    contracts, with a total of $50.9 million in earnest money
    deposits. Our lots controlled included approximately 8,000
    optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately
    $247.9 million and secured by deposits totaling
    $23.4 million, for which we do not expect to exercise our
    option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not
    yet been terminated. Consequently, we have written off the
    deposits related to these contracts, resulting in a net earnest
    money deposit balance of $27.5 million at
    September 30, 2008.

We had a total of approximately 12,400 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 1,500 model homes at September 30,
    2008, compared to approximately 19,900 homes in inventory,
    including approximately 2,000 model homes at September 30,
    2007. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 6,900 and
    10,600 were unsold at September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. At September 30, 2008, approximately 3,100 of
    our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 1,100
    homes had been completed for more than six months. At
    September 30, 2007, approximately 5,000 of our unsold homes
    were completed, of which approximately 1,100 homes had been
    completed for more than six months. Our strategy is to continue
    to restrict and adjust our total number of homes in inventory
    and our number of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2009
    as necessary, to match our reduced expectations for future home
    sales and closings. In addition, we will continue our efforts to
    opportunistically sell excess land and lot positions in certain
    markets.

Seasonality

We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our
    quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Before the
    current housing downturn, we generally had more homes under
    construction, closed more homes and had greater revenues and
    operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal
    year. This seasonal activity increased our working capital
    requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third
    and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding
    requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial
    services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of
    seasonal activity, our results of



operations and financial position at the end of a particular
    fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance
    of our fiscal year.

In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further
    deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during the last
    two years, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our
    third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and in all quarters of
    fiscal 2008. These results were primarily due to recording
    significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges. Also, the
    increasingly challenging market conditions caused declines in
    sales volume, pricing and margins that mitigated our historical
    seasonal variations. Although we may experience our typical
    historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current
    market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or
    whether this pattern will recur.

Inflation

We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely
    affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of
    higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs.
    In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly
    affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to
    prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our
    customers any increases in our costs through increased sales
    prices. However, during periods of soft housing market
    conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases,
    particularly higher land costs, with higher selling prices.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in
    other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC,
    statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral
    statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in
    the course of presentations about us, may be construed as
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E
    of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements are based on management’s beliefs as well as
    assumptions made by, and information currently available to,
    management. These forward-looking statements typically include

Critical
    Accounting Policies

General

— A comprehensive enumeration of the
    significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and
    subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying
    financial statements as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, and
    for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Each
    of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current
    authoritative literature that collectively comprises
    U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In
    instances where alternative methods of accounting are
    permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most
    appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results
    of our operations and our financial condition, and have
    consistently applied those methods over each of the periods
    presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting
    policies selected.

Basis of Presentation

— Our financial
    statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of
    its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. We
    have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from
    which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts,
    under the requirements of Interpretation No. 46,
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — an
    interpretation of ARB No. 51” as amended
    (FIN 46R), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB). All significant intercompany accounts,
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

— We generally recognize
    homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the
    closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property
    are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the
    buyer’s financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our
    wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an
    adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by
    SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred
    until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party
    investor has been completed. Also in accordance with
    SFAS No. 66, the recognition of land sales is deferred
    when the full accrual method criteria is not met. We include
    amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each
    reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales
    contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance
    payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options
    related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as
    liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are
    canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits
    on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable
    provisions of the contract or other circumstances.

We recognize financial services revenues associated with our
    title operations as closing services are rendered and title
    insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur
    simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially
    all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies
    to third-party insurers. Origination fees and direct origination
    costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses,
    respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the
    sales of the loans, when the loans are sold to third party
    investors. As required by SAB 109 issued by the SEC in
    November 2007, the expected net future cash flows related to the
    associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement
    of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair
    value through earnings at the time of commitment. SAB 109
    was effective for us on January 1, 2008 and has been
    applied prospectively to commitments issued or modified after
    that date. We generally do not retain or service the mortgages
    that we originate but, rather, seek to sell



the mortgages and related servicing rights to third-party
    investors. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage
    loan is originated until the loan is sold.

Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at cost adjusted for
    changes in fair value after the date of designation of an
    effective accounting hedge, based on either sale commitments or
    current market quotes. Some loans are sold with limited recourse
    provisions. Based on historical experience and current housing
    and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a total
    loss reserve predominantly for mortgage loans held in portfolio
    and mortgage loans held for sale. Unhedged loans, or those not
    in a designated accounting hedge, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market. Market is determined by either sales commitments
    or current market conditions.

Inventories and Cost of Sales

— Inventory
    includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development
    and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes
    and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home
    construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur
    after development projects or homes are substantially complete,
    such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to
    SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such
    as compensation of sales personnel and division and region
    management, advertising and builder’s risk insurance are
    charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. We use the specific
    identification method for the purpose of accumulating home
    construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the
    specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are generally allocated on a
    pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community.

When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and
    recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each
    month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales
    the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to
    completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that
    month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual
    recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be
    paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each
    month’s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on
    closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously
    accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on
    previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals,
    historically, differences in amounts have not been significant.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and
    related communities under development are reviewed for potential
    write-downs when impairment indicators are present. We generally
    review our inventory at the community level and the inventory
    within each community may be categorized as land held for
    development, residential land and lots developed and under
    development, and construction in progress and finished homes,
    based on the stage of production or plans for future
    development. A particular community often includes inventory in
    more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be
    analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product
    type (e.g. single family homes evaluated separately from
    condominium parcels). In reviewing each of our communities, we
    determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and
    used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not
    limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.



If indicators of impairment are present for a community,
    SFAS No. 144 requires an analysis to determine if the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, and if so,
    impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value
    of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These
    estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community
    specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing
    of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land
    development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be
    impacted by the following local market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of our communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;

•

alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of
    land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;

•

amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market
    or sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our
    determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting
    the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the
    inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated
    cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is
    determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the
    community in the same manner as land and development costs are
    allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is
    categorized as construction in progress and finished homes,
    residential land and lots — developed and under
    development, and land held for development, based on the stage
    of production or plans for future development.

We generally do not purchase land for resale. However, when we
    own land or communities under development that no longer fit
    into our development and construction plans and we determine
    that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset, the
    project is accounted for as land held for sale, assuming the
    land held for sale criteria defined in SFAS No. 144
    are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its
    carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In
    performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we
    consider several factors including, but not limited to, prices
    for land in recent comparable sales transactions, market
    analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing
    buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers
    received. If the estimated fair value less cost to sell an asset
    is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written
    down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges
    are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed
    communities when events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying values are greater than the fair value less estimated
    costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. Our quarterly assessments reflect management’s
    estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of
    held-for-sale assets through the disposition date.

Land and Lot Option Purchase Contracts

— In the
    ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter into land
    and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for
    the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts,
    we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right,
    but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future
    point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the
    option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are not
    refundable at our discretion.

Option deposits and pre-acquisition costs we incur related to
    our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized in
    accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for
    Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real



Estate Projects,” if all of the following conditions have
    been met: (1) the costs are directly identifiable with the
    specific property; (2) the costs would be capitalized if
    the property were already acquired; and (3) acquisition of
    the property is probable, meaning we are actively seeking and
    have the ability to acquire the property, and there is no
    indication that the property is not available for sale. We also
    consider the following when determining if the acquisition of
    the property is probable: (1) changes in market conditions
    subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land;
    (2) current contract terms, including per lot price and
    required purchase dates; and (3) our current land position
    in the given market or sub-market. Option deposits and
    capitalized pre-acquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales
    when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire
    the land or lots under option and will not be able to recover
    these costs through other means.

We also evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts in
    accordance with the provisions of FIN 46R. FIN 46R
    provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of
    interests in certain variable interest entities, which
    FIN 46R defines as certain business entities that either
    have equity investors with voting rights disproportionate to
    their ownership interests, or have equity investors that do not
    provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to
    support their activities. FIN 46R requires consolidation of
    such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of
    the risk of loss from the entities’ activities or is
    entitled to receive a majority of the entities’ residual
    returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the
    variable interest entity. Under the requirements of
    FIN 46R, certain of our option purchase contracts result in
    the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the
    land parcel under option.

In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, we evaluate those
    land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest
    entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary
    based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and
    losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the
    primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into
    a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest
    entity is consolidated.

Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated
    variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to
    FIN 46R, we generally have little or no control or
    influence over the operations of these entities or their owners.
    When our requests for financial information are denied by the
    land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and
    liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the
    fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been
    assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the
    land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed
    that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset
    recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a
    related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party
    investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any,
    of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us.

Goodwill

— Goodwill represents the excess of
    purchase price over net assets acquired. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” we test goodwill for potential impairment annually
    as of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or
    circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of
    goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential
    impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a
    two-step process that begins with the estimation of the fair
    value of the reporting units. The fair value is estimated
    primarily utilizing the present values of expected future cash
    flows. If the results of the first step indicate that impairment
    potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the
    amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to
    exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its
    carrying value.

Warranty Costs

— We have established warranty
    reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty
    liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged
    to be adequate to cover expected warranty-related costs for
    materials and labor required under one-year and ten-year
    warranty obligation periods. The one-year warranty is
    comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten-year period is
    for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are
    based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each
    market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to
    reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we
    build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual
    future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated
    amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to
    estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material
    change in our accrual.



Insurance Claim Costs

— We have, and require
    the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general
    liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and
    workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect
    us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to
    certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage
    limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or
    expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general
    liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from
    subcontractors. We self-insure a portion of our overall risk,
    partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which
    issues a general liability policy to us, naming some
    subcontractors as additional insureds.

We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover
    our self-insured and deductible amounts under our insurance
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our
    coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an
    analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of
    construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported.
    Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to
    a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends
    in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the
    types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance
    industry practices and legal interpretations, among others.
    Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining
    these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could
    differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10%
    increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used
    to estimate the self-insured accruals would result in an
    increase of approximately $70 million in our accrual, while
    a 10% decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim
    would result in a decrease of approximately $25 million in
    our accrual.

Income Taxes

— We calculate a provision for
    income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by
    identifying the temporary differences arising from the different
    treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes,” a reduction in the carrying amounts of
    deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if,
    based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that
    such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we periodically
    assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred
    tax assets based on the SFAS No. 109
    more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. In the
    assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration
    is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the
    realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment
    considers, among other matters, the taxable income available in
    current statutory carryback periods; reversals of existing
    taxable temporary differences; tax planning strategies; the
    nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses;
    the duration of statutory carryforward periods; our historical
    experience in generating operating profits; and expectations for
    future profitability. In making such judgments, significant
    weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.
    SFAS No. 109 provides that a cumulative loss in recent
    years is significant negative evidence in considering whether
    deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount
    of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support
    the recovery of deferred tax assets. The accounting for deferred
    taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences
    between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax
    consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing
    tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation
    of deferred tax assets over time.

On October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
    disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken on a tax return, including the minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. Effective with our
    adoption of FIN 48, interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial
    statements as a component of the income tax provision. Interest
    and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were
    previously included in interest expense and in selling, general
    and administrative expense, respectively. Significant judgment
    is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our
    uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations
    are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts
    or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax
    authorities during the course of audits and



effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition
    or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in
    material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the
    period in which we make the change.

Stock-based Compensation

— With the approval of
    our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of
    our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees
    and directors options to purchase our common stock. The
    committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining
    available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our
    common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with
    exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on
    the date of the option grant. The majority of the options
    granted vest ratably over a ten-year period.

On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate
    the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. Determining the fair value of share-based awards
    at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions,
    which involve a number of variables. These variables include,
    but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over
    the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected
    stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use
    judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are
    expected to be forfeited.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2,

which partially defers the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities,
    except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
    in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. We have evaluated
    the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 and it is
    not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” The statement permits entities to choose to
    measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 and determined that mortgage loans
    originated and held for sale after October 1, 2008 will be
    accounted for at fair value. While our interest rate risk
    management policies have not changed, the effect of this
    standard will alleviate the documentation requirements to
    account for these instruments as fair value accounting hedges
    and we will no longer defer the recognition of net origination
    costs and fees. The implementation of this standard is not
    expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    The statement clarifies the accounting for noncontrolling
    interests and establishes accounting and reporting standards for
    the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, including
    classification as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160
    is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. We
    are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160; however, it is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations,”
    (SFAS No. 141(R)). The statement replaces
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” and
    provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also
    provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the
    financial



statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
    business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and
    is to be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133.” The statement amends and expands the
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” It requires qualitative disclosures about
    objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
    disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on
    derivative instruments, and disclosures about
    credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
    agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years
    and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    principal impact of this statement will be to require us to
    expand the disclosure regarding our derivative instruments, and
    will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” The
    statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and
    the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the
    preparation of financial statements for nongovernmental entities
    that are presented in conformity with GAAP.
    SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following
    the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The
    Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.” We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163,
    “Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance
    Contracts — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 60.” The statement requires that an insurance
    entity recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default
    (insured event) when there is evidence that credit deterioration
    has occurred in an insured financial obligation.
    SFAS No. 163 also clarifies the application of
    SFAS No. 60 “Accounting and Reporting by
    Insurance Enterprises” to financial guarantee insurance
    contracts and expands disclosure requirements surrounding such
    contracts. SFAS No. 163 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 163; however, it is
    not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When The
    Market For That Asset Is Not Active.” The staff position
    clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, “Fair
    Value Measurements” in a market that is not active.

FSP 157-3

became effective upon issuance, including prior periods for
    which financial statements have not been issued. We adopted this
    FSP as of September 30, 2008, and it did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operation or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. We
    monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize
    both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes
    in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt
    instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for
    variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not
    impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our
    future earnings and cash flows. We generally do not have an
    obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a
    result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not
    have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our
    fixed-rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance,
    repurchase or repay such debt.

We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our
    mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk
    through the use of forward sales of mortgage-backed securities
    (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on
    mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the term
    “hedging instruments” in the following discussion
    refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination.
    We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or
    speculative purposes.



Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers
    who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit
    and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration
    of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to
    a specific investor through the use of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to
    being committed to third-party investors. The hedging
    instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as
    non-designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses
    recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments related to
    funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges,
    with changes in the value of the derivative instruments
    recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value
    of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair
    value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness,
    which for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At
    September 30, 2008, hedging instruments to mitigate
    interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held
    for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $623.3 million.
    Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than
    six months, totaled approximately $193.5 million, and
    uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately
    $80.7 million at September 30, 2008. At
    September 30, 2008, we did not have any designated
    accounting hedges, and the fair value of the hedging instruments
    and IRLCs at September 30, 2008 was an insignificant amount.

We also purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic
    interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer
    homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing.
    At September 30, 2008, these potential mortgage loan
    originations totaled approximately $79.8 million and were
    hedged with economic interest rate hedges of
    $1,068.9 million in EDFC put options and $34.3 million
    in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate
    hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months.
    These instruments are considered non-designated derivatives and
    are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized
    in current earnings. The gains and losses for the years ended
    September 30, 2008 and 2007 were not significant.

The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled
    maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair
    value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2008. The
    interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted
    average interest rates in effect at September 30, 2008.
    Because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured
    by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold
    within 60 days, its outstanding balance is included as a
    variable rate maturity in the most current period presented.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R. Horton, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and
    the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc.
    and its subsidiaries (the Company) at September 30, 2008
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
    year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    September 30, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting, included in the Management’s Report on Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
    Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audit. We conducted
    our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A —
    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (GAAP) and include the accounts of D. R. Horton, Inc.
    and all of its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled
    subsidiaries (which are referred to as the Company, unless the
    context otherwise requires), as well as certain variable
    interest entities required to be consolidated pursuant to
    Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — an interpretation of ARB
    No. 51,” as amended (FIN 46R), issued by the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). All significant
    intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
    those estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition

Homebuilding revenue and related profit are generally recognized
    at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and
    possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In
    situations where the buyer’s financing is originated by DHI
    Mortgage, the Company’s wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary,
    and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing
    investment as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real
    Estate,” the profit on such sales is deferred until the
    sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party investor has
    been completed. At September 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    had deferred profit on such sales in the amounts of
    $5.8 million and $32.6 million, respectively. Sales of
    land are evaluated and profit is deferred until the full accrual
    method criteria are met as prescribed by SFAS No. 66.

Financial services revenues associated with the Company’s
    title operations are recognized as closing services are rendered
    and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally
    occur simultaneously as each home is closed. The Company
    transfers substantially all underwriting risk associated with
    title insurance policies to third-party insurers. Origination
    fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as
    revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated
    gains and losses on the sales of the loans, when the loans are
    sold to third party investors. As required by Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 109, “Written Loan Commitments
    Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings”
    (SAB 109) issued by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) in November 2007, the expected net future cash
    flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included
    in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of
    commitment. The Company generally does not retain or service the
    mortgages that it originates but, rather, seeks to sell the
    mortgages and related servicing rights to third-party investors.
    Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is
    originated until the loan is sold.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an
    initial maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
    cash equivalents. Amounts in transit from title companies for
    home closings are included in homebuilding cash.

Restricted
    Cash

The Company holds cash that is restricted as to its use.
    Restricted cash related to the Company’s homebuilding
    operations includes customer deposits that are temporarily
    restricted in accordance with



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    the balances of restricted cash were $2.0 million and
    $5.4 million, respectively, and are included in other
    assets on the Company’s balance sheet.

Inventories
    and Cost of Sales

Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land
    development and home construction, capitalized interest, real
    estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during
    development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead
    costs incurred after development projects or homes are
    substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and
    cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative
    (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs,
    such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region
    management, and the costs of advertising and builder’s risk
    insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred.

Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual
    residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of
    residential lots are transferred to construction in progress
    when home construction begins. The specific identification
    method is used for the purpose of accumulating home construction
    costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific
    construction costs of each home and all applicable land
    acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred
    and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of
    homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to
    the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial
    home closings in a community are generally allocated on a
    pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community.

When a home is closed, the Company generally has not yet paid
    and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home.
    Each month a liability and a charge to cost of sales is recorded
    for the amount that is determined will ultimately be paid
    related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end
    of that month. The home construction budgets are compared to
    actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs
    remaining to be paid on each closed home. The accuracy of each
    month’s accrual is monitored by comparing actual costs
    incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount
    previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the
    future on previously closed homes could differ from the
    Company’s current accruals, historically, differences in
    amounts have not been significant.

Each quarter, all components of inventory are reviewed for the
    purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required
    to complete each home or project are recoverable. If the review
    indicates that an impairment loss is required under the
    guidelines of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” an estimate
    of the loss is made and recorded to cost of sales in that
    quarter.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and
    related communities under development are reviewed for potential
    write-downs when impairment indicators are present. The Company
    generally reviews its inventory at the community level and the
    inventory within each community may be categorized as land held
    for development, residential land and lots developed and under
    development, and construction in progress and finished homes,
    based on the stage of production or plans for future
    development. A particular community often includes inventory in
    more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be
    analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product
    type (e.g. single family homes evaluated separately from
    condominium parcels). In reviewing each of its communities, the
    Company determines if impairment indicators exist on inventory
    held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but
    not limited to, the following:

•

gross margins on homes closed in recent months;

•

projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed;

•

projected gross margins based on community budgets;

•

trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales;



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

sales absorption rates; and

•

performance of other communities in nearby locations.

If indicators of impairment are present for a community,
    SFAS No. 144 requires an analysis to determine if the
    undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
    assets are less than their carrying amounts, and if so,
    impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value
    of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These
    estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community
    specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing
    of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land
    development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be
    impacted by the following local market conditions:

•

supply and availability of new and existing homes;

•

location and desirability of the Company’s communities;

•

variety of product types offered in the area;

•

pricing and use of incentives by the Company and its competitors;

•

alternative uses for the Company’s land or communities such
    as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third
    parties;

•

amount of land and lots the Company owns or controls in a
    particular market or sub-market; and

•

local economic and demographic trends.

For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be
    recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The
    Company’s determination of fair value is primarily based on
    discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with
    the inherent risks associated with the assets and related
    estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a
    community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each
    lot in the community in the same manner as land and development
    costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each
    community is categorized as construction in progress and
    finished homes, residential land and lots — developed
    and under development, and land held for development, based on
    the stage of production or plans for future development.

The Company generally does not purchase land for resale.
    However, when the Company owns land or communities under
    development that no longer fit into its development and
    construction plans and it is determined that the best use of the
    asset is the sale of the asset, the project is accounted for as
    land held for sale, assuming the land held for sale criteria
    defined in SFAS No. 144 are met. The Company records
    land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair
    value less estimated costs to sell. In performing impairment
    evaluation for land held for sale, several factors are
    considered including, but not limited to, prices for land in
    recent comparable sales transactions, market analysis studies,
    which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for
    the land and recent legitimate offers received. If the estimated
    fair value less cost to sell an asset is less than the current
    carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair
    value less cost to sell.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges
    are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed
    communities when events or circumstances indicate that the
    carrying values are greater than the fair value less estimated
    costs to sell these homes.

The key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by
    local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors,
    and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the
    estimation process, actual results could differ from such
    estimates. The Company’s quarterly assessments reflect
    management’s estimates and it continues to monitor the fair
    value of held-for-sale assets through the disposition date. See
    Note B.



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Homebuilding
    Interest

The Company capitalizes homebuilding interest costs to inventory
    during development and construction. Capitalized interest is
    charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered
    to the buyer. Additionally, the Company writes off a portion of
    the capitalized interest related to communities for which
    inventory impairments are recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. Historically, the Company’s
    inventory eligible for interest capitalization (“active
    inventory”) exceeded its debt levels; therefore, the
    Company capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt.
    However, due to the Company’s inventory reduction
    strategies of slowing or suspending land development in certain
    communities and limiting the construction of unsold homes, the
    Company’s active inventory has been lower than its debt
    level in recent quarters, so a portion of the interest incurred
    during those periods was expensed directly to interest expense.
    As all interest incurred is ultimately expensed, this only
    accelerated the expense recognition of the interest incurred
    during the period. In fiscal 2008, the portion of interest
    incurred that was expensed directly to interest expense was
    $39.0 million.

Land
    Inventory Not Owned

The Company accounts for its land and lot option purchase
    contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46R.
    FIN 46R provides guidance for the financial accounting and
    reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities,
    which FIN 46R defines as certain business entities that
    either have equity investors with no voting rights or have
    equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
    resources for the entities to support their activities.
    FIN 46R requires consolidation of such entities by any
    company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
    the entities’ activities or is entitled to receive a
    majority of the entities’ residual returns or both, defined
    as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The
    Company’s land inventory not owned also includes the
    purchase price of certain land and lot option purchase contracts
    that are required to be recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 49, “Accounting for Product Financing
    Arrangements,” and the inventory basis of certain projects
    the Company sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 that
    did not meet the sale recognition criteria of
    SFAS No. 66. See Note C.

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
    depreciation. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred. Depreciation generally is recorded using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
    asset. Depreciable lives for model home furniture typically
    range from 2 to 3 years, depreciable lives for office
    furniture and equipment typically range from 2 to 5 years,
    and depreciable lives for buildings and improvements typically
    range from 5 to 20 years. Accumulated depreciation was
    $156.5 million

and $157.9 million as of September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Depreciation expense was $53.2 million,
    $64.3 million and $56.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets
    acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,
    “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the Company
    tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September
    30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change
    that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be
    recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill,
    SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two-step process that begins
    with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. If
    the results of the first step indicate that impairment
    potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the
    amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to
    exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its
    carrying value. See Note D.

Warranty
    Costs

The Company typically provides its homebuyers a one-year
    comprehensive limited warranty for all parts and labor and a
    ten-year limited warranty for major construction defects. Since
    the Company subcontracts its homebuilding work to subcontractors
    who typically provide it with an indemnity and a certificate of
    insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims
    relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary
    responsibility of the subcontractors. Warranty liabilities have
    been established by charging cost of sales for each home
    delivered. The amounts charged are based on management’s
    estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired
    warranty obligation periods. The Company’s warranty
    liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in
    each market in which it operates and is adjusted as appropriate
    to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes
    built and the geographic areas in which they are built.

Insurance
    Claim Costs

The Company has, and requires the majority of its subcontractors
    to have, general liability insurance (including construction
    defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These
    insurance policies protect the Company against a portion of its
    risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured
    retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In certain
    states where the Company believes it is too difficult or
    expensive for subcontractors to obtain general liability
    insurance, the Company has waived its traditional subcontractor
    general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids
    from subcontractors. The Company self-insures a portion of its
    overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance
    entity which issues a general liability policy to the Company,
    naming certain subcontractors as additional insureds. The
    Company records expenses and liabilities related to the costs to
    cover its self-insured and deductible amounts under those
    policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and
    lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of its
    coverage limits or not covered by such policies, based on an
    analysis of the Company’s historical

claims, which includes an estimate of claims incurred but not
    yet reported. Expenses related to such claims were approximately
    $53.8 million, $95.0 million and $41.7 million in
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Advertising
    Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising
    expense was approximately $60.9 million, $90.6 million
    and $110.6 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes is calculated
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference
    between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the
    realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
    whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
    realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon
    the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
    which those temporary differences become deductible. In
    determining the future tax consequences of events that have been
    recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax
    returns, judgment is required. Differences between the
    anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences
    could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position. See Note G.

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings, or loss, per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each
    year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
    average number of shares of common stock and dilutive securities
    outstanding during each year. In periods with a loss, the
    computation of loss per share excludes outstanding stock options
    because their effect would be antidilutive. See Note H.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

With the approval of the compensation committee, consisting of
    independent members of the Board of Directors, the Company from
    time to time issues to employees and directors options to
    purchase its common stock. The committee approves grants only
    out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts
    formally authorized by the common stockholders.

On October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment,”
    which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under compensation arrangements.
    SFAS No. 123(R) was adopted using the modified
    prospective method. Under this method, the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R) apply to all awards granted or
    modified after the date of adoption. In addition, compensation
    expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option awards
    outstanding as of the date of adoption on a straight-line basis
    over the remaining vesting period. The fair values of the
    options are calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires the
    benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
    expense to be reported in the Statement of Cash Flows as a
    financing cash flow rather than an operating cash flow as
    previously reported. See Note J.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale, Loan Commitments and Related
    Derivatives

Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at cost that is
    adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation
    of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale
    commitments or current market quotes. Any

gain or loss on the sale of loans is recognized at the time of
    sale. Some loans are sold with limited recourse provisions.
    Based on historical experience and current housing and credit
    market conditions, the Company estimates and records a total
    loss reserve predominantly for mortgage loans held in portfolio
    and mortgage loans held for sale. The derivative instruments
    associated with uncommitted, funded loans are typically
    designated as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the
    overall fair value of the related loans. Accordingly, changes in
    the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in
    current earnings, as are changes in the value of the loans.
    Unhedged loans, or those not in a designated accounting hedge,
    are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined
    by either sales commitments or current market conditions.

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is
    party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are
    extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet
    certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and related
    Derivatives Implementation Group conclusions, the Company
    classifies and accounts for IRLCs as non-designated derivative
    instruments at fair value. In November 2007, the SEC issued
    SAB 109, which requires that the expected net future cash
    flows related to the associated servicing of a loan be included
    in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of
    commitment. SAB 109 was effective for the Company on
    January 1, 2008 and has been applied prospectively to
    commitments issued or modified after that date. The Company
    manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs through the use
    of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments and hedging
    instruments as described above. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings.

The Company purchases forward rate agreements (FRAs) and
    economic interest rate hedges as part of a program designed to
    potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on
    their home financing. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. See
    Note F.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” The statement defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP,
    and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 157-2,

which partially defers the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities,
    except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
    in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company has
    evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157
    and it is not expected to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” The statement permits entities to choose to
    measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2007. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 and determined that mortgage loans
    originated and held for sale after October 1, 2008 will be
    accounted for at fair value. While the Company’s interest
    rate risk management policies have not changed, the effect of
    this standard will alleviate the documentation requirements to
    account for these instruments as fair value accounting hedges
    and the recognition of net origination costs and fees will no
    longer be deferred. The implementation of this standard is not
    expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    The statement clarifies the accounting for noncontrolling
    interests and establishes accounting and reporting standards for
    the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, including
    classification as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160
    is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160; however, it is not expected to have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations,”
    (SFAS No. 141(R). The statement replaces
    SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” and
    provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed,
    and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also
    provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R)
    is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact on its
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133.” The statement amends and expands the
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” It requires qualitative disclosures about
    objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
    disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on
    derivative instruments, and disclosures about
    credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
    agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years
    and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    principal impact of this statement will be to require the
    Company to expand its disclosure regarding its derivative
    instruments, and will not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The

    the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the
    preparation of financial statements for nongovernmental entities
    that are presented in conformity with GAAP.
    SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following
    the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The
    Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles.” The Company does not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on
    its consolidated financial position, results of operations or

    No. 60.” The statement requires that an insurance
    entity recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default
    (insured event) when there is evidence that credit deterioration
    has occurred in an insured financial obligation.
    SFAS No. 163 also clarifies the application of
    SFAS No. 60 “Accounting and Reporting by
    Insurance Enterprises” to financial guarantee insurance
    contracts and expands disclosure requirements surrounding such
    contracts. SFAS No. 163 is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 163;
    however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the

    INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS AND LAND OPTION COST WRITE-OFFS

During fiscal 2008 the factors hurting demand for new homes grew
    in intensity and became more pervasive across the United States.
    As a result, the already difficult conditions within the
    homebuilding industry became progressively more challenging.
    High inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated
    cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates and overall weak
    consumer confidence persisted throughout the year. The effects
    of these factors were further magnified by credit tightening in
    the mortgage markets, increasing home foreclosures and severe
    shortages of liquidity in the financial markets. The liquidity
    shortage has caused concern about the viability of many
    financial institutions and has negatively impacted the already
    weakening economy which has created fears of a prolonged
    recession. These factors, combined with the Company’s
    disappointing sales results, further declines in sales order
    prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales
    revenues caused the Company’s outlook for the homebuilding
    industry and the impact on its business to remain cautious.

During fiscal 2008, when the Company performed its quarterly
    inventory impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized
    reflected its outlook for the homebuilding industry and the
    impact on its business. This outlook incorporates the
    Company’s belief that housing market conditions may
    continue to deteriorate, and that these challenging conditions
    will persist for some time. Accordingly, the Company’s
    impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2008 again
    indicated a significant number of communities with impairment
    indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of
    $2,186.2 million as of September 30, 2008, had
    indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for
    impairment. The analysis of each of these communities generally
    assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or
    lower than current sales order prices in each community or for
    comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable
    absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe
    for a given community in the current market conditions, the
    remaining lives of these communities was estimated to be in a
    range from six months to in excess of ten years. Through this
    evaluation process, it was determined that communities with a
    carrying value of $967.8 million as of September 30,
    2008, the largest portions of which were in the West and
    Southeast regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, impairment charges of
    $364.7 million were recorded to reduce the carrying value
    of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value.

Due to the significant decline in demand for new homes, the
    Company has reduced its expectations of future home closing
    volumes, as well as its expected need for land and lots in the
    future. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    the Company sold a significant amount of land and lots. In
    connection with these land and lot sales, impairment charges of
    $624.2 million were recorded to reduce the
    $814.4 million carrying value of this inventory to its net
    realizable value. Including impairments related to land sales,
    impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
    totaled $988.9 million, as compared to $278.3 million
    in the prior year period. The fourth quarter charges combined
    with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in
    total inventory impairment charges of $2,372.6 million in
    fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, impairment charges
    totaled $1,222.2 million and $146.2 million,
    respectively. The Company performs its impairment analysis based
    on total inventory at the community level. When an impairment
    charge for a community is determined, the charge is then
    allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as
    land and development costs are allocated to each lot. The
    inventory within each community is categorized as construction
    in progress and finished homes, residential land and
    lots — developed and under development, and land held
    for development, based on the stage of production or plans for
    future development. During fiscal 2008, excluding impairments
    related to land sales, approximately 79% of the impairment
    charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held
    for development, and approximately 21% of the charges were
    recorded to residential construction in progress and finished
    homes inventory, compared to 74% and 26%, respectively, in
    fiscal 2007.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At September 30, 2008, the Company had $39.4 million
    of land held for sale, consisting of land held for development
    and land under development that has met the criteria of
    available for sale in accordance with SFAS No. 144.

If conditions in the broader economy, homebuilding industry or
    specific markets in which the Company operates worsen beyond
    current expectations, and as the Company re-evaluates specific
    community pricing and incentives and land sale strategies, it
    may be required to evaluate additional communities or
    re-evaluate previously impaired communities for potential
    impairment. These evaluations may result in additional
    impairment charges, which could be material.

Based on a quarterly review of land and lot option contracts,
    the Company has written off earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to contracts which it no longer
    plans to pursue. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
    wrote off $111.9 million, $107.3 million and
    $124.7 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and
    pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts. Should
    the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and the
    Company is unable to successfully renegotiate certain land
    purchase contracts, it may write off additional earnest money
    deposits and pre-acquisition costs.

NOTE C —
    LAND INVENTORY NOT OWNED

In the ordinary course of its homebuilding business, the Company
    enters into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure
    land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option
    purchase contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in
    consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase
    land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms.
    Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of the
    option deposits are not refundable at the Company’s
    discretion.

Under the requirements of FIN 46R, certain of the
    Company’s option purchase contracts result in the creation
    of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel
    under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, the
    Company evaluates those land and lot option purchase contracts
    with variable interest entities to determine whether the Company
    is the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the
    variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity.
    Based on this evaluation, if the Company is the primary
    beneficiary of an entity with which the Company has entered into
    a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest
    entity is consolidated.

Since the Company owns no equity interest in any of the
    unaffiliated variable interest entities that it must consolidate
    pursuant to FIN 46R, the Company generally has little or no
    control or influence over the operations of these entities or
    their owners. When the Company’s requests for financial
    information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions
    about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required.
    In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated
    entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual
    purchase price of the land or lots the Company is purchasing. In
    these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt
    obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots the
    Company has the option to buy with a related offset to minority
    interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable
    interest entity.

The consolidation of these variable interest entities added
    $21.7 million and $65.8 million in land inventory not
    owned and minority interests related to entities not owned to
    the Company’s balance sheets at September 30, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The Company’s obligations related to
    these land or lot option contracts are guaranteed by cash
    deposits totaling $3.9 million and $11.3 million and
    promissory notes and surety bonds totaling $0.3 million and
    $0.5 million, as of September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest
    entities have no recourse against the Company.

For the variable interest entities which are unconsolidated
    because the Company is not subject to a majority of the risk of
    loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entities’
    residual returns, the maximum exposure to loss is generally
    limited to the amounts of the Company’s option deposits. At
    September 30, 2008, such exposure totaled
    $20.6 million.

Additionally, the Company evaluated land and lot option purchase
    contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 49,
    “Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements,” and
    added $16.9 million and $56.1 million in land
    inventory not owned, with a corresponding increase to accrued
    expenses and other liabilities, to the Company’s balance
    sheets at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a
    result of this evaluation.

Included in land inventory not owned at September 30, 2008,
    was $21.7 million of land for which the Company does not
    have title because the land was sold during the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2008. The recognition of these sales has been deferred
    because their terms, primarily related to the Company’s
    continuing involvement with the properties, did not meet the
    full accrual method criteria of SFAS No. 66.

NOTE D —
    GOODWILL

In performing its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of
    September 30, 2008, the Company estimated the fair value of
    its operating segments utilizing the present values of expected
    future cash flows, which were estimated based upon the
    challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry. As a
    result of this analysis, it was determined that the goodwill
    balance related to each operating segment in the Southwest
    reporting region was impaired. Consequently, during the fourth
    quarter, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
    $79.4 million.

As of September 30, 2008, the Company’s remaining
    goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of which related to
    its South Central reporting segment. As of September 30,
    2007, allocation of the Company’s remaining goodwill
    balance of $95.3 million was as follows: South Central
    $15.9 million and Southwest $79.4 million.

The goodwill assessment procedures of SFAS No. 142
    require management to make comprehensive estimates of future
    revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with
    such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates.

Homebuilding:

The Company has a $1.65 billion unsecured revolving credit
    facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit
    sub-facility. The revolving credit facility, which matures
    December 16, 2011, has an uncommitted accordion provision
    of $400 million which could be used to increase the size of
    the facility to $2.05 billion upon obtaining additional
    commitments from lenders. The Company’s borrowing capacity,
    including the issuance of letters of credit, under this facility
    is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding, and
    is further reduced by the limitations in effect under the
    borrowing base arrangement described below. The facility is
    guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s
    wholly-owned subsidiaries other than its financial services
    subsidiaries. Borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the
    London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon
    the Company’s ratio of homebuilding debt to total
    capitalization, its ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted
    interest incurred and its senior unsecured debt rating. At
    September 30, 2008, the Company had no cash borrowings and
    $71.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding on
    the homebuilding revolving credit facility. The interest rates
    of this facility at September 30, 2008 and 2007 were 5.5%
    and 6.0%, respectively. In addition to the stated interest
    rates, the revolving credit facility requires the Company to pay
    certain fees.

Under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit
    facility, if the Company has fewer than two investment grade
    senior unsecured debt ratings from Moody’s Investors
    Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor’s Ratings
    Services, it is subject to a borrowing base limitation and
    restrictions on unsold homes and residential land and lots.
    During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 both
    Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s downgraded the
    Company’s senior debt rating to below investment grade
    status; therefore, these additional limitations became effective
    and are currently in effect. During the third quarter of fiscal
    2008, the Company’s senior debt rating was downgraded by
    all three rating agencies, and on November 26, 2008, was
    further downgraded by Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s to their current levels as follows: Moody’s
    (Ba3); Standard & Poor’s (BB−); and Fitch
    (BB+).

Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of the
    Company’s senior debt and the amount drawn on the revolving
    credit facility may not exceed the lesser of (a) certain
    percentages of the acquisition cost of various categories of
    unencumbered inventory or (b) certain percentages of the
    book value of various categories of unencumbered inventory, cash
    and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2008, the borrowing
    base arrangement limited the Company’s additional borrowing
    capacity from any source, including the issuance of letters of
    credit, to $52.8 million.

In January 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement,
    the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from
    $2.5 billion to $2.25 billion. The amendment also
    revised certain financial covenants, including reducing the
    required level of minimum tangible net worth and reducing the
    maximum leverage ratio. Additionally, the amendment modified the
    adjusted EBITDA to adjusted interest incurred covenant such that
    it can no longer result in an event of default.

In June 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement, the
    size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from
    $2.25 billion to $1.65 billion. The amendment further
    reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and modified
    the leverage ratio calculation to allow all cash in excess of
    $50 million to be deducted from notes payable. In addition,
    the amendment increased the maximum residential land and lots to
    tangible net worth ratio and modified tangible net worth to
    include certain capital stock. The amendment also changed the
    pricing terms of the revolving credit facility, whereby the
    interest rate spread on borrowings and on unused committed
    capacity was increased.

All series of senior notes and borrowings under the revolving
    credit facility are senior obligations of the Company and rank

pari passu

in right of payment to all existing and future
    unsecured indebtedness of the Company, and senior to all
    existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated to them.
    The senior subordinated notes rank behind all existing and
    future senior notes and bank credit facilities. Both the senior
    and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially
    all of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries other than
    its financial services subsidiaries. Upon a change of control of
    the Company, holders of all series of notes issued prior to
    October 2004, constituting $1.6 billion principal amount in
    the aggregate as of September 30, 2008, have the right to
    require the Company to redeem such notes at a price of 101% of
    the par amount, along with accrued and unpaid interest.

On December 1, 2007, the Company repaid the
    $215 million principal amount of its 7.5% senior notes
    which became due on that date.

In February 2008, through an unsolicited transaction, the
    Company repurchased $36.5 million principal amount of its
    9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase
    price of $36.0 million, plus accrued interest. The gain of
    $0.5 million is included in homebuilding other income in
    the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2008.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In May 2008, the Company commenced an offer to exchange any and
    all of its outstanding 9.75% senior subordinated notes due
    2010 for an equal principal amount of new 9.75% senior
    notes due 2010. In conjunction with the exchange offer, the
    Company solicited consents to an amendment to the indenture
    governing the senior subordinated notes that would eliminate
    many of the restrictive covenants applicable to the senior
    subordinated notes. For each $1,000 principal amount of senior
    subordinated notes tendered prior to the expiration of the
    consent solicitation on June 4, 2008, holders received a
    consent payment of $10. On June 20, 2008, the exchange
    offer and related solicitation of consents to amend the
    indenture closed, with $96.8 million principal amount of
    the senior subordinated notes having been tendered for exchange,
    and $16.7 million principal amount of the 9.75% senior
    subordinated notes remaining under the amended indenture. As a
    result of the amendment to the indenture, many of the
    restrictive covenants contained in the indenture were eliminated.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, through unsolicited
    transactions, the Company repurchased $35.3 million
    principal amount of its 8% senior notes due 2009 at their
    face value, plus accrued interest, and $1.40 million
    principal amount of its 9.75% senior subordinated notes due
    2010 for a purchase price of $1.36 million, plus accrued
    interest.

In November 2008, through unsolicited transactions, the Company
    repurchased a total of $102.9 million principal amount of
    various issues of its senior notes due in 2009 and 2010 for an
    aggregate purchase price of $98.2 million.

In November 2007, the Board of Directors extended its
    authorization for the repurchase of up to $500 million of
    the Company’s outstanding debt securities to
    November 30, 2008. At September 30, 2008,
    $426.8 million of the authorization was remaining. Upon
    expiration of the November 2007 authorization, the Board of
    Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to
    $500 million of debt securities. The new authorization is
    effective from December 1, 2008 to November 30, 2009.

The revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on the
    Company’s operations and activities by requiring the
    Company to maintain certain levels of leverage, tangible net
    worth and components of inventory. If the Company does not
    maintain the requisite levels, it may not be able to pay
    dividends or available financing could be reduced or terminated.
    In addition, the indentures governing the Company’s senior
    notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the
    creation of secured debt.

At September 30, 2008, the Company was in compliance with
    all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a
    part of the bank revolving credit facility and the public debt
    obligations. However, the Company’s continued borrowing
    availability depends on its ability to remain in compliance with
    these covenants, limitations and restrictions. If it appears
    that the Company will not be able to comply with these
    requirements in the future, it could be more difficult and
    expensive to maintain the current level of financing or obtain
    additional financing.

Financial
    Services:

The Company’s mortgage subsidiary had a $540 million
    mortgage warehouse loan facility that matured March 28,
    2008, and a $600 million commercial paper conduit facility
    (the “CP conduit facility”) that was voluntarily
    terminated effective April 1, 2008 by agreement of the
    parties. These facilities were replaced with the mortgage
    repurchase facility described below.

On March 28, 2008, DHI Mortgage entered into a mortgage
    sale and repurchase agreement (the “mortgage repurchase
    facility”), that matures March 26, 2009. The mortgage
    repurchase facility, which replaced the mortgage warehouse loan
    facility, provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by
    facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage
    transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the
    transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming
    purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
    to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third party
    investors in the secondary

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market or upon a specified time per the terms of the mortgage
    repurchase facility. As of September 30, 2008,
    $333.7 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged
    under this repurchase arrangement. The mortgage repurchase
    facility is accounted for as a secured financing. The facility
    has a capacity of $275 million, subject to an accordion
    feature that could increase the total capacity to
    $500 million based on obtaining increased commitments from
    existing counterparties, new commitments from prospective
    counterparties, or a combination of both. In addition, DHI
    Mortgage has the option to fund a portion of its repurchase
    obligations in advance. As a result of advance fundings totaling
    $106.9 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of
    $203.5 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase
    facility at September 30, 2008 at a 4.9% interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either
    D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee the
    Company’s homebuilding debt. The facility contains
    financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary’s minimum
    required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt
    to tangible net worth, its minimum required net income and its
    minimum required liquidity. At September 30, 2008, the
    mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions
    and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, the Company has been able to renew or extend its
    mortgage credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their
    maturities, and obtain temporary additional commitments through
    amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of
    higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The
    recent volatility in the credit markets and losses sustained by
    many banks will likely make renewing this facility more
    challenging and more expensive. The liquidity of the
    Company’s financial services business depends upon its
    continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase
    facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient
    capacities.

NOTE F —
    MORTGAGE LOANS

To manage the interest rate risk inherent in its mortgage
    operations, the Company hedges its risk using various derivative
    instruments, which include forward sales of mortgage-backed
    securities (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put
    options on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the
    term “hedging instruments” in the following discussion
    refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination.
    The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading
    or speculative purposes.

Mortgage
    Loans Held for Sale

Mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single-family
    residential loans collateralized by the underlying property.
    Newly originated loans that have been closed but not committed
    to a third-party investor are matched with hedging instruments
    that are designated as fair value hedges. Hedged loans are
    committed to third-party investors typically within three days
    of origination. Loans held for sale are carried at cost that is
    adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation
    of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale
    commitments or current market quotes. During the years ended
    September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had net
    gains on sales of loans of $69.1 million,
    $97.8 million, and $145.5 million, respectively.

Some loans are sold with limited recourse provisions. Based on
    historical experience and current housing and credit market
    conditions, the Company has estimated and recorded a total loss
    reserve predominantly for mortgage loans held in portfolio and
    mortgage loans held for sale of $30.5 million and
    $24.6 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The notional amounts of the hedging instruments used to hedge
    mortgage loans held for sale can vary in relationship to the
    underlying loan amounts, depending on the typical movements in
    the value of each hedging instrument relative to the value of
    the underlying mortgage loans. As of September 30, 2008,
    the Company



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

had $80.7 million in loans not committed to third-party
    investors and hedging instruments related to those loans
    totaling $205.7 million.

The hedging instruments associated with uncommitted, funded
    loans are typically designated as fair value hedges of the risk
    of changes in the overall fair value of the related loans.
    Accordingly, changes in the value of the derivative instruments
    are recognized in current earnings, as are changes in the value
    of the loans. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s net gains related to the
    ineffective portion of its fair value hedging instruments were
    insignificant, and at September 30, 2008 there were no
    designated accounting hedges. The net changes in fair value are
    included in financial services revenues.

Loan
    Commitments

To meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is
    party to interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) which are
    extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet
    certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. The Company
    accounts for its IRLCs in accordance with SFAS No. 133
    and SAB 109 as described in Note A. The adoption of
    SAB 109 in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and its
    required valuation of the IRLCs resulted in the recognition of
    an additional $8.8 million of revenues during fiscal 2008.
    At September 30, 2008, the Company’s IRLCs totaled
    $225.3 million.

The Company manages interest rate risk related to its IRLCs
    through the use of best-efforts whole loan delivery commitments
    and hedging instruments as described above. These instruments
    are considered non-designated derivatives and are accounted for
    at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current
    earnings. As of September 30, 2008, the Company had
    approximately $31.8 million of best-efforts whole loan
    delivery commitments and $417.6 million outstanding of
    hedging instruments related to its IRLCs not yet committed to
    investors.

The Company also purchases forward rate agreements (FRAs) and
    economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to
    potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on
    their home financing. At September 30, 2008, these
    potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately
    $79.8 million and were hedged with economic interest rate
    hedges of $1,068.9 million in EDFC put options and
    $34.3 million in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and
    economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not
    exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered
    non-designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value
    with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. These
    gains and losses for the years ended September 30, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 were not significant.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
    requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax
    assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not
    be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation
    allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically by
    the Company based on the SFAS No. 109
    more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. In the
    assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration
    is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the
    realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment
    considers, among other matters, the taxable income available in
    current statutory carryback periods; reversals of existing
    taxable

    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

temporary differences; tax planning strategies; the nature,
    frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses; the
    duration of statutory carryforward periods; the Company’s
    historical experience in generating operating profits; and
    expectations for future profitability. In making such judgments,
    significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively
    verified. SFAS No. 109 provides that a cumulative loss
    in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering
    whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts
    the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income
    to support the recovery of deferred tax assets.

Due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding
    industry during the past two years, the Company has recorded
    significant impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill
    and is in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position for
    fiscal years 2006 through 2008. While the Company has a long
    history of profitable operations prior to the current downturn
    in the homebuilding industry, the cumulative loss position is
    significant negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of
    the Company’s deferred tax assets. Therefore, the Company
    recorded a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets,
    representing those deferred tax asset amounts for which ultimate
    realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
    income during the periods in which the related temporary
    differences become deductible. The remaining deferred tax assets
    of $213.5 million for which there are no valuation
    allowances relate to amounts that are expected to be primarily
    realized through net operating loss carrybacks to tax year
    ending September 30, 2007.

The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of
    future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual
    outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
    or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also
    affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets over time. At September 30, 2008, the Company had
    tax benefits for state net operating loss carryforwards of
    $60.0 million that expire (beginning at various times
    depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal 2013 to fiscal
    2028.

During fiscal 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, the
    Company sold a significant amount of land and lots through
    numerous transactions to generate cash flows, reduce future
    carrying costs and land development obligations, and lower the
    Company’s inventory supply in certain markets to match its
    expectations of future demand. These transactions, combined with
    the results of all of the Company’s operations in the
    current difficult housing environment, generated a net operating
    tax loss that can be carried back to fiscal 2006 and will result
    in a federal income tax refund. Consequently, the Company
    recorded a $676.2 million federal income tax receivable
    relating to the net operating loss carryback refund claim at
    September 30, 2008.

On October 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
    FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
    disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken on a tax return, including the minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. The cumulative
    effect of adopting FIN 48 had no impact on the
    Company’s beginning retained earnings. Effective with the
    Company’s adoption of FIN 48, interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the
    financial statements as a component of the income tax provision.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were
    previously included in interest expense and in selling, general
    and administrative expense, respectively. During fiscal 2008,
    the Company recognized interest and penalties of
    $4.0 million in its consolidated statement of operations,
    and at September 30, 2008, the Company’s total

All tax positions, if recognized, would affect the

    expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to
    significantly decrease or increase within twelve months of the
    current reporting date.

The Company is subject to federal income tax and to income tax
    in multiple states. The Internal Revenue Service is currently
    examining the Company’s fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and the
    Company is being audited by various states. The statute of
    limitations for the Company’s major tax jurisdictions
    remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2008.

In fiscal 2008, the provision for income taxes was
    $1.8 million, which reflects the effect of the
    establishment of the valuation allowance as discussed above. In
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded a benefit from income
    taxes of $238.7 million and a provision for income taxes of
    $753.8 million, respectively. The difference between income
    tax expense and tax computed by applying the federal statutory
    income tax rate of 35% to income (loss) before income taxes
    during each year is due to the following:

    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

At September 30, 2008, the Company had
    320,315,508 shares of Common Stock issued and
    316,660,275 shares outstanding. No shares of Preferred
    Stock were issued or outstanding. At September 30, 2008,
    the Company had 39.4 million and 4.1 million shares of
    Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the D.R. Horton,
    Inc. Stock Incentive Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
    respectively.

The Company has an automatically effective universal shelf
    registration statement registering debt and equity securities
    that it may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined.
    Also, at September 30, 2008, the Company had the capacity
    to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock
    under its acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect,
    in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions.

In November 2007, the Board of Directors extended its
    authorization for the repurchase of up to $463.2 million of
    the Company’s common stock to November 30, 2008. The
    Company made no repurchases of its common stock under the share
    repurchase program during fiscal 2008, and therefore, all of the
    $463.2 million authorization was remaining at
    September 30, 2008. Upon expiration of the November 2007
    authorization, the Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. The
    new authorization is effective from December 1, 2008 to
    November 30, 2009.

During fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors approved two
    quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share followed by
    two quarterly cash dividends of $0.075 per common share, the
    last of which was paid on August 28, 2008 to stockholders
    of record on August 18, 2008. Cash dividends of $0.15 per
    common share were paid in each quarter of fiscal 2007. On
    November 20, 2008, the Board of Directors approved a cash
    dividend of $0.0375 per common share, payable on
    December 18, 2008, to stockholders of record on
    December 8, 2008.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred
    Compensation

The Company has a 401(k) plan for all Company employees who have
    been with the Company for a period of six months or more. The
    Company matches portions of employees’ voluntary
    contributions. Additional employer contributions in the form of
    profit sharing are at the discretion of the Company. Expenses
    for the plan were $3.5 million, $12.2 million and
    $12.5 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Expenses were lower in fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of the
    use of forfeitures of unvested Company matching contributions by
    terminated employees.

The Company’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
    is a non-qualified deferred compensation program that provides
    benefits payable to certain management employees upon
    retirement, death, or termination of employment with the
    Company. Under the SERP, the Company accrues an unfunded benefit
    based on a percentage of the eligible employees’ salaries,
    as well as an interest factor based upon a predetermined
    formula. The Company’s liabilities related to the SERP were
    $12.2 million and $10.5 million at September 30,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company recorded
    $2.1 million, $2.0 million and $1.9 million of
    expense for this plan in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan available to a
    select group of employees. The participating employees designate
    investments for their contributions; however, the Company is not
    required to invest the contributions in the designated
    investments. The Company’s net liabilities related to the
    deferred compensation plan were $42.1 million and
    $80.3 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Company records as expense the amount that the
    employee contributions would have earned had the funds been
    invested in the designated investments. The Company recorded a
    credit to expense of $5.1 million and charges to expense of
    $13.0 million and $7.5 million for this plan in fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides
    eligible employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of
    the Company at a discounted price of at least 85% of the fair
    market value of the stock on the designated dates of purchase.
    The price may be further discounted depending on the average
    fair market value of the stock during the period and certain
    other criteria. Under the terms of the plan, the total fair
    market value of the common stock that an eligible employee may
    purchase each year is limited to the lesser of 15% of the
    employee’s annual compensation or $25,000. Under the plan,
    employees of the Company purchased 168,194 shares for
    $2.0 million in fiscal 2008, 156,543 shares for
    $3.5 million in fiscal 2007 and 158,444 shares for
    $4.5 million in fiscal 2006.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the
    granting of stock options to certain key employees of the
    Company to purchase shares of common stock. Options are granted
    at exercise prices which equal the market value of the
    Company’s common stock at the date of the grant. Generally,
    the options vest over periods of 5 to 9.75 years and expire
    10 years after the dates on which they were granted.

During fiscal 2008, stock options were granted to purchase a
    total of 6.5 million shares of the Company’s common
    stock at the closing market price of the stock on the date of
    the grant. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s
    Board of Directors granted all such stock options to the
    Company’s executive officers, other officers and certain of
    its employees, and the Company’s Board of Directors granted
    all such stock options to its outside directors. At
    September 30, 2008, there were 23.8 million shares
    available for future grants under the Plan.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based
    Payment,” the Company measures and recognizes compensation
    expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
    payments granted under

For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s compensation
    expense related to stock option grants was $13.5 million,
    $12.4 million and $11.8 million, respectively, and at
    September 30, 2008, there was $61.9 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock
    option awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 6.5 years.

Incentive
    Bonus Plan

In December 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors approved an amendment and restatement to the
    Company’s 2000 Incentive Bonus Plan, which was approved by
    the stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting held in
    January 2008. The restated plan changes the maximum award limits
    payable under the plan from a performance-based formula tied to
    the Company’s fiscal year to a combination of a formula
    based upon the actual performance period established under the
    plan and a fixed dollar amount. Performance periods may be based
    on one or more months, quarters or years, although no covered
    employee may receive both a monthly or quarterly award and an
    annual award with respect to the same fiscal year. At
    September 30, 2008, the Company had $2.0 million
    accrued related to the Incentive Bonus Plan.

Performance
    Unit Plan

In December 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors adopted the Company’s 2008 Performance Unit Plan,
    which was approved by the stockholders at the Company’s
    annual meeting held in January 2008. The Performance Unit Plan
    provides for the Compensation Committee to grant performance
    units to senior management based upon the level of achievement
    of certain criteria. Each performance unit awarded will have a
    value equal to the closing stock price of the Company’s
    common stock at the end of the performance period and may be
    paid in cash, equity or a combination of both.

During fiscal 2008, the Company issued long-term performance
    awards that vest on September 30, 2010. These awards can be
    adjusted based on the Company’s performance relative to its
    peers in return on investment and in net sales gains percentage.
    The percentage of units that vest depends on the Company’s
    relative position as compared to its peers at the end of the
    performance period and can range from 0% to 200% of the number
    of units granted. The Company’s liability for awards
    granted during fiscal 2008 was $3.6 million at
    September 30, 2008, representing the aggregate value of the
    awards on that date. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), these awards are accounted for as
    liability awards for which compensation expense is recognized
    over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in accrued
    liabilities.

NOTE K —
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are
    based on quoted market prices, where available, or are
    estimated. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in
    time based on relevant market information and information about
    the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in
    nature, involve matters of judgment and therefore, cannot be
    determined with precision. Estimated fair values are
    significantly

affected by the assumptions used. The Company’s methods and
    assumptions used in estimating fair values are described below.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    payable, accrued expenses, the revolving credit facility, the
    mortgage warehouse facility, the commercial paper conduit
    facility and other secured notes payable as reported in the
    Company’s balance sheets approximate their fair values due
    to their short maturity or floating interest rate terms, as
    applicable.

For the senior and senior subordinated notes, fair values
    represent quoted market prices. For mortgage loans held for
    sale, forward sales of mortgage-backed securities and interest
    rate lock commitments, the fair values are estimated based on
    quoted market prices for similar financial instruments. The
    following table sets forth the carrying values and estimated
    fair values of the Company’s senior and senior subordinated
    notes, mortgage loans held for sale, forward sales of

NOTE L —
    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company has been named as defendant in various claims,
    complaints and other legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. Management believes that, while the outcome
    of such contingencies cannot be predicted with certainty, the
    liabilities arising from these matters will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. However, to the
    extent the liability arising from the ultimate resolution of any
    matter exceeds management’s estimates reflected in the
    recorded reserves relating to these matters, the Company could
    incur additional charges that could be significant.

The Company has established reserves for contingencies occurring
    in the ordinary course of business, including warranty and
    construction defect claims on closed homes and the expected
    costs of the self-insured portion of general liability and
    workers compensation insurance claims. The Company’s
    estimates of such reserves are based on the facts and
    circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data
    and trends, including costs relative to revenues, home closings
    and product types, and include estimates of the costs of
    unreported claims related to past operations. These reserve
    estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances
    of individual pending claims and historical data and trends
    change. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the
    accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs. The
    Company’s total liabilities for such items were
    $366.9 million and $387.0 million at
    September 30, 2008 and 2007,

respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

On June 15, 2007, a putative class action,

John R.
    Yeatman, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.,

was filed
    by one of the Company’s customers against it and its
    affiliated mortgage company subsidiary in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The
    complaint sought certification of a class alleged to include
    persons who, within the year preceding the filing of the suit,
    purchased a home from the Company and obtained a mortgage for
    such purchase from its affiliated mortgage company subsidiary.
    The complaint alleged that the Company violated Section 8
    of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by effectively
    requiring its homebuyers to use its affiliated mortgage company
    to finance their home purchases by offering certain discounts
    and incentives. The action sought damages in an unspecified
    amount and injunctive relief. On April 23, 2008, the Court
    ruled on the Company’s motion to dismiss and dismissed this
    complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a notice of
    appeal, which is currently pending.

On March 24, 2008, a putative class action,

James
    Wilson, et al. v. D.R. Horton, Inc., et al.,

was filed
    by five customers of Western Pacific Housing, Inc., one of the
    Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, against the Company,
    Western Pacific Housing, Inc., and the Company’s affiliated
    mortgage company subsidiary, in the United States District Court
    for the Southern District of California. The complaint seeks
    certification of a class alleged to include persons who, within
    the four years preceding the filing of the suit, purchased a
    home from the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, and obtained
    a mortgage for such purchase from the Company’s affiliated
    mortgage company subsidiary. The complaint alleges that the
    Company violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and
    Sections 16720, 17200 and 17500 of the California Business
    and Professions Code by effectively requiring its homebuyers to
    apply for a loan through its affiliated mortgage company. The
    complaint alleges that the homebuyers were either deceived about
    loan costs charged by the Company’s affiliated mortgage
    company or coerced into using its affiliated mortgage company,
    or both, and that discounts and incentives offered by the
    Company or its subsidiaries to buyers who obtained financing
    from its affiliated mortgage company were illusory. The action
    seeks treble damages in an unspecified amount and injunctive
    relief. Management believes the claims alleged in this action
    are without merit and will defend them vigorously. However, as
    the action is still in its early stages, the Company is unable
    to express an opinion as to the likelihood of an unfavorable
    outcome or the amount of damages, if any. Consequently, the
    Company has not recorded any liabilities for damages in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into land
    and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or
    lots for the construction of homes. At September 30, 2008,
    the Company had total deposits of $50.9 million, comprised
    of cash deposits of $44.8 million, promissory notes of
    $3.3 million, and letters of credit and surety bonds of
    $2.8 million, to purchase land and lots with a total
    remaining purchase price of $732.3 million. Within the land
    and lot option purchase contracts in force at September 30,
    2008, there were a limited number of contracts, representing
    only $48.0 million of remaining purchase price, subject to
    specific performance clauses which may require the Company to
    purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their
    obligations.

Included in the total deposits of $50.9 million, were
    $23.4 million of deposits related to land and lot option
    purchase contracts for which the Company does not expect to
    exercise its option to purchase the land or lots, but the
    contract has not yet been terminated. The remaining purchase
    price of those contracts was $247.9 million. Consequently,
    the deposits relating to these contracts have been written off,
    resulting in a net deposit balance of $27.5 million at
    September 30, 2008. The majority of land and lots under
    contract are currently expected to be purchased within three
    years, based on the Company’s assumptions as to the extent
    it will exercise its options to purchase such land and lots.

Additionally, in the normal course of its business activities,
    the Company provides standby letters of credit and surety bonds,
    issued by third parties, to secure performance under various
    contracts. At September 30, 2008, outstanding standby
    letters of credit were $71.6 million and surety bonds were

$1.6 billion. The Company has additional capacity of
    $928.4 million for standby letters of credit under its
    revolving credit facility, subject to the borrowing base
    limitation of $52.8 million as discussed in Note E.

The Company leases office space and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases. Minimum annual lease payments

NOTE M —
    SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s 34 homebuilding operating divisions and its
    financial services operation are its operating segments under
    SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information.” As reflected in the
    current year presentation, the homebuilding operating segments
    are aggregated into six reporting segments and the financial
    services operating segment is its own reporting segment.
    Previously, the Company presented seven homebuilding reporting
    segments, based on its seven operating regions which had been
    determined to be its operating segments. During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company reassessed the level at
    which the SFAS No. 131 operating segment criteria is
    met, and as a result, changed its operating segments from the
    operating regions to the operating divisions. This determination
    was based on changes to the Company’s management structure
    and decision-making processes, which have evolved primarily due
    to the difficult market conditions and the decrease in size of
    the Company’s operations.

As a result of the change in operating segments described above,
    the composition of the Company’s reporting segments was
    also revised. The California markets, which were previously
    presented as a separate reporting segment are now included in
    the West reporting segment. Additionally, the Salt Lake City,
    Utah market, which was previously included in the Southwest
    reporting segment, is now included in the West reporting
    segment. Furthermore, the name of the Northeast reporting
    segment has been changed to the East reporting segment, although
    the markets comprising it remain the same.

Under the revised presentation, the Company’s reportable
    homebuilding segments are: East, Midwest, Southeast, South
    Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have
    homebuilding operations located in the following states:

East:

Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North
    Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia

Midwest:

Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Southeast:

Alabama, Florida and Georgia

South Central:

Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas

Southwest:

Arizona and New Mexico

West:

California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington

Consequently, the Company has restated the prior year segment
    information provided in this note to conform to the current year
    presentation.



D.R.
    HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Homebuilding is the Company’s core business, generating 98%
    of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. The
    Company’s homebuilding segments are primarily engaged in
    the acquisition and development of land for residential purposes
    and the construction and sale of residential homes on such land,
    in 27 states and 77 markets in the United States. The
    homebuilding segments generate most of their revenues from the
    sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of
    land and lots.

The Company’s financial services segment provides mortgage
    financing and title agency services principally to customers of
    the Company’s homebuilding segments. The Company generally
    does not retain or service the mortgages that it originates,
    but, rather, seeks to sell the mortgages and related servicing
    rights to investors. The financial services segment generates
    its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and
    collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services.

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are described
    throughout Note A.

In the past, the Company experienced variability in its results
    of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature
    of its homebuilding business. Historically, the Company has
    closed a greater number of homes in the third and fourth (June
    and September) fiscal quarters than in the first and second
    (December and March) fiscal quarters. As a result, revenues and
    net income typically have been higher in the third and fourth
    quarters of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2007 and 2008, however,
    due to difficult market conditions in most of the markets in
    which the Company operates, approximately half of its
    consolidated revenues were attributable to operations in the
    third and fourth fiscal quarters, and the Company incurred
    consolidated operating losses in those quarters of fiscal 2007
    and in all quarters of fiscal 2008.

Gross profit during fiscal 2008 was reduced by inventory
    impairment charges of $243.5 million, $817.1 million,
    $323.2 million and $988.9 million, and write-offs of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs of
    $2.0 million, $17.0 million, $7.2 million and
    $85.7 million in the first, second, third and fourth
    quarters, respectively.

Gross profit during fiscal 2007 was reduced by inventory
    impairment charges of $40.9 million, $67.3 million,
    $835.8 million and $278.3 million, and write-offs of
    earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs of
    $36.8 million, $13.9 million, $16.2 million and
    $40.3 million in the first, second, third and fourth
    quarters, respectively.

Goodwill impairment charges of $79.4 million were recorded
    as a reduction of income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
    Goodwill impairment charges of $425.6 million and
    $48.5 million were recorded as a reduction of income in the
    third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, respectively.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The provision for income taxes of $421.0 million in the
    second quarter of fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of the
    Company’s recording of a $385 million valuation
    allowance to the deferred tax assets existing as of the
    beginning of the fiscal year. The benefit from income taxes of
    $365.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was
    primarily the result of generating a larger net operating tax
    loss than previously anticipated from the land and lots sold in
    the fourth quarter. The net operating tax loss can be carried
    back to fiscal 2006 and resulted in a reduction of the valuation
    allowance.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
    evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that
    evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
    reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
    in the reports the Company files, furnishes, submits or
    otherwise provides the Securities and Exchange Commission under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed
    in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the CEO and CFO, in such a manner as to allow timely
    decisions regarding the required disclosure.

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
    September 30, 2008 that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal
    control over financial reporting is a process to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
    limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
    prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
    concluded that the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2008.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2008,
    as stated in their report included herein.
