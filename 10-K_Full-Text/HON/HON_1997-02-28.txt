                                    PART I.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
     AlliedSignal  Inc. (with its consolidated  subsidiaries referred to in this
Report as the  Company) was  organized in  the State  of Delaware  in 1985.  The
Company is the successor to Allied Corporation, which was organized in the State
of New York in 1920.
 
     AlliedSignal  is an  advanced technology and  manufacturing company serving
customers worldwide with aerospace  and automotive products, chemicals,  fibers,
plastics  and advanced materials.  The Company's operations  are conducted under
three business segments: Aerospace, Automotive and Engineered Materials.
 
AEROSPACE
 
     The Aerospace  segment  is  among the  world's  largest  manufacturers  and
suppliers  of  advanced  technology  products  and  services  for  the military,
commercial and general aviation, and space markets.
 
     Following is a description of the major Aerospace businesses:
 

 
 


 

 
 


 

 
     The Aerospace segment serves key military and commercial components of  the
aviation,  defense and space markets with  a broad array of systems, subsystems,
components  and  services.  It  designs,  develops,  manufactures,  markets  and
services hundreds of products found on all types of aircraft, from single-piston
engine aircraft, business aircraft and wide-bodied 'jumbos' flown by the world's
commercial  airlines, to trainers, transports, bombers, fighters and helicopters
used by the U.S. and other countries for national defense. The Company's  global
business  consists primarily of  original equipment (OE)  sales and an extensive
aftermarket  business,  including  spare  parts,  maintenance  and  repair,  and
retrofitting.  Worldwide customers include the U.S. and foreign governments, all
of the  major airframe  and engine  manufacturers, including  Boeing,  McDonnell
Douglas,  Lockheed  Martin,  Airbus  Industrie,  Aero  International (Regional),
Raytheon, Israeli  Aircraft  Industries, Northrop  Grumman,  British  Aerospace,
Cessna,    Fairchild/Dornier,   Dassault,   Gulfstream,   Bombardier,   Rockwell
International, Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls-Royce, as well as the
world's leading airlines  and business  aircraft and  general aviation  aircraft
operators,  and  dealers  and  distributors of  general  aviation  products. The
Company  also  provides  field  engineering  management  and  technical  support
services  to Boeing, the  National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA),
the U.S.  Department of  Defense (DoD),  the U.S.  Department of  Energy,  other
federal  civilian  agencies as  well as  state and  local governments  and other
commercial entities.
 
     The Company is affected by  U.S. Government budget constraints for  defense
and  space programs as well  as the level of  production of commercial, business
and general aviation aircraft  which are impacted by  business cycles and  world
economic  conditions. Growth in the  Company's commercial business for aerospace
products is expected,  over the long  term, to help  mitigate the reductions  in
U.S.  defense spending. Moreover,  aerospace sales are not  dependent on any one
key defense program or commercial customer. However, contract awards by aircraft
manufacturers can  be canceled  or  reduced if  aircraft  orders are  cut  back.
Aerospace's  products and services are sold in competition with those of a large
number of other companies,  some of which  have substantial financial  resources
and significant technological capabilities.
 
     In  1996, world defense spending flattened  after declining in prior years.
The Company  believes that  the cyclical  downturn for  the commercial  aircraft
industry  reached bottom in  1995. A slight  improvement was seen  in the second
half of 1996 and  this growth is expected  to significantly accelerate in  1997.
Most  major U.S.  and international airlines  operated in  an improving economic
 
 


environment. The modest turnaround  for the airline industry  that began in  the
second  half of 1993,  continued in 1994 and  strengthened significantly in 1995
and 1996.  The  regional airlines  experienced  strong traffic  growth  and  new
regional  aircraft orders  were higher in  1996. The  high-end business aviation
market showed moderate  growth and  the commercial aftermarket  spare parts  and
repair and overhaul business showed strong growth during 1996.
 
     Sales  to the U.S.  Government, acting through  its various departments and
agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $1,833 million for 1996  and
$1,806  million for 1995, which  includes sales to the  DoD of $1,237 million in
1996 and $1,205 million in 1995. Approximately 55% and 54% of sales to the  U.S.
Government in 1996 and 1995, respectively, were made under fixed-price contracts
in  which the Company agrees to perform a contract for a fixed price and retains
for itself  any  benefits of  cost  savings or  must  bear the  burden  of  cost
overruns.
 
     Government   contracts  and,   in  general,   subcontracts  thereunder  are
terminable, in  whole  or  in  part,  for default  or  for  convenience  by  the
government or the higher level contractor if deemed in their best interest. Upon
termination   for   convenience,  the   contractor   is  normally   entitled  to
reimbursement for allowable costs  and to an allowance  for profit. However,  if
the  contract is terminated because of  the contractor's default, the contractor
may not recover all of its costs and may be liable for any excess costs incurred
by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source.
 
     In addition  to  the  right  of the  government  to  terminate,  government
contracts  are  conditioned upon  the  continuing availability  of Congressional
appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis  even
though  contract performance  may extend over  many years.  Consequently, at the
outset of  a  program,  the  prime contract  is  usually  partially  funded  and
additional  funds are normally only appropriated  to the contract by Congress in
future years.  Fixed-price  subcontracts  are normally  fully  funded,  but  are
subject to convenience termination if the prime contract is not funded.
 
     The  Company, as are other government contractors, is subject to government
investigations of business practices and compliance with government  procurement
regulations.  Although  such  regulations  provide  that  a  contractor  may  be
suspended or debarred from government contracts under certain circumstances, and
the outcome  of  pending  government investigations  cannot  be  predicted  with
certainty,  management is not currently aware of any such investigations that it
expects will have  a material adverse  effect on the  Company. In addition,  the
Company  carries out proactive compliance programs focused on areas of potential
exposure.
 
     Orders for  certain  products  sold  to  general  and  commercial  aviation
customers  mainly  consist  of  relatively  short-term  and  frequently  renewed
commitments. Government procurement agencies generally issue contracts  covering
relatively  long periods  of time. Total  backlog for products  and services for
both government and commercial contracts was $4,514 million at December 31, 1996
and $4,523 million  at December 31,  1995 of which  U.S. and foreign  government
orders  were $1,906  million and  $1,871 million  for the  respective years. The
Company anticipates that approximately $3,562 million of the total 1996  backlog
will be filled during 1997.
 
     The  Aerospace  segment's  international  operations  consist  primarily of
exporting U.S. manufactured products and  systems, performance of services  that
include  operating  aircraft  repair  and  overhaul  facilities,  and  licensing
activities. The  principal manufacturing  facility  outside of  the U.S.  is  in
Canada.
 
AUTOMOTIVE
 
     The  Automotive  segment designs,  engineers, manufactures  and distributes
systems and  components  for  worldwide vehicle  manufacturers  and  aftermarket
customers.
 
     Following is a description of the major Automotive businesses:
 

 
 


 

 
     On  April 12,  1996, the Company sold  a major  component of its  worldwide
braking business to Robert Bosch Gmbh, a privately held German company, for $1.5
billion in cash, subject to certain post-closing  adjustments.  Included in  the
sale were the worldwide light-vehicle and medium-heavy
 
 



truck hydraulic  braking and ABS businesses.  These businesses had 1995 sales of
approximately  $2.0  billion.  Excluded from  the  sale were  the brake friction
materials  business, brake-related sales  to the independent aftermarket and the
truck  brake systems business which is part of a joint venture with Knorr-Bremse
AG of Germany.
 
     In February 1997, the Company and  Knorr-Bremse AG, agreed in principle  to
purchase the heavy-truck air brake systems business of Echlin Inc. in the United
States  and Europe, as  well as Echlin's  U.S.-based commercial vehicle friction
materials and aftermarket brake shoe  relining operations. The businesses to  be
acquired  have sales of about $320  million. The proposed acquisition is subject
to review by government agencies in the U.S. and Europe.
 
     Automotive operations are located in  the U.S., Australia, Brazil,  Canada,
China,  France, Germany, India,  Ireland, Italy, Japan,  Malaysia, Mexico, South
Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom. Distribution and marketing are conducted in
these and numerous other countries as well. The segment's operations outside the
U.S. are conducted through various foreign  companies in which it has  interests
ranging  from minor to  complete control. International  operations also include
the  exporting  of   U.S.  manufactured  products   and  licensing   activities.
Internationally, products are marketed under the Bendix, Fram, Autolite, Garrett
and Jurid trademarks.
 
     Excluding  the impact  of the  divested braking  business from  both years,
worldwide passenger car and truck OE  sales accounted for approximately 50%  and
48% in 1996 and 1995, respectively, of the total sales of the Automotive segment
with aftermarket sales, including OES sales, accounting for the balance. In 1996
and 1995, Automotive operations outside the U.S. accounted for $1,583 and $1,531
million,  respectively, or 43%  in both years, of  total Automotive sales. Total
worldwide sales  for 1996  and 1995  to the  Company's five  largest  automotive
manufacturing  customers amounted to $1,099 and  $1,016 million, or 30% and 28%,
respectively, of total Automotive sales.
 
     The Automotive segment's products are sold in highly competitive markets to
customers who demand performance, quality and competitive prices. Virtually  all
automotive  components are sold in  competition with other independent suppliers
or with the captive component divisions of the vehicle manufacturers. While  the
Company's  competitive position varies among  its products, the Company believes
it is a significant factor in each of its major product markets.
 
ENGINEERED MATERIALS
 
     The Engineered Materials segment  manufactures chemicals, fibers,  plastics
and  advanced  materials with  applications  for numerous  industries, including
automotive, carpeting, refrigeration,  construction, electronics, computers  and
utilities.
 
     Following is a description of the major Engineered Materials businesses:

 
 






     Engineered  Materials' three  major businesses are  aligned around markets,
customers and  common technologies.  Brand identity,  service to  customers  and
quality   are  important  competitive  factors  in   the  market  and  there  is
considerable price competition.
 
     The Montreal Protocol (Protocol),  which was signed  by the United  States,
regulates  worldwide chlorofluorocarbons (CFC)  production and consumption. With
few exceptions, the Protocol required 100% elimination of fully halogenated  CFC
production by industrialized countries as of December 31, 1995. The amended U.S.
Clean  Air  Act  also  regulates  CFCs and  similarly  required  that  most U.S.
production of CFCs be phased out by  the end of 1995. The Company completed  its
efforts  to  develop  environmentally safer  fluorocarbon  products and replaced
its CFC product line. The Company has commercialized key CFC substitute products
in various applications, including automotive air conditioning and  residential,
commercial  and industrial refrigeration. The Company is continuing its research
and development efforts in view of the changing regulatory environment in  which
it operates. The Company cannot predict the impact of possible future regulatory
issues.
 
     Engineered  Materials operations are mainly located in the U.S., France and
Germany. Polymers  and Specialty  Chemicals  manufacturing facilities  are  also
located  in  the  Netherlands;  Electronic  Materials  maintains  facilities  in
Southeast  Asia,  including  Taiwan,   Singapore,  Thailand  and  South   Korea.
Engineered Materials also has significant exports worldwide.
 
     The   Engineered  Materials  segment  also  includes  the  following  other
businesses: carbon materials, environmental  catalysts and specialty films.  The
carbon  materials business produces binder pitch for electrodes for the aluminum
and carbon industries, creosote oils as preservatives for the wood products  and
carbon  black  markets,  refined  naphthalene as  a  chemical  intermediate, and
driveway sealer  tar  and  roofing  pitch for  the  construction  industry.  The
environmental catalysts business is a major worldwide supplier of catalysts used
in  catalytic  converters for  automobiles. In  November  1994, the  Company and
General Motors Corporation formed a  joint venture to produce coated  automotive
catalytic  converter substrates. Major products  in the specialty films business
include cast nylon (Capran'r'), biaxially oriented nylon film (Capran Emblem'r')
and  fluoropolymer  film  (Aclar'r').  Specialty  film  markets  include   food,
pharmaceutical, and other packaging and industrial applications.

     Note 26  (Geographic  Areas  --  Financial  Data)  of  Notes  to  Financial
Statements  in the Company's  1996 Annual Report  to shareowners is incorporated
herein by reference.
 
OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
     The Company  has  undertaken  certain repositioning  actions  that  require
employee  and asset relocation, plant  integration and capital improvements. The
repositioning actions are generally expected to be completed by 1998.
 
FOREIGN ACTIVITIES
 
     The Company's foreign businesses are  subject to the usual risks  attendant
upon investments in foreign countries, including nationalization, expropriation,
limitations  on repatriation of funds,  restrictive actions by local governments
and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
     The Company's principal foreign manufacturing operations are in  Australia,
Brazil,  Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, South
Korea, Spain, Singapore,  Taiwan, the  Netherlands and the  United Kingdom.  The
Company  maintains  sales  and  business  offices  in  these  and  various other
countries, including  Austria,  Belgium,  China, Denmark,  Finland,  Hong  Kong,
India,   New  Zealand,  Norway,  Sweden  and  Turkey  as  well  as  warehousing,
distribution and  aircraft repair  and overhaul  facilities to  support  foreign
operations  and export  sales. Further  information about  foreign activities is
discussed in the segment narratives.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
     The principal  raw  materials  used  by  the  Company's  segments  include:
Aerospace  -- carbon fiber;  electronic, optical and  mechanical component parts
and assemblies; electronic and electromechanical devices and metallic  products;
Automotive  --  castings,  forgings,  steel  and  bar  stock,  copper, aluminum,
platinum and titanium and Engineered  Materials -- cumene, natural gas,  sulfur,
terephthalic   acid,  ethylene  and  ethylene   glycol,  fluorspar,  HF,  carbon
tetrachloride, chloroform,  nylon  resins, fiberglass,  copper  foil,  platinum,
rhodium and coal tar pitch. The Company is producing virtually all of its HF and
nylon  resin requirements.  The principal  raw materials  used in  the Company's
operations are  generally readily  available. The  Company is  dependent on  its
suppliers  and subcontractors in order to meet commitments to its customers, and
many major components and product equipment items are procured or  subcontracted
with  a  number  of domestic  and  foreign  companies. The  Company  maintains a
qualification and performance  surveillance process to  control risk  associated
with such reliance on third parties. The Company believes that sources of supply
for raw materials and components are generally adequate.
 
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 
     The Company owns approximately 9,500 patents or pending patent applications
and  is  licensed  under other  patents  covering  certain of  its  products and
processes. It believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under such patents and
licenses are generally important to its  operations, but does not consider  that
any  patent or patent license  agreement or group of  them related to a specific
process or product is of material importance in relation to the Company's  total
business.
 
     The  Company also has  registered trademarks for a  number of its products.
Some of the  more significant  trademarks include:  AiResearch, Anso,  Autolite,
Bendix,  Bendix/King, Capron, Fram,  Garrett, Genetron, Jurid,  King and Norplex
Oak.
 
 
 



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
     The Company's research  activities are  directed toward  the discovery  and
development of new products and processes, improvements in existing products and
processes, and the development of new uses of existing products.

     Research  and development  expense totaled $345,  $353 and  $318 million in
1996, 1995  and 1994,  respectively.  Customer-sponsored (principally  the  U.S.
Government)  research and development activities amounted to an additional $536,
$536 and $486 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
     The Company is  subject to  various federal, state  and local  requirements
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to  the protection of the environment. It is the Company's policy to comply with
these requirements  and the  Company believes  that, as  a general  matter,  its
policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable
risk   of  environmental  damage,  and  of  resulting  financial  liability,  in
connection with its  business. Some  risk of environmental  damage is,  however,
inherent  in certain operations and products of the Company, as it is with other
companies engaged in similar businesses.  See the description of the  Engineered
Materials segment, above, for information regarding regulation of CFCs.
 
     The  Company is and has  been engaged in the  handling, manufacture, use or
disposal of many substances which are classified as hazardous or toxic by one or
more regulatory agencies. The  Company believes that, as  a general matter,  its
handling,  manufacture, use and  disposal of such substances  are in accord with
environmental laws  and  regulations.  It  is  possible,  however,  that  future
knowledge   or  other  developments,  such  as  improved  capability  to  detect
substances in  the  environment,  increasingly  strict  environmental  laws  and
standards  and enforcement  policies thereunder,  could bring  into question the
Company's handling, manufacture, use or disposal of such substances.
 
     Among other  environmental  requirements, the  Company  is subject  to  the
federal  superfund law, and similar state laws, under which the Company has been
designated as a potentially  responsible party which may  be liable for  cleanup
costs  associated with various hazardous  waste sites, some of  which are on the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's superfund priority list. Although,  under
some  court  interpretations  of  these  laws, there  is  a  possibility  that a
responsible party might  have to bear  more than its  proportional share of  the
cleanup  costs if  it is  unable to  obtain appropriate  contribution from other
responsible parties, the Company has not had to bear significantly more than its
proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.
 
     Capital expenditures  for  environmental  control  facilities  at  existing
operations  were $43 million in 1996. The  Company estimates that during each of
the years 1997  and 1998 such  capital expenditures will  be in the  $55 to  $60
million range. In addition to capital expenditures, the Company has incurred and
will continue to incur operating costs in connection with such facilities.
 
     Reference is made to Management's Discussion and Analysis at page 21 of the
Company's  1996 Annual Report to  shareowners, incorporated herein by reference,
for further information regarding environmental matters.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The Company had  an aggregate of  76,600 salaried and  hourly employees  at
December  31, 1996. Approximately 53,200 were located in the United States, and,
of these employees, about  25% were unionized  employees represented by  various
local or national unions.
 
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
 
     The  Company has 339 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories,
sales offices and other  facilities. The plants are  generally located to  serve
large  marketing areas and  to provide accessibility to  raw materials and labor
pools. The  properties are  generally maintained  in good  operating  condition.
Utilization of these plants may vary with government spending and other business
conditions;  however,  no major  operating facility  is significantly  idle. The
facilities, together with planned
 
 



expansions, are expected to meet the Company's needs for the foreseeable future.
The Company  owns or leases  warehouses,  railroad  cars,  barges,  automobiles,
trucks,  airplanes and materials handling and data processing equipment. It also
leases space for administrative and sales staffs. The Company's headquarters and
administrative complex are located at Morris Township, New Jersey.

     Market and  dividend  information  for the  Registrant's  common  stock  is
contained  in Note  27 (Unaudited Quarterly  Financial Information)  of Notes to
Financial Statements  at  page  38  of  the  Company's  1996  Annual  Report  to
shareowners, and such information is incorporated herein by reference.
 
     The  number of record holders of the Registrant's common stock is contained
in the statement  'Selected Financial  Data' at page  39 of  the Company's  1996
Annual  Report to  shareowners, and such  information is  incorporated herein by
reference.

     On July 10, 1996, the Company acquired Electron Vision Inc. in exchange for
148,941 shares of  common stock. Because  the fairness of  this transaction  had
been  approved by the California Department of Corporations, the transaction was
exempt from registration pursuant to Section  3(a)(10) of the Securities Act  of
1933, as amended (the 'Act').
 
     On October 3, 1996, in exchange for 143,355 shares of its common stock, the
Company acquired the assets of Lori, Inc. from The Nordam Group Inc. ('Nordam').
Because  Nordam is an 'accredited investor' within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(3)
under the Act, the common  shares of the Company  transferred to Nordam in  this
transaction were not registered under the Act, in reliance on Rule 506 under the
Act.
