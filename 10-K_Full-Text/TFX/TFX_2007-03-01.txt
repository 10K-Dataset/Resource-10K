    cargo-handling systems for commercial and military aviation as
    well as other industrial markets.

For more than 60 years, we have provided engineered
    products that help our customers meet their business
    requirements. We have grown through an active program of
    development of new products, introduction of products into new
    geographic or end-markets and through acquisitions of companies
    with related market, technology or industry expertise. We serve
    a diverse customer base through operations in 23 countries and
    local direct sales and distribution networks. In 2006, products
    directly distributed from our operations in the United States
    accounted for 43 percent of revenues, and products directly
    distributed from our operations in other countries represented
    57 percent of revenues.

Our Business
    Segments

We organize our business into three business
    segments — Commercial, Medical and Aerospace. For
    2006, the percentages of our consolidated net revenues
    represented by our segments were as follows:
    Commercial — 47%; Medical — 33%; and
    Aerospace — 20%. Additional information regarding our
    segments and geographic areas is presented in Note 15 to
    our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Commercial

Our Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
    manufacture and distribute driver control, motion control, power
    and vehicle management and fluid management products and
    systems. Our products are used by a wide range of markets
    including the passenger car and light truck, marine,
    recreational, mobile power equipment, military, agricultural and
    construction vehicle, truck and bus and various other industrial
    equipment sectors. Major manufacturing operations are located in
    North America, Europe and Asia.

    controls for seat-comfort, interior flexibility, movement and
    regulation of window, door, function and other safety controls
    and mobile power equipment controls and products for heavy-lift
    applications. While the largest portion of this category relates
    to seat and interior comfort and motion systems sold to
    automotive suppliers and industrial vehicle manufacturers, our
    motion systems also serve a wide range of other markets and
    applications. For example, we are a large supplier of safety
    cable and light-duty motion controls used in mobile power
    equipment, and our heavy-lift products,



which include heavy-duty cables,
    hoisting and rigging equipment, are used in oil drilling and
    other industrial markets.

Power and Vehicle Management Systems:

Products
    in this category represented 20 percent of Commercial
    Segment revenues in 2006. Power and vehicle management systems
    include: mobile auxiliary power systems, fuel management systems
    and components, industrial actuation products and components,
    instrumentation and electronic controls for engine and vehicle
    management, diagnostics and monitoring. These products generally
    address the need for greater fuel efficiency, reduced emissions,
    mobile power and improved connectivity of engine and vehicle
    systems. Our major products in this category include mobile
    auxiliary power units used for power and climate control in
    heavy duty trucks, industrial vehicles and locomotives,
    instrumentation and electronic products for marine and
    industrial vehicles and components and systems for the use of
    alternative fuels in military, industrial and automotive
    applications.

Fluid Management Systems:

Products in this
    category represented 11 percent of Commercial Segment
    revenues in 2006. Fluid management products include
    premium-branded, custom-manufactured and bulk hose and related
    assemblies that are generally custom-designed and manufactured
    to address specific requirements for vapor permeation,
    durability and flexibility. Our fluid management products can be
    found in automobiles, recreational boats, remote sensing
    devices, high-purity food processing, underground fuel transfer,
    compressed natural gas applications and in a number of other
    industrial product and equipment applications. The largest
    percentage of fluid management systems are sold to automotive
    and industrial customers.

Backlog:

As of December 31, 2006, our
    backlog of firm orders for our Commercial Segment was
    $247 million. This compares with $257 million as of
    December 25, 2005. Standard Commercial Segment products are
    typically shipped between two weeks and three months after
    receipt of order. Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not
    indicative of probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.

Marketing:

The majority of our Commercial
    Segment products are sold to original equipment manufacturers,
    or OEMs, through a direct sales force of field representatives
    and technical specialists. We also market our marine products
    and mobile auxiliary power units through dealers, distributors
    and retail outlets serving owners of recreational boats. Fuel
    systems and components include custom applications sold directly
    to industrial equipment manufacturers and to the automotive
    aftermarket principally in Europe.



Medical

Our Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
    distribute disposable medical products, surgical instruments,
    medical devices and specialty devices for healthcare providers
    and medical equipment manufacturers. Our products are largely
    sold and distributed to hospitals and healthcare providers in a
    range of clinical settings. Major manufacturing operations are
    located in North America, Europe and Asia.

Markets for these products are influenced by a number of factors
    including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns
    in the worldwide healthcare market.

Disposable Medical Products:

This is the
    largest product category in the Medical Segment, representing
    63 percent of segment revenues in 2006. Our disposable
    medical products are generally used in the clinical specialty
    areas of anesthesia, respiratory care and urology. Anesthesia
    and respiratory care products include those used in airway
    management, sleep therapy, oxygen administration and therapy,
    humidification and aerosol therapy. Urology products include:
    catheters and drain and irrigation supplies. Our products are
    marketed under the brand names of Rusch, HudsonRCI, Gibeck and
    Sheridan. The large majority of sales for disposable medical
    products are made to the hospital/healthcare provider market,
    with a smaller percentage sold to the home health market and
    medical device manufacturers.

Surgical Instruments and Medical
    Devices:

Products in this category represented
    27 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2006. Our
    surgical instrument and medical device products include:
    hand-held instruments for general and specialty surgical
    procedures, devices used in cardiovascular, orthopedic and
    general surgery and minimally-invasive diagnostic and
    therapeutic care. We also produce and market a range of ligation
    and closure products. In addition, we provide instrument
    management and sterilization services. We market surgical
    instruments and medical devices under the Deknatel, Pleur-evac,
    Pilling and Weck brand names.

Specialty Devices:

Specialty devices
    represented 10 percent of Medical Segment revenues in 2006.
    Products in this category include custom-designed and
    manufactured specialty instruments for cardiovascular and
    orthopedic procedures, specialty sutures, microcatheters,
    introducers and guidewires. We also design and manufacture
    specialty devices and instruments for industry leading medical
    device manufacturers and provide them with outsourcing services.
    Our brands include Beere, KMedic and Deknatel. Specialty devices
    are generally marketed to medical device manufacturers.

Backlog:

As of December 31, 2006, our
    backlog of firm orders for our Medical Segment was
    $65 million. This compares with $65 million as of
    December 25, 2005. We expect substantially all of the
    December 31, 2006 backlog to be filled in 2007. Most of our
    medical products are sold on orders calling for delivery within
    a few months. Therefore, the backlog of such orders is not
    indicative of probable revenues in any future

12-month

period.



Marketing:

Medical products are sold directly
    to hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original
    equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales
    forces and through independent representatives and independent
    distributor networks.

Aerospace

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide repair products and
    services for flight and ground-based turbine engines;
    manufacture and distribute precision-machined components; and
    design, manufacture and market cargo-handling systems. These
    products require a high degree of engineering sophistication and
    are often custom-designed. Major operations are located in North
    America, Europe and Asia.

Commercial aviation markets represent a significant majority
    percentage of revenues in this segment. Markets for these
    products are generally influenced by spending patterns in the
    commercial aviation and military markets.

Repair Products and Services:

The largest
    single product category in the Aerospace Segment, repair
    products and services represented 47 percent of segment
    revenues in 2006. This category includes repair technologies and
    services primarily for critical components of flight turbines,
    including fan blades and airfoils. We utilize advanced
    reprofiling and adaptive-machining techniques to improve
    efficiency of aircraft engine performance and reduce turnaround
    time for maintenance and repairs. Repair products and services
    are provided through service locations in North America, Europe
    and Asia. Our repair products and services business is conducted
    through a consolidated, but not wholly-owned, subsidiary called
    Airfoil Technologies International (ATI), whose product line
    serves many of the industry’s leading aircraft engine
    providers and a range of commercial airlines.

Cargo-handling Systems:

Products in this
    category represented 29 percent of Aerospace Segment
    revenues in 2006. Our cargo-handling systems include on-board
    cargo-handling systems for wide-body and narrow-body aircraft,
    actuators, cargo containers, aftermarket spare parts and repair
    services. Marketed under the Telair International brand name,
    our wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft OEMs
    or to airlines and air freight carriers as “buyer furnished
    equipment” for original installations or as retrofits for
    existing equipment. Our other Telair products in this category
    include narrow-body aircraft cargo-loading systems and cargo
    containers. We also manufacture and repair components for our
    systems and other related aircraft controls, including canopy
    and door actuators, cargo winches and flight controls.

Precision-Machined Components:

Products in
    this category represented 24 percent of Aerospace Segment
    revenues in 2006. Our precision-machined components include: fan
    blades, compressor blades, cases, blisks and other components
    for military and commercial flight turbine engines and a range
    of custom-designed and manufactured products for industrial
    markets. Most of our precision-machined components are sold to
    original equipment manufacturers of aircraft engines and for
    military applications, with a very small percentage of products
    sold to industrial markets.

Backlog:

As of December 31, 2006, our
    backlog of firm orders for our Aerospace Segment was
    $329 million, of which we expect approximately
    80 percent to be filled in 2007. Our backlog for our
    Aerospace Segment on December 25, 2005 was
    $316 million.

Marketing:

Generally, products sold to the
    aerospace market are sold through our own force of field
    representatives.

Discontinued
    Operations

In October 2006, we sold a small medical business that was
    classified as held for sale during the second quarter of 2005.
    During the third quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our
    automotive pedal systems business and sold a European medical
    product sterilization business. During the first quarter of
    2005, we completed the sale of Sermatech International, a
    surface-engineering/specialty coatings business. For 2006 and
    comparable periods, the small medical business, the automotive
    pedal systems business, the European medical product
    sterilization business and Sermatech business have been
    presented in our consolidated financial statements as
    discontinued operations. The Sermatech business was previously
    reported as part of our Aerospace Segment. For a more complete
    discussion, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Government
    Regulation

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
    products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
    products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
    government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
    manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
    products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
    European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and
    sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
    of our repair stations. The U.S. National Highway Traffic
    Safety Administration and government agencies in other countries
    regulate the manufacture and sale of many of our automotive
    products.

Competition

Given the range and diversity of our products and markets, no
    one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets
    and customers that we serve. In general, all of our segments and
    product lines face significant competition from competitors of
    varying sizes, although the number of competitors in each market
    tends to be limited. We believe that our competitive position
    depends on the technical competence and creative ability of our
    engineering personnel, the know-how and skill of our
    manufacturing personnel and the strength and scope of our sales,
    service and distribution networks.

Patents and
    Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
    We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
    individual products extend for varying periods according to the
    date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
    the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
    Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
    time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
    All capitalized product names throughout this document are
    trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
    Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
    to be of value in the future, we



do not consider any single patent or trademark, except for the
    Teleflex brand, to be essential to the operation of our business.

Suppliers and
    Materials

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
    from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
    locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
    substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
    for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
    we use are available from multiple sources, and where practical,
    we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
    commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
    have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
    our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
    cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
    OEMs.

Seasonality

A portion of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
    Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
    in the automotive and industrial markets are generally reduced
    in the third quarter of each year as a result of preparations by
    OEMs for the upcoming model year. In addition, marine
    aftermarket revenues generally increase in the second quarter as
    boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming season.
    Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as the
    frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues related
    to disposable medical products.

Employees

We employed approximately 19,800 full-time and temporary
    employees at December 31, 2006. Of these employees,
    approximately 7,100 were employed in the United States and
    12,700 in countries outside of the United States. Less than
    10 percent of our employees in the United States were
    covered by union contracts. We have government-mandated
    collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover
    employees in other countries. We believe we have good
    relationships with our employees.

Investor
    Information

We are subject to the informational requirements of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports and
    information, proxy statements and other information with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission. Such reports, proxy and

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

We are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. These
    risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and,
    accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the
    economy.

Although we believe that the diversified nature of our business
    reduces the risk that all of our operations would experience
    simultaneous cyclical downturns, many of the businesses which we
    operate are subject to specific industry and general economic
    cycles, most acutely in the automotive, marine, aerospace and
    transportation industries. Accordingly, any downturn in these or
    other markets in which we participate could materially adversely
    affect us. Moreover, if we fail to respond promptly to changes
    in demand, our results of operations could be materially
    adversely affected in any given quarter.

We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S. operations.

Although no material concentration of our manufacturing
    operations exists in any single country, we have significant
    manufacturing operations outside the United States, including
    entities that are not wholly-owned and other alliances. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately 45% of our total assets
    and 57% of our total revenues were attributable to products
    directly distributed from our operations outside the
    U.S. Our international operations are subject to varying
    degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S.,
    including:

•

exchange controls and currency restrictions;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements;

•

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are
    currently or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we
    have operations;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

differing labor regulations;

•

differing protection of intellectual property; and

•

unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks
    against American interests.

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
    our international operations or on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition generally.

Our products are typically integrated into other
    manufacturers’ products. As a result, changes in demand for
    our customers’ products may adversely affect our revenues
    on short notice.

Many of our customers in the Commercial and Aerospace segments,
    including OEMs, integrate our products into products our
    customers sell. Our customers also generally have no obligation
    to purchase any minimum quantity of product from us and may
    terminate our arrangement on short notice, typically 30 to
    90 days, sometimes less. Therefore, our reported backlog
    may not be realized as revenues. Revenues could



materially decline if these customers experience a reduction in
    demand for their products or cancel a significant number of
    contracts and we cannot replace them with similar arrangements.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
    reimbursement.

Demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the
    reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical
    expenses by government healthcare programs and private health
    insurers in the countries where we do business. Internationally,
    medical reimbursement systems vary significantly, with medical
    centers in some countries having fixed budgets, regardless of
    the level of patient treatment. Other countries require
    application for, and approval of, government or third party
    reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations
    by, and the financial support of, government and third party
    insurers, the market for some of our medical products could be
    adversely impacted.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
    current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
    existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
    reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our
    business. In addition, as a result of their purchasing power,
    these payors often seek discounts, price reductions or other
    incentives from medical products suppliers. Our provision of
    such pricing concessions could negatively impact our revenues
    and product margins.

Uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation
    and regulations, as well as private market practices, could
    affect our ability to sell our products in acceptable quantities
    at profitable prices.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest
    rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
    prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
    manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S. markets

to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
    revenue. Our consolidated financial statements reflect
    translation of items denominated in

non-U.S. currencies

to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
    U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
    foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
    our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
    revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we maintain a
    currency hedging program to reduce the effects of this
    fluctuation, changes in the relative values of currencies occur
    from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant
    effect on our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin
    content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
    copper and zinc. Although we monitor our exposure to these
    commodity price increases as an integral part of our overall
    risk management program, volatility in the prices of these
    commodities could increase the costs of our products and
    services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our
    customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and cash flows.

Our failure to successfully develop new products could
    adversely affect our results.

The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
    ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
    to enhance existing products, including developing electronic
    technology to replace or improve upon mechanical technology.
    This product development may require substantial investment by
    us. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not
    occur with respect to the development, performance or market
    acceptance of new technologies or products, such as the
    inability to:

•

identify viable new products;

•

obtain adequate intellectual property protection;



•

gain market acceptance of new products; or

•

successfully obtain regulatory approvals.

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
    and market new products. Our failure to successfully develop and
    market new products could reduce our margins, which would have
    an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Our technology is important to our success, and our failure
    to protect this technology could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
    believe that the development and protection of these
    intellectual property rights is important to the future success
    of our business. In addition to relying on our patents,
    trademarks and copyrights, we rely on confidentiality agreements
    with employees and other measures, to protect our know-how and
    trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary
    rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or
    otherwise obtain and use these products or technology. The steps
    we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this
    technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
    not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the
    U.S. Moreover, there can be no assurance that others will
    not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or
    develop better technology than us or that current and former
    employees, contractors and other parties will not breach
    confidentiality agreements, misappropriate proprietary
    information and copy or otherwise obtain and use our information
    and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise
    infringe on our intellectual property rights. Our inability to
    protect our proprietary technology could result in competitive
    harm that could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of
    our business that could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations and financial condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
    actions involving product liability, contracts, intellectual
    property, employment and environmental matters. The defense of
    these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and
    we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits.
    In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or
    settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable
    remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

While we do not believe that any litigation in which we are
    currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome
    of these legal proceedings may differ from our expectations
    because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory
    matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product
    liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought
    against us.

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in
    the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to
    perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is
    alleged to result, in bodily injury

and/or

property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material
    warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur
    significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of
    our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be
    required to participate in a recall of that product if the
    defect or the alleged defect relates to safety. Product
    liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Much of our business is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and failure to comply with those regulations could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
    financial condition.

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
    countries regulate our products and the products sold by our
    customers incorporating our products. The U.S. National
    Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates the manufacture
    and sale of many of our automotive products. The U.S. Food
    and Drug



Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and sale
    and marketing of many of our medical products. The
    U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
    Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacture and sale of some
    of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our
    repair stations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations
    and quality assurance guidelines could lead to manufacturing
    shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing.

We are also subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and
    local environmental protection and health and safety laws
    governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
    frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
    We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
    current or future environmental protection and health and safety
    laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
    of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
    estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and
    results of operations. Moreover, we may be subject to additional
    environmental claims, which may include claims for personal
    injury or cleanup, in the future based on our past, present or
    future business activities, which could also adversely affect
    our financial condition and results of operations.

The costs associated with our restructuring programs may be
    greater than expected.

We are engaged in restructuring programs, which require
    management to utilize significant estimates related to
    realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and
    expenses for severance and other employee separation costs,
    lease cancellation and other exit costs. Actual results could
    differ materially from those estimated due to, among other
    things: unanticipated expenditures in connection with the
    effectuation of the programs; costs and length of time required
    to comply with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects
    of the programs; inability to realize anticipated cost savings;
    and unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation
    of manufacturing and administrative functions.

Our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning
    system in our Medical Segment may result in problems that could
    adversely affect us.

We are in the process of implementing a third party enterprise
    resource planning, or ERP, system across our Medical Segment in
    an effort to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more
    effective management of business operations. The first phase of
    the implementation, which relates to our Medical Segment
    operations in North America, is expected to be completed in the
    third quarter of 2007. In the event we encounter any problems in
    the implementation of the ERP system, we could experience
    business disruptions in our Medical Segment, which could
    adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention
    of our Medical Segment management team away from daily
    operations. In addition, any delays in the implementation of the
    ERP system could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs.
    Should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows
    and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our acquisitions and strategic alliances may not meet revenue
    or profit expectations.

As part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may
    continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into
    strategic alliances. However, we may not be able to identify
    suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or
    integrate acquisitions successfully. In this regard,
    acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in
    the integration of the operations, technologies, services and
    products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns.
    Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
    inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no
    assurance that we will properly ascertain all such risks. In
    addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
    acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
    additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions



may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
    securities. There can be no assurance that difficulties
    encountered with acquisitions will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
    agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
    services.

Approximately 17% of our manufacturing revenues are produced by
    operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
    covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
    agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a
    significant portion of our workforce will remain covered by
    collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable
    future. Strikes or work stoppages could occur that would
    adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our
    ability to conduct our business.

In addition to the properties listed above, we own or lease
    approximately 1,399,000 square feet of warehousing,
    manufacturing and office space located in the United States,
    Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia. We
    also own or lease certain properties that are no longer being
    used in our operations. We are actively marketing these owned
    properties and seeking to sublease these leased properties. At
    December 31, 2006, the owned properties were classified as
    held for sale.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
    normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
    actions involving product liability, intellectual property,
    employment and environmental matters. Based on information
    currently available, advice of counsel, established reserves and
    other resources, we do not believe that any such actions are
    likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our
    business, financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further



developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of
    these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be
    materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results
    of operations or liquidity.

In February 2004, a jury verdict of $34.8 million was
    rendered against one of our subsidiaries in a trademark
    infringement action. In February 2005, the trial judge entered
    an order rejecting the jury award in its entirety. In October
    2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    upheld the February 2005 decision. As no appeal of the Court of
    Appeals’ decision was filed within the requisite time for
    filing appeals in this matter, the decision has become final.

Various senior and term note agreements provide for the
    maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase
    of our stock and payment of cash dividends. Under the most
    restrictive of these provisions, $148 million of retained
    earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at
    December 31, 2006. On February 21, 2007, the Board of
    Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share
    on our common stock, which is payable on March 15, 2007 to
    holders of record on March 5, 2007. As of February 15,
    2007, we had approximately 957 holders of record of our common
    stock.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of outstanding Teleflex
    common stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006,
    our Board of Directors extended for an additional six months,
    until January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of
    shares. Under the approved plan, we repurchased a total of
    2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005 and the
    first nine months of 2006 for an aggregate purchase price of
    $140.0 million, and aggregate fees and commissions of
    $0.1 million.



The following graph provides a comparison of five year
    cumulative total stockholder returns of Teleflex common stock,
    the Standard & Poor (S&P) 500 Stock Index and the
    S&P MidCap 400 Index. We have selected the S&P MidCap
    400 Index because, due to the diverse nature of our businesses,
    we do not believe that there exists a relevant published
    industry or

line-of-business

index and do not believe we can reasonably identify a peer
    group. The annual changes for the five-year period shown on the
    graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in
    Teleflex common stock and each index on December 31, 2001
    and that all dividends were reinvested.

    financial results as discontinued operations.

(2)

Free cash flow is calculated by reducing operating cash flow by
    capital expenditures and dividends. Free cash flow may be
    considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We use this financial
    measure for internal managerial purposes, when publicly
    providing guidance on possible future results, and as a means to
    evaluate

period-to-period

comparisons. This financial measure is used in addition to and
    in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP
    and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial
    measures. This financial measure reflects an additional way of
    viewing an aspect of our operations



that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying
    reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure,
    provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends
    affecting our business. Management believes that free cash flow
    is a useful measure to investors because it provides an
    indication of the amount of our cash flow currently available to
    support our ongoing operations. Management strongly encourages
    investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed
    reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single
    financial measure. The following is a reconciliation of free
    cash flow to the nearest GAAP measure as required under
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Overview

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
    through the continued development of our core businesses and
    carefully selected acquisitions. Our internal growth initiatives
    include the development of new products, moving existing
    products into market adjacencies in which we already participate
    with other products and the expansion of market share. Our core
    revenue growth in 2006 as compared to 2005, excluding the
    impacts of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, was 5%. Core
    growth was strongest in our Aerospace Segment, which grew 8%,
    and weakest in our Medical Segment, which grew 3% year over year.

Segment operating profit increased 10% in 2006 due primarily to
    cost and productivity improvements in our Aerospace and Medical
    segments, offset, in part, by a decline in our Commercial
    Segment margins.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of our outstanding common
    stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006, our
    Board of Directors extended for an additional six months, until
    January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of shares.
    Under the approved plan, we repurchased a total of
    2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006
    for an aggregate purchase price of $140.0 million, and
    aggregate fees and commissions of $0.1 million, with
    1,627,247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate
    purchase price of $93.5 million, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $0.1 million.

In November 2006, we acquired Taut, Inc., or Taut, a producer of
    instruments and devices for minimally invasive surgical
    procedures, particularly laparoscopic surgery, for
    $28.0 million. The results for Taut are included in our
    Medical Segment. Also in November 2006, we acquired Ecotrans
    Technologies, Inc., or Ecotrans, a leading supplier of
    locomotive anti-idling and emissions reduction solutions for the
    railroad industry, for $10.1 million. The results for
    Ecotrans are included in our Commercial Segment.

Critical
    Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
    of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.



We have identified the following as critical accounting
    estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
    significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
    and important to the presentation of our financial condition and
    results of operations and could potentially result in materially
    different results under different assumptions and conditions.

Inventory
    Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inherent
    in this valuation are significant management judgments and
    estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates.
    Based upon these judgments and estimates, we record a reserve to
    adjust the carrying amount of our inventories. We regularly
    compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or
    forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate
    obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical
    usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate
    the reasonableness of using historical information as an
    estimate of future usage. Our inventory reserve was
    $46.6 million and $44.6 million at December 31,
    2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively.

Accounting for
    Long-Lived Assets and Investments

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
    periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
    inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
    based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow
    projections. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Accounting for
    Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we perform an annual
    impairment test of our recorded goodwill. In addition, we test
    our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
    These impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates
    of future performance, long-term discount rates and market price
    valuation multiples. These estimates will likely change over
    time. Many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and
    the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate
    as a result of this cyclicality. Goodwill and other intangible
    assets totaled $725.8 million and $712.0 million at
    December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively.

Accounting for
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
    employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare.
    Several statistical and other factors which are designed to
    project future events are used in calculating the expense and
    liability related to these plans. These factors include
    actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
    return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
    and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
    assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
    assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

Significant differences in our actual experience or significant
    changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and
    other postretirement obligations and our future expense. A
    50 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would
    have decreased the total net periodic pension and postretirement
    healthcare expense for 2006 by approximately $1.8 million
    and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation at
    December 31, 2006 by approximately $17.9 million. A
    50 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would
    have increased these amounts by approximately $2.0 million
    and $19.7 million, respectively. A 50 basis point
    change in the expected return on plan assets would have impacted
    2006 annual pension expense by approximately $0.7 million.
    A 1.0% increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have
    increased the 2006 benefit expense by approximately
    $0.3 million and would have increased the projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $2.7 million. A 1.0% decrease
    in the assumed healthcare trend rate would have decreased the



2006 benefit expense by approximately $0.1 million and
    would have decreased the projected benefit obligation by
    approximately $2.3 million.

Accounting for
    Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs, which include termination benefits,
    contract termination costs and other restructuring costs, are
    recorded at estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating
    the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated
    to exit certain contractual obligations and the timing of
    employees leaving the company.

Accounting for
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the
    collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is
    doubtful. The allowance is based on our historical experience,
    the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
    the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
    We review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary.
    Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $10.1 million at
    both December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005.

Product Warranty
    Liability

Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the
    repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a
    specified period after the time of the sales. We estimate our
    warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors
    including historical trends of units sold, the status of
    existing claims, recall programs and communication with
    customers. Our estimated product warranty liability was
    $14.1 million and $14.2 million at December 31,
    2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively.

Accounting for
    Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
    uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
    estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
    world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
    international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
    audits, disputes and potentially litigation, the outcome of
    which is uncertain. Management must make judgments about such
    uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
    liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future
    adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary.
    Our income taxes payable was $38.6 million and
    $46.2 million at December 31, 2006 and
    December 25, 2005, respectively.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future
    taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could
    be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
    assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount
    of, valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the
    extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments
    to the valuation allowances may be required.

Accounting
    Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 requires that the
    impact of a tax position be recognized in the financial
    statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position
    will be sustained on tax audit, based on the technical merits of
    the position. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of tax positions that do not meet the “more
    likely than not” standard, classification of tax assets and
    liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of



FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of FIN No. 48 on our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Results of
    Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
    purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of
    acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
    considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
    translating the results of international subsidiaries at
    different currency exchange rates from year to year, the impact
    of eliminating the one-month reporting lag for certain of our
    foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested
    companies within the most recent twelve-month period. The
    following comparisons exclude the impact of the automotive pedal
    systems business, Sermatech International business, European
    medical product sterilization business and small medical
    business, which have been presented in our consolidated
    financial results as discontinued operations.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Revenues increased 5% in 2006 to $2.65 billion from
    $2.51 billion in 2005, principally due to core growth. The
    Commercial, Medical and Aerospace segments comprised 47%, 33%
    and 20% of our 2006 revenues, respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
    revenues improved to 70.7% in 2006 from 71.8% in 2005, due
    primarily to the benefits of our restructuring initiatives and
    other cost reduction efforts. Selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses (operating expenses) as a percentage of
    revenues increased to 18.6% in 2006 compared with 17.9% in 2005,
    due primarily to $10.4 million of costs associated with the
    initial phases of an information systems implementation program
    in our Medical Segment, $6.8 million of stock-based
    compensation expensed under SFAS No. 123(R) and
    various temporary inefficiencies in our Medical Segment during
    the first half of 2006.

Interest expense declined in 2006 principally as a result of
    lower debt balances. Interest income increased in 2006 primarily
    due to higher average cash balances and more favorable interest
    rates compared to the prior period. The effective income tax
    rate was 24.72% in 2006 compared with 22.99% 2005. The increase
    in the effective income tax rate primarily reflects the
    favorable impact in 2005 of the American Jobs Creation Act, or
    AJCA, repatriation benefit. Minority interest in consolidated
    subsidiaries increased $4.6 million in 2006 due to
    increased profits from our entities that are not wholly-owned.
    Net income for 2006 was $139.4 million compared to
    $138.8 million for 2005. Diluted earnings per share
    increased 3% to $3.49 for 2006.

On December 26, 2005, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
    which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
    expense for all stock-based awards made to employees based on
    estimated fair values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes
    previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board, or APB,
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. In March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107, providing supplemental implementation guidance for
    SFAS 123(R). We have applied the provisions of
    SAB No. 107 in our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the
    fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an
    option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
    is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service periods. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    using the modified prospective application method, which
    requires the application of the standard starting from
    December 26, 2005, the first day of our 2006 fiscal year.
    Our consolidated financial statements for 2006 reflect the
    impact of SFAS No. 123(R).



Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock
    options recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for 2006 was
    $6.8 million and is included in selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses. The total income tax benefit recognized
    for share-based compensation arrangements for 2006 was
    $1.4 million. As of December 31, 2006, total
    unamortized stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested
    stock options, net of expected forfeitures, was
    $9.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted
    for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with APB No. 25, as allowed under
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Under the intrinsic value method, no
    stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options had
    been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations
    because the exercise price of our stock options granted to
    employees equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock
    at the date of grant. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method we used in adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R), our results of operations prior to
    fiscal 2006 have not been restated to reflect, and do not
    include, the impact of SFAS No. 123(R).

Additional information regarding stock-based compensation and
    our stock compensation plans is presented in Notes 1 and 11
    to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

In June 2006, we began certain restructuring initiatives that
    affect all three of our operating segments. These initiatives
    involve the consolidation of operations and a related reduction
    in workforce at several of our facilities in Europe and North
    America. We have determined to undertake these initiatives as a
    means to improving operating performance and to better leverage
    our existing resources. The charges associated with the 2006
    restructuring program that are included in restructuring and
    impairment charges during 2006 totaled $5.9 million, of
    which 55%, 26% and 19% were attributable to our Commercial,
    Medical and Aerospace segments, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2006, we expect to incur future restructuring
    costs associated with our 2006 restructuring program of between
    $3.0 million and $5.4 million in our Commercial,
    Medical and Aerospace segments over the next two quarters.

During the first quarter of 2006, we began a restructuring
    activity in our Aerospace Segment. The actions relate to the
    closure of a manufacturing facility, termination of employees
    and relocation of operations. The charges associated with this
    activity that are included in restructuring and impairment
    charges during 2006 totaled $0.6 million. We do not expect
    to incur future restructuring costs associated with this
    activity.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced and commenced
    implementation of a restructuring and divestiture program
    designed to improve future operating performance and position us
    for future earnings growth. The actions have included exiting or
    divesting non-core or low performing businesses, consolidating
    manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative
    functions to enable businesses to share services. The charges,
    including changes in estimates, associated with the 2004
    restructuring and divestiture program for continuing operations
    that are included in restructuring and impairment charges during
    2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $10.4 million,
    $27.1 million and $67.6 million, respectively. The
    $10.4 million was attributable to our Medical Segment. Of
    the $27.1 million, 13%, 76% and 11% were attributable to
    our Commercial, Medical and Aerospace segments, respectively. Of
    the $67.6 million, 31%, 15% and 54% were attributable to
    our Commercial, Medical and Aerospace segments, respectively. As
    of December 31, 2006, we expect to incur future
    restructuring costs associated with our 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program of between $1.6 million and
    $3.2 million in our Medical Segment during 2007.

Certain costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program are not included in restructuring and
    impairment charges. All inventory adjustments that resulted from
    the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other
    costs associated with closing out businesses during 2005 and
    2004 are included in materials, labor and other product costs
    and totaled $2.0 million and $17.0 million,
    respectively. The $2.0 million in costs for 2005 related to
    our Aerospace Segment. Of the $17.0 million in costs for
    2004, $4.5 million and $12.5 million were attributed
    to our Commercial and Aerospace segments, respectively.



The cost savings from our restructuring programs were lower than
    expected in 2006 due primarily to implementation inefficiencies
    in our Medical Segment during the first half of the year, but we
    began to experience our anticipated rate of savings during the
    second half of the year.

For a more complete discussion of our restructuring programs,
    see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We performed an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of
    2006 and determined that a portion of our goodwill was impaired.
    We recorded a charge of $1.0 million, which is included in
    restructuring and impairment charges. Also during 2006, we
    determined that three minority held investments and certain
    fixed assets were impaired and recorded an aggregate charge of
    $7.4 million, which is included in restructuring and
    impairment charges.

Comparison of
    2005 and 2004

Revenues increased 5% in 2005 to $2.51 billion from
    $2.39 billion in 2004. This increase was due to increases
    of 5% from core growth and 4% from acquisitions, offset, in
    part, by decreases of 3% from dispositions and 1% from the
    impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag in 2004 for
    certain of our foreign operations. The Commercial, Medical and
    Aerospace segments comprised 47%, 33% and 20% of our 2005
    revenues, respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
    revenues increased to 71.8% in 2005 compared with 71.3% in 2004
    due primarily to the impact of duplicate costs and
    inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between
    facilities in the Commercial Segment associated with the
    restructuring program. Selling, engineering and administrative
    expenses (operating expenses) as a percentage of revenues
    declined to 17.9% in 2005 compared with 20.4% in 2004 due
    primarily to the continuing reduction of facilities and
    supporting infrastructure costs and decreased corporate expenses
    relative to higher revenues.

Interest expense increased in 2005 principally from higher
    acquisition related debt balances in the first half of 2005.
    Interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to higher
    average cash balances, related to increased proceeds received
    from sales of businesses and assets in 2005. The effective
    income tax rate was 22.99% in 2005 compared with 13.17% in 2004.
    The higher rate in 2005 was primarily the result of the increase
    in foreign earnings for businesses located in higher-taxed
    jurisdictions. Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries
    increased $1.1 million in 2005 due to increased profits
    from our entities that are not wholly-owned. Net income for 2005
    was $138.8 million, an increase of $129.3 million from
    2004, due primarily to a 60% decrease in restructuring costs and
    to the gain on the sale of the Sermatech business. Diluted
    earnings per share increased $3.15 to $3.39, and includes the
    net gain on sales of businesses and assets and the cost of
    restructuring and discontinued operations.

Segment
    Reviews

The following is a discussion of our segment operating results.
    Additional information regarding our segments is presented in
    Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included
    in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Commercial

Products in the Commercial Segment are manufactured for broad
    distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual
    customer needs. Consumer spending patterns influence the market
    trends for products sold to the automotive, marine and certain
    power equipment markets.

Automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily
    for automotive OEMs. Discussion of marine and industrial product
    lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of
    driver controls,



motion controls, power and vehicle management systems and fuel
    management systems to the automotive supply, marine and
    industrial markets.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Commercial Segment revenues increased 5% in 2006 to
    $1.25 billion from $1.19 billion in 2005, principally
    due to core growth. The segment benefited from increased sales
    in 2006 of alternative fuel systems and auxiliary power systems
    and sales of heavy-duty rigging and cable used in marine
    construction and the securing of oil platforms, offset, in part,
    by lower volume and customer price reductions for automotive
    products.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 3% in 2006 to
    $78.4 million from $81.1 million in 2005. Operating
    profit improvements resulting from sales of auxiliary power
    units and other higher margin industrial products were more than
    offset by costs associated with the end of certain automotive
    programs, mix and margin pressure associated with lower volume
    and customer price reductions for automotive products coupled
    with increases in commodity pricing. Operating profit as a
    percent of revenues declined to 6.3% in 2006 from 6.8% in 2005.

Assets in the Commercial Segment declined $11.1 million or
    2%, primarily due to the decrease in net property, plant and
    equipment and accounts receivable, offset, in part, by the
    impact of currency.

Comparison of
    2005 and 2004

Commercial Segment revenues declined 1% in 2005 to
    $1.19 billion from $1.20 billion in 2004. The segment
    generated an increase of 3% from core growth that was more than
    offset by a 4% decrease from dispositions. The segment benefited
    from strength in its industrial OEM markets, the contribution of
    new driver controls and power and vehicle management system
    products and increased sales of driver and motion controls to
    automotive OEM markets. These benefits were more than offset by
    slower sales of products into marine and recreational markets.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 23% in 2005 to
    $81.1 million from $105.7 million in 2004. This
    decline primarily reflects lower volume related contributions
    from higher margin marine and recreational products, the impact
    of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of
    products between two Tier 2 automotive supply facilities,
    the bankruptcy of an automotive supply customer and the impact
    of divestitures made in 2004. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues declined to 6.8% in 2005 from 8.8% in 2004.

Assets in the Commercial Segment declined $120.2 million or
    14%, primarily due to the decrease in non-current deferred tax
    assets and net property, plant and equipment and the impact of
    currency.

Medical

Products in the Medical Segment generally are required to meet
    exacting standards of performance and have long product life
    cycles. Economic influences on revenues relate primarily to
    spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital
    supply market.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Medical Segment revenues increased 3% in 2006 to
    $858.7 million from $831.1 million in 2005,
    principally due to core growth. The segment benefited from sales
    of new products in respiratory care and sleep therapy, including
    distribution of products through alliances with other
    manufacturers, and continued growth of diagnostic and
    therapeutic device products sold to medical device
    manufacturers, offset by a decline in sales of orthopedic
    specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 8% in 2006 to
    $161.7 million from $150.0 million in 2005. This
    increase primarily reflects cost and productivity improvements
    in the second half of the year, following



completion of significant restructuring activities. During the
    first half of 2006, operating profit was negatively impacted by
    costs associated with operational inefficiencies and the
    consolidation of facilities and distribution centers. We also
    incurred significant costs as planned in connection with the
    initial phases of an information systems implementation program
    during the first half of 2006. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues increased to 18.8% in 2006 from 18.0% in 2005.

Assets in the Medical Segment declined $6.6 million or 1%,
    primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable, deferred
    tax assets and net property, plant and equipment, offset, in
    part, by the impact of the Taut acquisition and the impact of
    currency.

Comparison of
    2005 and 2004

Medical Segment revenues increased 13% in 2005 to
    $831.1 million from $736.4 million in 2004. This
    increase was due to increases of 13% from acquisitions and 3%
    from core growth, offset, in part, by decreases of 2% from the
    impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag in 2004 for
    certain of our foreign operations and 1% from dispositions.
    Medical Segment revenues increased primarily as a result of the
    increased sale of disposable medical products, particularly
    related to the third quarter 2004 acquisition of HudsonRCI, a
    provider of respiratory care products. Sales of surgical
    instruments and medical devices increased primarily as a result
    of new product sales and volume increases for specialty devices
    sold to medical device manufacturers.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 29% in 2005 to
    $150.0 million from $116.7 million in 2004 driven
    primarily by the HudsonRCI acquisition and significant
    improvements in the core business as benefits of the
    restructuring program began to be recognized. Operating profit
    as a percent of revenues increased to 18.0% in 2005 from 15.8%
    in 2004.

Assets in the Medical Segment declined $166.0 million or
    15%, primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable,
    including the sale of certain receivables under a non-recourse
    securitization program, the decrease in non-current deferred tax
    assets and the impact of currency.

Aerospace

Products and services in the Aerospace Segment, many of which
    are proprietary, require a high degree of engineering
    sophistication and are often custom-designed. Economic
    influences on these products and services relate primarily to
    spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and the
    demand for additional air cargo capacity.

Comparison of
    2006 and 2005

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 9% in 2006 to
    $537.2 million from $493.8 million in 2005. This
    increase was due to increases of 8% from core growth and 1% from
    acquisitions. Core growth in wide body cargo handling systems,
    repair services and precision machined components was partially
    offset by the $6.5 million decrease in revenues resulting
    from the phase out of our industrial gas turbine aftermarket
    services business in 2005.

Aerospace Segment operating profit increased 51% to
    $50.6 million from $33.4 million in 2005.
    Volume-related efficiencies, additional higher margin cargo
    spares sales and mix within our precision-machined components
    business contributed to the improvement as did a reduction in
    losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine
    aftermarket services business. Operating profit as a percent of
    revenues increased to 9.4% in 2006 from 6.8% in 2005.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment increased $4.3 million or
    2%, primarily due to the impact of currency.



Comparison of
    2005 and 2004

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 9% in 2005 to
    $493.8 million from $453.2 million in 2004. Strong
    core growth in repair products and services and in sales of both
    narrow-body cargo loading systems and wide-body cargo system
    conversions, along with an increase due to a small acquisition
    in 2005, was partially offset by the impact of eliminating the
    one-month reporting lag in 2004 for certain of our foreign
    operations and by the phase out and closure of industrial gas
    turbine aftermarket services.

Aerospace Segment operating profit increased to a profit of
    $33.4 million in 2005 from a loss of $10.5 million in
    2004, an improvement of $43.9 million. Higher volume and
    improvements in precision-machined components and the cargo
    systems businesses contributed to the increase as did a
    reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial
    gas turbine aftermarket services. Operating profit (loss) as a
    percent of revenues was 6.8% in 2005 versus (2.3)% in 2004.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment declined $107.7 million or
    30%, primarily due to the impact of the sale of the Sermatech
    International business.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of $343.9 million during 2006. Changes in our
    operating assets and liabilities during 2006 resulted in a net
    cash inflow of $46.8 million. The most significant change
    was a decrease in accounts receivable, which was primarily due
    to improved cash collection. Our financing activities from
    continuing operations during 2006 consisted primarily of
    purchases of shares of our common stock of $93.6 million, a
    decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of
    $68.8 million, a reduction in long-term borrowings of
    $55.0 million and payment of dividends of
    $44.1 million. Our investing activities from continuing
    operations during 2006 consisted primarily of capital
    expenditures of $63.2 million and payments for businesses
    acquired of $41.7 million, including a $4.3 million
    deferred payment related to a prior period acquisition. During
    2006, we also had proceeds from the sale of businesses and
    assets of $8.0 million and made a $6.0 million payment
    in connection with a post-closing purchase price adjustment
    based on working capital for a divested business. We had net
    cash provided by discontinued operations of $0.7 million in
    2006.

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of approximately $333.5 million during 2005. Changes
    in our operating assets and liabilities during 2005 resulted in
    a net cash inflow of $69.7 million. The most significant
    change was a decrease in accounts receivable, which was
    primarily due to improved cash collection including the sale of
    certain receivables under a non-recourse securitization program.
    Our financing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of a
    reduction in long-term borrowings of $270.3 million and
    proceeds from long-term borrowings of $109.2 million, as a
    result of improved operating cash flow, the repatriation of
    foreign earnings, proceeds from the disposition of businesses
    and lower capital spending. During 2005, we also paid dividends
    to minority interest shareholders of $63.0 million and made
    purchases of shares of our common stock of $46.5 million.
    Our investing activities during 2005 consisted primarily of
    proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of
    $142.9 million. During 2005, we also had capital
    expenditures of $69.9 million. We had net cash used in
    discontinued operations of $2.7 million in 2005.

Operating activities from continuing operations provided net
    cash of approximately $249.9 million during 2004. Changes
    in our operating assets and liabilities during 2004 resulted in
    a net cash inflow of $25.9 million. The most significant
    changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued
    expenses and a decrease in inventories, offset, in part, by an
    increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes
    payable. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses
    was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the
    restructuring and divestiture program. The decrease in
    inventories was the result of our focus on improved working
    capital management. The increase in accounts receivable was
    largely a result of increased business levels and the HudsonRCI
    acquisition. The decrease in income taxes payable was a result
    of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and
    divestiture program, for which the cash benefits were received
    in 2005.



Our financing activities during 2004 consisted primarily of the
    receipt of $511.6 million in gross proceeds from long-term
    borrowings, primarily for the acquisition of HudsonRCI. This
    amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current
    borrowings of $137.8 million and a reduction in long-term
    borrowings of $77.9 million, driven by improved operating
    cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower

year-over-year

capital spending. Our investing activities during 2004 consisted
    primarily of payments for businesses acquired of
    $458.5 million. We had net cash provided by discontinued
    operations of $7.4 million in 2004.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
    non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity,
    which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a
    commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
    that interest to third party investors. The assets of the
    special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our
    obligations. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,” transfers of assets under the program qualify
    as sales of receivables and accordingly, $40.1 million of
    accounts receivable and the related amounts previously recorded
    in notes payable were removed from the consolidated balance
    sheet as of both December 31, 2006 and December 25,
    2005.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of up to $140 million of our outstanding common
    stock over twelve months ended July 2006. In June 2006, our
    Board of Directors extended for an additional six months, until
    January 2007, its authorization for the repurchase of shares.
    Under the approved plan, we repurchased a total of
    2,317,347 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006
    for an aggregate purchase price of $140.0 million, and
    aggregate fees and commissions of $0.1 million, with
    1,627,247 shares repurchased during 2006 for an aggregate
    purchase price of $93.5 million, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $0.1 million.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
    $51.3 million and $32.6 million at December 31,
    2006 and December 25, 2005, respectively, relates
    principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
    deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
    in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
    sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
    related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
    which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
    maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
    or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
    valuation allowance increase in 2006 was primarily attributable
    to the recording of deferred tax assets associated with state
    tax loss carryforwards at full value which required a valuation
    allowance.

In addition to the cash generated from operations, we have
    approximately $406 million in committed and
    $165 million in uncommitted unused lines of credit
    available. The availability of the lines of credit is dependent
    upon us maintaining our financial condition including our
    continued compliance with bank covenants. Various senior and
    term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain
    financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and
    payment of cash dividends. Under the most restrictive of these
    provisions, $148 million of retained earnings was available
    for dividends and stock repurchases at December 31, 2006.

On February 21, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a
    quarterly dividend of $0.285 per share on our common stock,
    which is payable on March 15, 2007 to holders of record on
    March 5, 2007. As of February 15, 2007, we had
    approximately 957 holders of record of our common stock.

Fixed rate borrowings, excluding the effect of derivative
    instruments, comprised 82% of total borrowings at
    December 31, 2006. Approximately 19% of our total
    borrowings of $518.4 million are denominated in currencies
    other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, which we
    believe provides a natural hedge against fluctuations in the
    value of assets outside the United States.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, in order to take advantage of
    the provisions of the AJCA, management executed a foreign
    earnings repatriation plan. Under this plan, we repatriated
    $304 million of dividends during November and December 2005.

The decline in our percent of net debt to total capital for 2006
    as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the repayment of current
    and long-term borrowings during 2006, which was funded
    principally by cash generated from operations.

We believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to
    access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us
    to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and
    additional acquisition opportunities.

Purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods

    specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum
    quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable pricing
    provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions. These
    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

We also have obligations with respect to our pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans. See Note 13 to our
    consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
    plant and equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
    payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
    approximately $4.8 million.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
    access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
    currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
    non-recourse basis to a



consolidated special purpose entity, which in turn sells an
    interest in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The
    conduit issues notes secured by that interest to third party
    investors. The assets of the special purpose entity are not
    available to satisfy our obligations. In accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 140, transfers of assets under
    the program qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly,
    $40.1 million of accounts receivable and the related
    amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from
    the consolidated balance sheet as of both December 31, 2006
    and December 25, 2005.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
    fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
    derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
    of some of these risks. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in
    the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the
    valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
    borrowing activities and our cash balances. Interest rate swaps
    are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
    table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
    interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
    rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown below are
    weighted average rates of the debt portfolio. For the swaps,
    notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of
    maturity. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of
    December 31, 2006 was $0.3 million.

    respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
    in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
    subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
    several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
    projected cash flows from these exposures. The fair value of the
    open forward contracts as of December 31, 2006 was
    $0.4 million. The following table presents our open forward
    currency



contracts as of December 31, 2006, which all mature in
    2007. Forward contract notional amounts presented below are
    expressed in the stated currencies (in thousands).

CONTROLS AND
    PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
    provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
    disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
    assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
    are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting is set forth on

page F-2

of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and is incorporated by reference herein.

(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
    Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the framework established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria
    in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
    Incorporated:

We have completed integrated audits of Teleflex
    Incorporated’s consolidated financial statements and of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
    opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and December 25,
    2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 25,
    2005 and December 26, 2004 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
    listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting, appearing on

page F-2,

that the Company maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
    Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
    is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
    of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
    control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
    the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
    performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

F-3


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in
    thousands, except per share)

Note 1 —
    Summary of significant accounting policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
    subsidiaries (the “Company”). Also, in accordance with
    Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R),
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” the
    Company consolidates variable interest entities in which it
    bears a majority of the risk of the potential losses or gains
    from a majority of the expected returns. Intercompany
    transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
    affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
    not a controlling equity interest are carried on the equity
    basis. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not
    have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
    These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America and include management’s estimates
    and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company eliminated the
    one-month lag for certain of its foreign operations to coincide
    with the timing of reporting for all of the Company’s other
    operations. As a result, the Company’s consolidated results
    for 2004 include the results of those operations for the month
    of December 2003 and the entire twelve months of 2004, whereas
    the Company’s consolidated results for 2005 and 2006
    include the results of those operations for the entire twelve
    months of 2005 and 2006, respectively. This change increased the
    Company’s consolidated revenues for 2004 by $16,879 and
    reduced the Company’s consolidated income from continuing
    operations before taxes and minority interest for 2004 by $1,114.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair values:

The estimated fair value amounts
    presented in these consolidated financial statements have been
    determined by the Company using available market information and
    appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
    required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of
    fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or
    estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair value amounts. Such fair value estimates are
    based on pertinent information available to management as of
    December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid
    debt instruments with an original maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of
    cash equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable
    represents amounts due from customers related to the sale of
    products. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained and
    represents the Company’s estimate of probable losses on
    realization of the full receivable. The allowance is provided at
    such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists that
    such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of
    time. The allowance is based on the Company’s historical
    experience, the period an account is outstanding, the financial
    position of the customer and information provided by credit
    rating services. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $10,097
    and $10,090 as of December 31, 2006 and December 25,
    2005, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the
    lower of cost or market. The cost of the Company’s
    inventories is determined by the average cost method. Elements
    of cost in inventory include raw materials, direct labor, and
    manufacturing overhead. In estimating market value, the Company
    evaluates inventory for excess and obsolete quantities based on
    estimated usage and sales.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant
    and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated
    depreciation. Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer
    software during the application development stage generally are
    capitalized. Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer
    software are capitalized, provided that these enhancements
    result in additional functionality. Other additions and those
    improvements which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful
    lives of the assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
    straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
    plant and equipment are as follows: buildings —
    30 years; machinery and equipment — 5 to
    10 years; computer equipment and software — 3 to
    5 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the
    remaining lease periods. Repairs and maintenance costs are
    expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill
    and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
    amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually, or
    more frequently if there is a triggering event. Impairment
    losses, if any, are recorded as part of income from operations.
    The goodwill impairment test is applied to each of the
    Company’s reporting units. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment, or a business one level below that operating
    segment (the component level) if discrete financial information
    is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
    However, components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if
    they have similar economic characteristics. The goodwill
    impairment test is applied using a two-step approach. In the
    first step, the Company estimates the fair values of its
    reporting units using the present value of future cash flows
    approach. If the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair
    value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is
    performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any.
    In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is
    estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the
    first step less the fair values of all net tangible and
    intangible assets of the reporting unit other than goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair
    market value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
    equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the
    goodwill. For other indefinite lived intangible assets, the
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible assets to their carrying amounts.

The Company performed an annual impairment test of its recorded
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter of 2006 and determined that a portion of its goodwill
    was impaired. The Company recorded a charge of $1,003, which is
    included in restructuring and impairment charges. The Company
    performed an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2005
    and found no instances of impairment. In connection with the
    Company’s 2004 restructuring and divestiture program, the
    Company determined in the fourth quarter of 2004 that a portion
    of its goodwill was impaired and recorded a charge of $18,582,
    $14,122 of which was included in restructuring and impairment
    charges and $4,460 of which was included in discontinued
    operations.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
    lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 30 years,
    with a weighted average amortization period of 13 years.
    The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the
    useful lives of these assets.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize
    long-lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or
    circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their
    carrying amount. Such evaluation is based on various analyses,
    including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections
    that incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing
    business. The analyses necessarily involve significant
    management judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
    exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

Product warranty
    liability arises out of the need to repair or replace product
    without charge to the customer. The Company warrants such
    products from manufacturing defect. The Company estimates its
    warranty liability based on historical trends of units sold, the
    status of existing claims, recall programs and communication
    with customers.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and
    liabilities of non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of
    exchange at the balance sheet date; income and expenses are
    translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during
    the year. The resultant translation adjustments are reported as
    a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
    shareholders’ equity.

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for
    other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on
    the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
    income, based on whether the instrument is designated as part of
    a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.
    Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other
    comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period
    in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item.
    The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current
    period earnings. If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly
    effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction
    will no longer occur, gains or losses on the derivative are
    recorded in current period earnings.

Stock-based compensation:

On December 26,
    2005, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires
    the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards made to employees based on estimated fair
    values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes previous accounting
    under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. In March
    2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    No. 107, providing supplemental guidance for
    SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has applied the
    provisions of SAB No. 107 in its adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the
    fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an
    option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that
    is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service periods. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
    application method, which requires the application of the
    standard starting from December 26, 2005, the first day of
    the Company’s 2006 fiscal year. The Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for 2006 reflect the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock
    options recognized under SFAS No. 123(R) for 2006 was
    $6,776 and is included in selling, engineering and
    administrative expenses. The total income tax benefit recognized
    for share-based compensation arrangements for 2006 was $1,373.
    As of December 31, 2006, total unamortized stock-based
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of
    expected forfeitures, was $9,202, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company
    accounted for stock-based awards to employees using the
    intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25, as
    allowed under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.” Under the intrinsic value
    method, no stock-based compensation expense for employee stock
    options had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated
    statements of operations because the exercise price of the
    Company’s stock options granted to employees equaled the
    fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
    In accordance with the modified prospective transition method
    the

Company used in adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company’s results of operations prior to fiscal 2006 have
    not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is
    based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is
    ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in 2006 included compensation
    expense for (1) stock-based awards granted prior to, but
    not yet vested as of December 25, 2005, based on the fair
    value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro
    forma provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
    (2) compensation expense for the stock-based awards granted
    subsequent to December 25, 2005, based on the fair value on
    the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R). As stock-based compensation expense
    recognized for fiscal 2006 is based on awards ultimately
    expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

The following table illustrates the pro forma net income and
    earnings per share for 2005 and 2004 as if compensation expense
    for stock options issued to employees had been determined
    consistent with SFAS No. 123:

Stock-based compensation expense is measured using a multiple
    point Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account
    highly subjective and complex assumptions. The expected life of
    options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award,
    as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the
    period of time that options granted are expected to be
    outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on a blend of
    historical volatility and implied volatility derived from
    publicly traded options to purchase the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes is more reflective of the
    market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility
    than solely using historical volatility. The risk-free interest
    rate is the implied yield currently available on
    U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term
    equal to the expected life of the option.

The fair value for options granted in 2006 was estimated at the
    date of grant using a multiple point Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. The fair value for options granted in 2005 and
    2004 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions
    were used:

On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. FAS 123(R)-3,

“Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects
    of Share-Based Payment Awards,” that allows for a
    simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the
    additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC Pool”) related
    to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation and to
    determine the subsequent impact on the APIC Pool and
    consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
    employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding
    upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). During the second
    quarter of 2006, the Company elected to adopt the simplified
    method.

See Note 11 for additional information regarding the
    Company’s stock compensation plans.

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes
    is determined using the asset and liability approach of
    accounting for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
    Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax
    consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for
    income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the
    current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
    Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and
    tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are
    adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are
    enacted. Provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted
    earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries
    in which earnings are deemed to be permanently invested.

Pensions and other postretirement
    benefits:

The Company provides a range of
    benefits to eligible employees and retired employees, including
    pensions and postretirement healthcare. The Company records
    annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations
    which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, compensation
    increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. The
    Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and
    makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates
    and trends when appropriate. As required, the effect of the
    modifications is generally amortized over future periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs,
    which include termination benefits, contract termination costs
    and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair
    value. Key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs
    include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain
    contractual obligations and the timing of employees leaving the
    company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes
    revenues from product sales, including sales to distributors, or
    services provided when the following revenue recognition
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
    selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
    reasonably assured. This generally occurs when products are
    shipped, when services are rendered or upon customers’
    acceptance.

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns and other
    allowances based on historical experience and current trends,
    are recognized upon shipment of products to customers or
    distributors. Revenues from services provided are recognized as
    the services are rendered and comprised less than 10% of total
    revenues for all periods presented.

The Company considers the criteria presented in
    SFAS No. 48, “Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists,” in determining the appropriate revenue
    recognition treatment. The Company’s normal policy is to
    accept returns only in cases in which the product is defective
    and covered under the Company’s standard warranty
    provisions. However, in the limited cases where an arrangement
    provides a right of return to the customer, including a
    distributor, the Company believes it has the ability to
    reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on its
    substantial historical experience with respect to these
    arrangements. The Company accrues

any costs or losses that may be expected in connection with any
    returns in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies.” Revenues and
    Materials, labor and other product costs are reduced to reflect
    estimated returns.

The Company applies the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given from a Vendor to a
    Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
    Products),” to its customer incentive programs, which
    include discounts or rebates. Appropriate allowances are
    determined and recorded as a reduction of revenue.

Revisions and reclassifications:

The Company
    revised its 2005 consolidated balance sheet to adjust for the
    netting of non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities. In
    addition, certain reclassifications have been made to the prior

    current year presentation. Certain financial information is
    presented on a rounded basis, which may cause minor differences.

Note 2 —
    New accounting standards

Inventory costs:

In November 2004, the FASB
    issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an
    amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which
    clarifies the types of costs that should be expensed rather than
    capitalized as inventory. This statement also clarifies the
    circumstances under which fixed overhead costs associated with
    operating facilities involved in inventory processing should be
    capitalized. The provisions of SFAS No. 151 are
    effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
    The Company adopted the provisions of this statement on
    December 26, 2005, and it did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows.

Stock-based compensation:

In December 2004,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment,” which establishes accounting standards for
    transactions in which an entity receives employee services in
    exchange for (a) equity instruments of the entity or
    (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
    entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
    issuance of equity instruments. SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires an entity to recognize the grant-date fair value of
    stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to
    employees in the statement of income. The statement also
    requires that such transactions be accounted for using the
    fair-value-based method, thereby eliminating use of the
    intrinsic value method of accounting in APB No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” which was
    permitted under Statement 123, as originally issued.
    SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted the
    provisions of this statement on December 26, 2005 using
    modified prospective application. See the “Stock-based
    compensation” section of Note 1 above for information
    regarding the effect of adoption on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

Accounting changes and error corrections:

In
    May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.”
    SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
    “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3,
    “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
    Statements” and changes the requirements of the accounting
    for and reporting of a change in accounting principle.
    SFAS No. 154 also provides guidance on the accounting
    for and reporting of error corrections. The provisions of this
    statement are applicable for accounting changes and error
    corrections made in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of
    this statement on December 26, 2005, and it did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments:

In
    February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments.”
    SFAS No. 155 provides entities with relief from having
    to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative
    that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host
    contract in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
    SFAS No. 155 allows an entity to make an irrevocable
    election to

F-14


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its
    entirety, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The
    election may be made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and can be made only when a hybrid financial instrument is
    initially recognized or when certain events occur that
    constitute a remeasurement (i.e., new basis) event for a
    previously recognized hybrid financial instrument. An entity
    must document its election to measure a hybrid financial
    instrument at fair value, either concurrently or via a
    preexisting policy for automatic election. Once the fair value
    election has been made, that hybrid financial instrument may not
    be designated as a hedging instrument pursuant to
    SFAS No. 133. Additionally, SFAS No. 155
    requires that interests in securitized financial assets be
    evaluated to identify whether they are freestanding derivatives
    or hybrid financial instruments containing an embedded
    derivative that requires bifurcation (previously, these were
    exempt from SFAS No. 133). When determining whether an
    interest in securitized financial assets is a hybrid financial
    instrument, SFAS No. 155 does not consider a
    concentration of credit risk, in the form of subordination of
    one interest in securitized assets to another, to be an embedded
    derivative. The provisions of this statement are applicable for
    all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a
    remeasurement (new basis) event occurring in fiscal years
    beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company will adopt
    this standard on January 1, 2007 and does not expect the
    provisions of this statement to have a material impact on the
    Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Uncertain Tax Positions:

In June 2006, the
    FASB issued FIN No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes.” FIN No. 48 requires that the
    impact of a tax position be recognized in the financial
    statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position
    will be sustained on tax audit, based on the technical merits of
    the position. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of tax positions that do not meet the “more
    likely than not” standard, classification of tax assets and
    liabilities, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of
    FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Fair Value Measurements:

In September 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes
    guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
    regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does
    not require any new fair value measurements but eliminates
    inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
    pronouncements. The provisions of this statement are effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 157 on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

Quantifying Misstatements:

In September 2006,
    the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior
    Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
    Year Financial Statements,” which is aimed at eliminating
    the diversity in practice of quantifying an identified
    misstatement by putting forward a single quantification
    framework to be used by all public companies. The provisions of
    SAB No. 108 are effective for annual financial
    statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
    November 15, 2006. The Company adopted the provisions of
    this statement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and it
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans:

In September 2006, the FASB issued
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires the
    recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan in
    the statement of financial position, requires that changes in
    the funded status be recognized through comprehensive income,
    changes the measurement date for defined benefit plan assets and
    obligations

F-15


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to the entity’s fiscal year-end and expands disclosures.
    The recognition and disclosures under SFAS No. 158 are
    required as of the end of the fiscal year ending after
    December 15, 2006 while the new measurement date is
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
    The new measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158
    will not affect the Company, as the measurement date for the
    Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement plan
    assets and obligations is currently the Company’s fiscal
    year-end. The Company adopted the recognition and disclosure
    provisions of this statement as of December 31, 2006 and
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax
    as of December 31, 2006, the gains and losses and prior
    service costs and credits that pursuant to SFAS No. 87
    and 106 have not been recognized as components of net periodic
    benefit cost. The Company also recognized in its consolidated
    balance sheet an asset or a liability that represents the funded
    status of its various defined benefit pension and postretirement
    plans. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the
    effect of adopting the recognition and disclosure provisions of
    this statement.

    Acquisitions

Acquisition
    of Taut, Inc.

On November 8, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition
    of Taut, Inc. (“Taut”), a producer of instruments and
    devices for minimally invasive surgical procedures, particularly
    laparoscopic surgery, for $28,002. The results for Taut are
    included in the Company’s Medical Segment.

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method
    of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    “Business Combinations.” The following table presents
    the preliminary allocation of purchase price for the Taut
    acquisition based on estimated fair values:

    surgical business. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Of
    the $11,780 in intangible assets, $6,918 and $344 were assigned
    to technology and customer relationships, respectively, with
    estimated remaining amortizable lives of 5 years. $4,518
    was assigned to trade names with indefinite useful lives.

    Restructuring and Divestiture Program

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced and
    commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture
    program designed to improve future operating performance and
    position the Company for future earnings growth. The actions
    have included exiting or divesting of non-core or low performing
    businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations and
    reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to
    share services.

Certain costs associated with the 2004 restructuring and
    divestiture program are not included in restructuring and
    impairment charges. All inventory adjustments that resulted from
    the 2004 restructuring and divestiture program and certain other
    costs associated with closing out businesses during 2005 and
    2004 are included in materials, labor and other product costs
    and totaled $2,000 and $17,040, respectively. The $2,000 in
    costs for 2005 related to the Company’s Aerospace Segment.
    Of the $17,040 in costs for 2004, $4,537 and $12,503 were

    December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with these
    provisions. Under the most restrictive of these provisions,
    $148,000 of retained earnings was available for dividends and
    stock repurchases at December 31, 2006.

Notes payable at December 31, 2006 consists of demand loans
    due to banks of $24,324 at an average interest rate of 5.2%. In
    addition, the Company has approximately $571,000 available under

Note 10 —
    Shareholders’ equity

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
    100,000,000 common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
    preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
    during the last three years.

On July 25, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $140 million of
    outstanding Company common stock over twelve months ended July
    2006. In June 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    extended for an additional six months, until January 2007, its
    authorization for the repurchase of shares. Under the approved
    plan, the Company repurchased (in thousands) a total of
    2,317 shares on the open market during 2005 and 2006 for an
    aggregate purchase price of $140,000, and aggregate fees and
    commissions of $69.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
    the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
    manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
    increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
    and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
    assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
    reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
    outstanding is as follows:

The Company has stock-based compensation plans that provide for
    the granting of incentive and non-qualified options to officers
    and key employees to purchase up to 4,000,000 shares of
    common stock at the market price of the stock on the dates

At December 31, 2006, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside the United States, for which no income or
    withholding taxes have been provided, approximated $321,000.
    Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and as
    a result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
    regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
    to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
    such earnings were remitted to the United States.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
    operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
    for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
    subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
    taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 31, 2006,
    the tax effect of such carry forwards approximated $116,842. Of
    this amount, $6,009 has no expiration date, $3,303 expires after
    2006 but before the end of 2011 and $107,530 expires after 2011.
    A substantial amount of these carryforwards consist of tax
    losses which were acquired in an acquisition by the Company in
    2004. Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes is
    subject to an annual limitation imposed by Section 382 of
    the Internal Revenue Code. It is not expected that this annual
    limitation will prevent the Company from utilizing its
    carryforwards. The determination of state net operating loss
    carryforwards are dependent upon the
    U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income or loss,
    apportionment percentages and other respective state laws, which
    can change year to year and impact the amount of such
    carryforward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $51,323 and
    $32,598 at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005,
    respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the
    utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss
    and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation
    allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 109, which requires that a valuation
    allowance be established and maintained when it is “more
    likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax
    assets will

F-27


TELEFLEX
    INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

not be realized. The valuation allowance increase in 2006 was
    primarily attributable to the recording of deferred tax assets
    associated with state tax loss carryforwards at full value which
    required a valuation allowance.

Several foreign subsidiaries continue to operate under separate
    tax holiday arrangements as granted by certain foreign
    jurisdictions. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary
    and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in future years
    according to the specific terms and schedules as set forth by
    the particular taxing authorities having jurisdiction over the
    arrangements. The most significant arrangement expires in March
    2008.

Note 13 —
    Pension and other postretirement benefits

The Company has a number of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans covering eligible U.S. and

non-U.S. employees.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
    benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of
    service and employees’ pay near retirement. The
    Company’s funding policy for U.S. plans is to
    contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts required by
    applicable laws and regulations. Obligations under

non-U.S. plans

are systematically provided for by depositing funds with
    trustees or by book reserves.

The parent Company and certain subsidiaries provide medical,
    dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
    The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
    from Company funds.

The following table illustrates the incremental effect of

The discount rate for U.S. plans of 5.85% was established
    by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments to the
    Citigroup Pension Discount Curve (published monthly) as of
    December 31, 2006. The expected benefit payments are
    discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield
    curve. Once the present value of the string of benefit payments
    is established, the Company solves for the single spot rate to
    apply to all obligations of the plan that will exactly match the
    previously determined present value.

The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve is constructed beginning
    with a U.S. Treasury par curve that reflects the entire
    Treasury and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and
    Principal Securities (“STRIPS”) market. From the
    Treasury curve, Citibank produces a AA corporate par curve by
    adding option-adjusted spreads that are drawn from the AA
    corporate sector of the Citigroup Broad Investment —
    Grade Bond Index. Finally, from the AA corporate par curve,
    Citigroup derives the spot rates that constitute the Pension
    Discount Curve. For payments beyond 30 years the Company
    extends the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in
    year 30 is extended to the end of the plan’s payment
    expectations.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
    increase the benefit obligation by $2,678 and would increase the
    2006 benefit expense by $253. Decreasing the trend rate by 1%
    would decrease the benefit obligation by $2,265 and would
    decrease the 2006 benefit expense by $135.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
    defined benefit pension plans was $221,942 and $193,536 for 2006
    and 2005, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
    obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and foreign
    plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
    assets were $233,399, $221,942 and $161,837, respectively for
    2006 and $205,457, $192,039 and $141,804, respectively for 2005.

Plan assets are allocated among various categories of equities,
    fixed income, cash and cash equivalents with professional
    investment managers whose performance is actively monitored. The
    target allocation among plan assets allows for variances based
    on economic and market trends. The primary investment objective
    is long-term growth of assets in order to meet present and
    future benefit obligations. The Company periodically

The Company’s contributions to U.S. and foreign pension
    plans during 2007 are expected to be in the range of
    $10 million to $14 million. Contributions to
    postretirement healthcare plans during 2007 are expected to be
    approximately $2 million.

The Company’s expected benefit payments for U.S. and
    foreign plans for each of the five succeeding years and the
    aggregate of the five years thereafter, net of the annual
    Medicare Part D subsidy of approximately $220, is as

non-U.S. employees.

The Company partially matches employee contributions. Costs
    related to these plans were $9,132, $8,914 and $9,952 for 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note 14 —
    Commitments and contingent liabilities

Product warranty liability:

The Company
    warrants to the original purchaser of certain of its products
    that it will, at its option, repair or replace, without charge,
    such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect.
    Warranty periods vary by product. The Company has recourse
    provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from
    third parties for amounts paid under the warranty. The Company
    accrues for product warranties when, based on available
    information, it is probable that customers will make claims
    under warranties relating to products that have been sold, and a
    reasonable estimate of the costs (based on historical claims
    experience relative to sales) can be made. Set forth below is a
    reconciliation of the Company’s estimated product warranty
    liability for 2006:

Operating leases:

The Company uses various
    leased facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for
    these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. In
    connection with these operating leases, the Company has residual
    value guarantees in the amount of $4,771 at December 31,
    2006. The Company’s future payments cannot exceed the
    minimum rent obligation plus the residual value guarantee
    amount. The guarantee amounts are tied to the unamortized lease
    values of the assets under lease, and are due should the Company
    decide neither to renew these leases, nor to exercise its
    purchase option. At December 31, 2006, the Company had no
    liabilities recorded for these obligations. Any residual value
    guarantee amounts paid to the lessor may be recovered by the
    Company from the sale of the assets to a third party.

Future minimum lease payments (including residual value
    guarantee amounts) under noncancelable operating leases are as
    follows:

Rental expense under operating leases was $38,850, $36,734 and
    $40,827 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Accounts receivable securitization
    program:

The Company uses an accounts receivable
    securitization program to gain access to enhanced credit markets
    and reduce financing costs. As currently structured, the Company
    sells certain trade receivables on a non-recourse basis to a
    consolidated special purpose entity, which in turn sells an
    interest in those receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The
    conduit issues notes secured by that interest to third party
    investors. The assets of the special purpose entity are not
    available to satisfy the obligations of the Company. In
    accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” transfers of assets
    under the program qualify as sales of receivables and
    accordingly, $40,068 of accounts receivable and the related
    amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from
    the consolidated balance sheet as of both December 31, 2006
    and December 25, 2005.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to
    contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations
    that in the future may require the Company to take further
    action to correct the effects on the environment of prior
    disposal practices or releases of chemical or petroleum
    substances by the Company or other parties. Much of this
    liability results from the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),
    often referred to as Superfund, the U.S. Resource
    Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and similar
    state laws. These laws require the Company to undertake certain
    investigative and remedial activities at sites where the Company
    conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where
    Company-generated waste was disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
    from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
    depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
    remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
    enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
    potentially responsible parties. At December 31, 2006 and
    December 25, 2005, the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheet included an accrued liability of $7,417 and $6,317,
    respectively, relating to these matters. Considerable
    uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and, under
    adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed
    the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. The time-frame
    over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be
    paid out, based on past history, is estimated to be

15-20 years.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various
    lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business.
    These lawsuits and claims include actions involving product
    liability, intellectual property, employment and environmental
    matters. Based on information currently available, advice of
    counsel, established reserves and other resources, the Company
    does not believe that any such actions are likely to be,
    individually or in the aggregate, material to its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is
    possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other
    similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to
    the Company’s business, financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel
    fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

In February 2004, a jury verdict of $34,800 was rendered against
    one of the Company’s subsidiaries in a trademark
    infringement action. In February 2005, the trial judge entered
    an order rejecting the jury award in its entirety. In October
    2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
    upheld the February 2005 decision. As no appeal of the Court of
    Appeals’ decision was filed within the requisite time for
    filing appeals in this matter, the decision has become final.

Other:

The Company has various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and items of permanent
    investment incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the
    aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of
    current market.

Note 15 —

    Discontinued operations and assets held for sale

In October 2006, the Company sold a small medical business that
    was classified as held for sale during the second quarter of
    2005 and recognized a loss on the sale of $481. The Company
    previously recognized a $956 reduction in the carrying value of
    this business to the estimated fair value of the business less
    costs to sell. During 2006, the Company recognized a loss on
    disposal of $484 in connection with a post-closing purchase
    price adjustment based on working capital for its divested
    automotive pedal systems business. Also during 2006, the Company
    recognized a pre-tax gain of $917 related to the first quarter
    2005 divestiture of Sermatech International, a
    surface-engineering/specialty coatings business and recognized a
    pre-tax gain of $230 related to the third quarter 2005
    divestiture of a European medical product sterilization business.

In August 2005, the Company completed the sale of its automotive
    pedal systems business and received $7,500 in gross proceeds.
    The Company recognized a $20,874 reduction in the carrying value
    of this business to the estimated fair value of the business
    less costs to sell and recognized a loss on the sale of $1,686
    in 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold a
    European medical product sterilization business that was
    classified as held for sale during the second quarter of 2005
    and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $2,122 in 2005.
    During the second quarter of 2005, the Company adopted a plan to
    sell a small medical business and recognized a loss of $4,560 in
    2005 based upon the excess of the carrying value of the business
    as compared to the estimated fair value of the business less
    costs to sell. On February 28, 2005, the Company completed
    the sale of Sermatech International, received gross proceeds of
    $79,868 and recorded a net gain on the sale of $34,415 in 2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a loss
    of $50,531 based upon a write-down of the automotive pedal
    systems business from its carrying value to the estimated fair
    value of the business less

costs to sell. $44,466 of the write-down applied to long-lived
    assets, consisting primarily of machinery and equipment.

For financial statement purposes, the assets, liabilities,
    results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have
    been segregated from those of continuing operations and are
    presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities
    held for sale.

Revenues of discontinued operations were $3,980, $112,515 and
    $227,967 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating income
    (loss) from discontinued operations was $(483), $2,304 and
    $(68,262) for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As part of the Company’s 2006 restructuring program, the
    Company determined that assets totaling $4,062 met the criteria
    for held for sale classification during 2006. The assets are
    comprised primarily of land and a building that are no longer
    being used in the Company’s operations. In December 2006,
    the Company sold these assets and recognized a loss on the sale
    of $106. Also during 2006, the Company sold assets, including
    assets held for sale totaling $3,007, and recognized an
    aggregate net loss on these sales of $732. The Company is
    actively marketing its remaining assets held for sale.

As part of the Company’s 2004 restructuring and divestiture
    program, the Company determined that assets totaling $32,789 met
    the criteria for held for sale classification during 2005. The
    assets are comprised primarily of land and buildings that are no
    longer being used in the Company’s operations. The Company
    determined that the carrying value of each asset held for sale
    did not exceed the estimated fair value of the asset less costs
    to sell and therefore did not adjust the carrying value of the
    asset in 2005.

In October 2005, the Company completed the sale of a product
    line in its Medical Segment. The Company received gross proceeds
    of $10,265 and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $8,989.
    Also during 2005, the Company sold assets, including assets held
    for sale totaling $12,942, and recognized an aggregate net gain
    on these sales of $5,234.

During 2004, the Company sold six non-strategic businesses
    resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $2,733. No individual
    transaction resulted in a material gain or loss.

Assets and liabilities held for sale are comprised of the
