well as other industrial markets.

For more than 60 years, we have grown by providing
engineered products that help our customers meet their business
requirements. We have grown through an active program of
development of new products, introduction of products into new
geographic or end-markets and through acquisitions of companies
that can add value with related market, technology or industry
expertise. We serve a diverse customer base through operations
in 24 countries and local direct sales and distribution
networks. In 2005, products distributed from our operations in
the United States accounted for 45 percent of revenues, and
products distributed from our operations in other countries
represented 55 percent of revenues.

Our Business Segments

We classify our business into three business
segments — Commercial, Medical and Aerospace. For
2005, the percentages of our consolidated net revenues
represented by our segments were as follows:
Commercial — 47%; Medical — 33%; and
Aerospace — 20%. Additional information regarding our
segments is presented in Note 14 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Commercial

Our Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
manufacture and distribute driver control, motion control, power
and vehicle management and fluid management products and
systems. Our products are used by a wide range of markets
including the passenger car and light truck, marine,
recreational, mobile power equipment, military, agricultural and
construction vehicle, truck and bus and various other industrial
equipment sectors. These products are provided through business
operating units organized around geographical location, market
knowledge and technical expertise. Major manufacturing
operations are located in North America, Europe and Asia.

Driver Controls:

This is the largest single product
category in the Commercial Segment, representing 47 percent
of Commercial Segment revenues in 2005. Products in this
category include: full manual and automatic gearshift systems,
transmission guide controls, park-lock cables, control cables,

window, door, function and other safety controls and mobile
power equipment controls and products for heavy-lift
applications. While the largest portion of this category relates
to seat and interior comfort and motion systems sold to
automotive suppliers and industrial vehicle manufac-



turers, our motion systems also serve a wide range of other
markets and applications. For example, we are a large supplier
of safety cable and light-duty motion controls used in mobile
power equipment, and our heavy-lift products, which include
heavy-duty cables, hoisting and rigging equipment, are used in
oil drilling and other industrial markets.

Power and Vehicle Management Systems:

Products in this
category represented 18 percent of Commercial Segment
revenues in 2005. Power and vehicle management systems include:
mobile auxiliary power systems, fuel management systems and
components, industrial actuation products and components,
instrumentation and electronic controls for engine and vehicle
management, diagnostics and monitoring. These products generally
address the need for greater fuel efficiency, reduced emissions,
mobile power and improved connectivity of engine and vehicle
systems. Our major products in this category include mobile
auxiliary power units used for power and climate control in
heavy duty trucks, industrial vehicles and locomotives,
instrumentation and electronic products for marine and
industrial vehicles and components and systems for the use of
alternative fuels in military, industrial and automotive
applications.

Fluid Management Systems:

Products in this category
represented 11 percent of Commercial Segment revenues in

The following table sets forth the percentage of revenues by end
market for 2005 for the Commercial Segment.

Backlog:

As of December 25, 2005, our backlog of
firm orders for our Commercial Segment was $257 million.
This compares with $226 million as of December 26,
2004. Standard Commercial products are typically shipped between
two weeks and three months after receipt of order. Therefore,
the backlog of such orders is not indicative of probable
revenues in any future

12-month

period.



Marketing:

The majority of our Commercial Segment
products are sold to original equipment manufacturers through a
direct sales force of field representatives and technical
specialists. We also market our marine products through dealers,
distributors and retail outlets serving owners of recreational
boats. Our mobile auxiliary power units and climate control
units are marketed by our field sales force to dealers and
owners of heavy duty trucks and industrial vehicles. Fuel
systems and components include custom applications sold directly
to military customers and to the automotive aftermarket in
Europe.

Medical

Our Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
distribute disposable medical products, surgical instruments,
medical devices and specialty devices for healthcare providers
and medical equipment manufacturers. Our products are largely
sold and distributed to hospitals and healthcare providers in a
range of clinical settings. These products are provided through
business operating units organized around product category,
market knowledge, geographical location and technical expertise.
Major manufacturing operations are located in North America,
Europe and Asia.

Markets for these products are influenced by a number of factors
including demographics, utilization and reimbursement patterns
in the worldwide healthcare market.

Disposable Medical Products:

This is the largest product
category in the Medical Segment, representing 61 percent of
segment revenues in 2005. Our disposable medical products are
generally used in the clinical specialty areas of anesthesia,
respiratory care and urology. Anesthesia and respiratory care
products include those used in airway management, oxygen
administration and therapy, humidification and aerosol therapy.
Urology products include: catheters, drain and irrigation
supplies. Our products are marketed under the brand names of
Rusch, HudsonRCI, Gibeck and Sheridan. The large majority of
sales for disposable medical products are made to the hospital/
healthcare provider market with a smaller percentage to the home
health market and medical device manufacturers.

Backlog:

As of December 25, 2005, our backlog of
firm orders for our Medical Segment was $65 million. This
compares with $65 million as of December 26, 2004.
Substantially all of the December 25, 2005 backlog will be
filled in 2006. Most of our medical products are sold on orders
calling for delivery within a few months. Therefore, the backlog
of such orders is not indicative of probable revenues in any
future

12-month

period.

Marketing:

Medical products are sold directly to
hospitals, healthcare providers, distributors and to original
equipment manufacturers of medical devices through our own sales
forces and through independent representatives and independent
distributor networks.

Aerospace

Our Aerospace Segment businesses provide repair products and
services for flight and ground-based turbine engines;
manufacture and distribute precision-machined components; and
design, manufacture and market cargo-handling systems. These
products require a high degree of engineering sophistication and
are often custom-designed. They are provided through business
operating units organized by market and technical expertise.
Major operations are located in North America, Europe and Asia.

Commercial aviation markets represent the majority percentage of
revenues in this segment. Markets for these products are
generally influenced by spending patterns in the commercial
aviation and military markets.

Repair Products and Services:

The largest single product
category in the Aerospace Segment, repair products and services
represented 49 percent of segment revenues in 2005. This
category includes repair technologies and services primarily for
critical components of flight turbines, including fan blades and
airfoils. We utilize advanced reprofiling and adaptive-machining
techniques to improve efficiency of aircraft engine performance
and reduce turnaround time for maintenance and repairs. Repair
products and services are provided through service locations in
North America, Europe and Asia. Our repair products and services
business is conducted through a consolidated, but not
wholly-owned, subsidiary called Airfoil Technologies
International (ATI), whose product line serves many of the
industry’s leading aircraft engine providers and a range of
commercial airlines.

Precision-Machined Components:

Products in this category
represented 26 percent of Aerospace Segment revenues in
2005. Our precision-machined components include: fan blades,
compressor blades, cases, blisks and other components for
military and commercial flight turbine engines and a range of
custom-designed and manufactured products for industrial
markets. The vast majority of our precision-machined components
are sold to original equipment manufacturers of aircraft engines
and for military applications, with a very small percentage of
products sold to industrial markets.

Cargo-handling Systems:

Products in this category
represented 25 percent of Aerospace Segment revenues in
2005. Our cargo-handling systems include on-board cargo-handling
systems for wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, actuators, cargo
containers, aftermarket spare parts and repair services.
Marketed under the Telair International brand name, our
wide-body cargo-handling systems are sold to aircraft original
equipment manufacturers or to airlines and air freight carriers
as “buyer furnished equipment” for original
installations or as retrofits for existing equipment. Our other
Telair products in this category include: narrow-body aircraft
cargo-loading systems and cargo containers. We also manufacture
and repair components for



our systems and other related aircraft controls, including
canopy and door actuators, cargo winches and flight controls.

Backlog:

As of December 25, 2005, our backlog of
firm orders for our Aerospace Segment was $316 million, of
which we expect nearly three-fourths to be filled in 2006. Our
backlog for our Aerospace Segment on December 26, 2004 was
$289 million.

Marketing:

Generally, products sold to the aerospace
market are sold through our own force of field representatives.

Discontinued Operations

During the third quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our
automotive pedal systems business and sold a European medical
product sterilization business. During the second quarter of
2005, we adopted a plan to sell a small medical business and we
are actively marketing this business. During the first quarter
of 2005, we completed the sale of Sermatech International, a
surface-engineering/specialty coatings business. For 2005 and
comparable periods, the automotive pedal systems business, the
European medical product sterilization business, the small
medical business and Sermatech business have been presented in
our consolidated financial statements as discontinued
operations. The Sermatech business was previously reported as
part of our Aerospace Segment. For a more complete discussion,
see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Government Regulation

Government agencies in a number of countries regulate our
products and the products sold by our customers utilizing our
products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
government agencies in other countries regulate the approval,
manufacturing and sale and marketing of many of our healthcare
products. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the
European Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacturing and
sale of some of our aerospace products and license the operation
of our repair stations. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration regulates the manufacturing and sale of numerous
of our automotive products.

Competition

Given the range and diversity of our products and markets, no
one competitor offers competitive products for all the markets
and customers that we serve. In general, all of our segments and
product lines face significant competition from competitors of
varying sizes, although the number of competitors in each market
tends to be limited. We believe that our competitive position
depends on the technical competence



and creative ability of our engineering personnel, the know-how
and skill of our manufacturing personnel and the strength and
scope of our sales, service and distribution networks.

Patents and Trademarks

We own a portfolio of patents, patents pending and trademarks.
We also license various patents and trademarks. Patents for
individual products extend for varying periods according to the
date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in
the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of
time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.
All capitalized product names throughout this document are
trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us or our subsidiaries.
Although these have been of value and are expected to continue
to be of value in the future, we do not consider any single
patent or trademark, except for the Teleflex brand, to be
material to the operation of our business.

Suppliers and Materials

Materials used in the manufacture of our products are purchased
from a large number of suppliers in diverse geographic
locations. We are not dependent on any single supplier for a
substantial amount of the materials used or components supplied
for our overall operations. Most of the materials and components
we use are available from multiple sources and where practical,
we attempt to identify alternative suppliers. Volatility in
commodity markets, particularly steel and plastic resins, can
have a significant impact on the cost of producing certain of
our products. We cannot be assured of successfully passing these
cost increases through to all of our customers, particularly
OEMs.

Seasonality

A portion of our revenues, particularly in the Commercial and
Medical segments, are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Revenues
in the automotive and industrial markets are generally reduced
in the third quarter of each year as a result of preparations by
OEM manufacturers for the upcoming model year. In addition,
marine aftermarket revenues generally increase in the second
quarter as boat owners prepare their watercraft for the upcoming
season. Incidence of flu and other disease patterns as well as
the frequency of elective medical procedures affect revenues
related to disposable medical products.

Employees

We employed approximately 20,400 full-time and temporary
employees at December 25, 2005. Of these employees,
approximately 8,100 were employed in the United States and
12,300 in countries outside of the United States. Less than
10 percent of our employees in the United States were
covered by union contracts. We have government-mandated
collective-bargaining arrangements or union contracts that cover
employees in other countries. We believe we have good
relationships with our employees.

Investor Information

We are subject to the informational requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, we file reports and
information, proxy statements and other information with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Such reports, proxy and
information statements and other information may be obtained by
visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street,

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to certain risks that could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the
following:

The costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture
program may be greater than expected.

We are engaged in a restructuring and divestiture program, which
requires management to utilize significant estimates related to
realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete and
expenses for severance and other employee separation costs,
lease cancellation and other exit costs. Although the program is
substantially completed, actual results could differ materially
from those estimated due to, among other things: inability to
sell businesses at prices, or within time-periods, anticipated
by management; unanticipated expenditures in connection with the
effectuation of the program; costs and length of time required
to comply with legal requirements applicable to certain aspects
of the program; inability to realize anticipated cost savings;
and unanticipated difficulties in connection with consolidation
of manufacturing and administrative functions.

Many of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and,
accordingly, our business is subject to changes in the
economy.

Although the diversified nature of our business reduces the risk
that all of our operations would experience simultaneous
cyclical downturns, many of the businesses which we operate are
subject to specific industry and general economic cycles, most
acutely in the automotive, marine, aerospace and transportation
industries. Accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets
in which we participate could materially adversely affect us.
Moreover, if demand changes and we fail to respond accordingly,
our results of operations could be materially adversely affected
in any given quarter.



We are subject to risks associated with our

non-U.S.

operations.

Although no material concentration of our manufacturing
operations exists in any single country, we have significant
manufacturing operations outside the United States, including
entities that are not wholly-owned and other alliances. As of
December 25, 2005, approximately 42% of our total assets
and 55% of our total revenues were attributable to products
distributed from our operations outside the U.S. Our
international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk
inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including:

These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on
our international operations or on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our products are typically integrated into other
manufacturers’ products. As a result changes in demand for
our customers’ products may adversely affect our revenues
on short notice.

Many of our customers in the Commercial and Aerospace segments,
including OEMs, integrate our products into products our
customers sell. Our customers also generally have no obligation
to purchase any minimum quantity of product from us and may
terminate our arrangement on short notice, typically 30 to
90 days, sometimes less. Our reported backlog may not be
realized as revenues. Revenues could materially decline if these
customers experience a reduction in demand for their products or
cancel a significant number of contracts and we cannot replace
them with similar arrangements.

Customers in our Medical Segment depend on third party
reimbursement.

Demand for some of our medical products is impacted by the
reimbursement to our customers of patients’ medical
expenses by government healthcare programs and private health
insurers in the countries where we do business. Internationally,
medical reimbursement systems vary significantly, with medical
centers in some countries having fixed budgets, regardless of
the level of patient treatment. Other countries require
application for, and approval of, government or third party
reimbursement. Without both favorable coverage determinations
by, and the financial support of, government and third party
insurers, the market for some of our medical products could be
impacted.

We cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the
current level of reimbursement to our customers for use of our
existing products. Adverse coverage determinations or any
reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our
business. In addition, through their purchasing power, these
payors often seek discounts, price reductions or other
incentives from medical products suppliers. Uncertainties
regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulations,
as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to
sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at
profitable prices.

Foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest
rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices and interest rates. We expect revenue from products
manufactured in, and sold into,

non-U.S.

markets
to continue to represent a significant portion of our net
revenue. Our consoli-



dated financial statements reflect translation of items
denominated in

non-U.S.

currencies
to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. When the
U.S. dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the
foreign currencies of the countries where we sell or manufacture
our products, such as the euro, our U.S. dollar-reported
revenue and income will fluctuate. Although we maintain a
currency hedging program to reduce the effects of this
fluctuation, changes in the relative values of currencies occur
from time to time and may, in some instances, have a significant
effect on our results of operations.

Many of our products have significant steel and plastic resin
content. We also use quantities of other commodities, including
copper and zinc. We monitor these exposures as an integral part
of our overall risk management program. However, volatility in
the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our
products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs
to our customers and this could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and cash flows.

We depend on our ability to develop new products.

The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our
ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and
to enhance existing products, including developing electronic
technology to replace or improve upon mechanical technology.
This product development may require substantial investment by
us. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not
occur with respect to the development, performance or market
acceptance of new technologies or products, such as the
inability to:

Moreover, we may not otherwise be able to successfully develop
and market new products. Our failure to successfully develop and
market new products could reduce our margins, which would have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our technology is important to our success and our failure to
protect this technology could put us at a competitive
disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we
believe that the development and protection of these
intellectual property rights is important to the future success
of our business. In addition to relying on patent, trademark and
copyright rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and
trade secrets, and employ various methods, including
confidentiality agreements with employees, to protect our
know-how and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect
proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy
or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology. The
steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of this
technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may
not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S., and
there can be no assurance that others will not independently
develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better
technology than us or that current and former employees,
contractors and other parties will not breach confidentiality
agreements, misappropriate proprietary information and copy or
otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary
technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our
intellectual property rights.

We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of
our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
actions involving product liability, contracts, intellectual
property, employment and environmental matters. The defense of
these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, and
we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits.
In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or



settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable
remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from our
expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including
regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product
liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought
against us.

We may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in
the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to
perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is
alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.
Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product
liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to
defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or
are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate
in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect
relates to safety. Product liability, warranty and recall costs
may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Much of our business is subject to extensive regulation
and/or oversight by the government and failure to comply with
those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

Numerous national and local government agencies in a number of
countries regulate our products and the products sold by our
customers incorporating our products. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration regulates the manufacturing and
sale of many of our automotive products. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration regulates the approval, manufacturing and
sale and marketing of many of our medical products. The
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European
Aviation Safety Agency regulate the manufacturing and sale of
some of our aerospace products and licenses the operation of our
repair stations. Failure to comply with applicable regulations
and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary
manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product
manufacturing.

We are also subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and
local environmental protection and health and safety laws
governing, among other things:

•

the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous
    materials;

•

emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and

•

the health and safety of our employees.

These laws and government regulations are complex, change
frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with
current or future environmental protection and health and safety
laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases
of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our
estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations or that we will not be subject to
additional environmental claims for personal injury or cleanup
in the future based on our past, present or future business
activities.

There is the possibility that acquisitions and strategic
alliances may not meet revenue and/or profit expectations.

As part of our strategy for growth, we have made and may
continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into
strategic alliances. However, there can be no assurance that
these will be completed or beneficial to us. We may not be able
to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete
acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in
the integration of the operations, technologies, services and
products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
management’s attention from other business concerns.
Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no
assurance that we will properly ascertain all



such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and
future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of
substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future
acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances
of equity securities. There can be no assurance that
difficulties encountered with acquisitions will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar
agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of
services.

Approximately 15% of manufacturing revenues are produced by
operations for which a significant part of our workforce is
covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar
agreements in foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that a
significant portion of our workforce will remain covered by
collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable
future. Strikes or work stoppages could occur that would
adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our
ability to conduct our business.

PROPERTIES

Our operations have approximately 168 owned and leased
properties consisting of plants, engineering and research
centers, distribution warehouses, offices and other facilities.
The properties are maintained in good operating condition and
are suitable for their intended use. All the plants have space
available for the activities currently conducted therein and
expected in the next several years.

Our major facilities are as follows:



In addition to the above, we own or lease approximately
1,385,000 square feet of warehousing, manufacturing and
office space located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South
America, Europe, Australia and Asia. We also own or lease
certain properties that are no longer being used in our
operations. We are actively marketing these owned properties and
seeking to sublease these leased properties. At
December 25, 2005, the owned properties were classified as
held for sale.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the
normal course of business. These lawsuits and claims include
actions involving product liability, intellectual property,
employment and environmental



matters. Based on information currently available, advice of
counsel, established reserves and other resources, we do not
believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or
in the aggregate, material to our business, financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of
unexpected further developments, it is possible that the
ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters,
if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to our business,
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In February 2004, a jury verdict of $34.8 million was
rendered against one of our subsidiaries in a trademark
infringement action. In February 2005, the trial judge entered
an order rejecting the jury award in its entirety. Both parties
have filed notice to appeal on various grounds. While we cannot
predict the outcome of the appeals, we will continue to
vigorously contest this litigation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth
through the continued development of our core businesses and
carefully selected acquisitions. Our internal growth initiatives
include the development of new products, moving existing
products into market adjacencies in which we already participate
with other products and the expansion of market share. Our core
revenue growth in 2005 as compared to 2004, excluding the
impacts of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, was 5%.
During the first six months of 2005, our results were benefited
by the contribution from the third quarter 2004 acquisition of
Hudson Respiratory Care Inc., or HudsonRCI, a leading provider
of disposable medical products for respiratory care and
anesthesia. Further in 2005, we acquired a small repair products
and services business in the Aerospace Segment for
$8.0 million.

During 2004, we commenced a portfolio review program that
resulted in the sale of a number of non-core businesses and
product lines in 2005:



In January and February 2005, we also completed the sale of two
small product lines in our Medical Segment and an industrial
cables business in our Commercial Segment. During the second
quarter of 2005, we adopted a plan to sell a small medical
business. We are actively marketing this business and recognized
a loss of $4.6 million in 2005 based upon the excess of the
carrying value of the business as compared to the estimated fair
value of the business less costs to sell. Additionally, we
recognized a $20.9 million reduction in the carrying value
of the automotive pedal systems business during 2005. For 2005
and comparable periods, the automotive pedal systems business,
the European medical product sterilization business, the small
medical business and Sermatech business have been presented in
our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced and commenced
implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program
designed to improve future operating performance and position us
for future earnings growth. The planned restructuring actions
have included exiting or divesting of non-core or low performing
businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations and
reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to
share services. The charges associated with the restructuring
program for continuing operations that are included in
restructuring costs during 2005 totaled $27.1 million, of
which 13%, 76% and 11% were attributable to our Commercial,
Medical and Aerospace segments, respectively.

On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $140 million of outstanding Teleflex
common stock over twelve months ending July 2006. Under the
approved plan, we repurchased 0.7 million shares on the
open market during 2005 for an aggregate purchase price of
$46.5 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we eliminated the one-month
lag for certain of our foreign operations to coincide with the
timing of reporting for all of our other operations. As a
result, our consolidated results for 2004 include the results of
those operations for the month of December 2003 and the entire
twelve months of 2004, whereas our consolidated results for 2003
include the results of those operations for the month of
December 2002 and the first eleven months of 2003 and our
consolidated results for 2005 include the results of those
operations for the entire twelve months of 2005. This change
increased our consolidated revenues for 2004 by
$16.9 million and reduced our consolidated income from
continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for
2004 by $1.1 million.

On October 22, 2004 the American Jobs Creation Act, or
AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85%
of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in
the AJCA. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations
and complexities, and during the past nine months, we have been
analyzing the previous guidance provided by the Treasury
Department and the potential impact of applying the repatriation
provision to unremitted foreign earnings held by our various
controlled foreign corporations. During the fourth quarter 2005,
management completed its analysis of the impact of the AJCA and
finalized and executed a repatriation plan. Under this plan, we
repatriated $304 million of dividends during November and
December 2005. Accordingly, we recorded a tax expense of
approximately $8.3 million during the fourth quarter of
2005 as a result of this repatriation. This tax expense was
offset by a tax benefit of approximately $14.1 million
related to excess foreign tax credits generated in connection
with this repatriation. Management obtained the requisite
corporate officer and Board of Directors approvals of the
domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe specified.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

We have identified the following as critical accounting
estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of
significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive
and important to the presenta-



tion of our financial condition and results of operations and
could potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions.

Inventory Utilization

Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments
and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence
rates. Based upon these judgments and estimates, we record a
reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories. We
regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against
historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order
to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing
historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends
to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information
as an estimate of future usage. Our inventory reserve was
$44.6 million and $61.3 million at December 25,
2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively. Dispositions and
currency fluctuations accounted for the majority of this decline.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

The ability to realize long-lived assets is evaluated
periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible
inability to recover their carrying amount. Such evaluation is
based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow and
profitability projections that incorporate, as applicable, the
impact on the existing business. The analyses necessarily
involve significant management judgment. Any impairment loss, if
indicated, is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the
asset.

Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,
or SFAS, No. 142, we perform an annual impairment test of
our recorded goodwill. In addition, we test our other
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. These
impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of
future performance, long-term discount rates and market price
valuation multiples. These estimates will likely change over
time. Many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and
the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate
as a result of this cyclicality. Goodwill and other intangible
assets totaled $712.0 million and $745.8 million at
December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively.

Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare.
Several statistical and other factors which attempt to
anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and
liability related to these plans. These factors include
actuarial assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates
and healthcare cost trend rates. We review the actuarial
assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the
assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate.

Significant differences in our actual experience or significant
changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and
other postretirement obligations and our future expense. A 50
basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease
the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare
expense for 2005 by approximately $1.1 million and would
decrease the projected benefit obligation at December 25,
2005 by approximately $12.3 million. A 50 basis point
decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase these
amounts by approximately $1.1 million and
$13.5 million, respectively. A 50 basis point change in the
expected return on plan assets would impact 2005 annual pension
expense by approximately $0.6 million. A 1.0% increase in
the assumed healthcare trend rate would increase the 2005
benefit expense by approximately $0.1 million and would
increase the projected benefit obligation by approximately
$2.1 million. A 1.0% decrease in the assumed healthcare
trend rate would decrease the 2005 benefit expense



by approximately $0.1 million and would decrease the
projected benefit obligation by approximately $1.8 million.

Accounting for Restructuring Costs

Restructuring costs, which include termination benefits,
contract termination costs, asset impairments and other
restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value. Key
assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the
terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual
obligations, the realizable value of certain assets associated
with discontinued product lines and the timing of employees
leaving the company. The estimated total cost of the
restructuring and divestiture actions which commenced in
November 2004 is anticipated to be between $206 million and
$211 million.

Accounting for Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the
collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is
doubtful. The allowance is based on our historical experience,
the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
We review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $10.1 million and
$11.3 million at December 25, 2005 and
December 26, 2004, respectively. The decline is primarily
attributable to currency fluctuations.

Product Warranty Liability

Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the
repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a
specified period after the time of the sales. We estimate our
warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors
including historical trends of units sold, the status of
existing claims, recall programs and communication with
customers. Our estimated product warranty liability was
$14.2 million and $9.7 million at December 25,
2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess
uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
audits, disputes and potentially litigation, the outcome of
which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently
about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax
assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs,
future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be
necessary. Our income taxes payable was $46.2 million and
$23.3 million at December 25, 2005 and
December 26, 2004, respectively.

We are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred
tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future
taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could
be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this
assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount
of, valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the
extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments
to the valuation allowances may be required.

Results of Operations

Discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a
purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of
acquisition. Activity beyond the initial twelve months is
considered core growth. Core growth excludes the impact of
translating the results of international subsidiaries at
different currency exchange rates from year to year, the impact
of eliminating the one-month reporting lag for certain of our
foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested
companies within the most recent twelve-month period. The
following comparisons exclude the impact of certain businesses
sold or discontinued, which have been presented in our
consolidated financial results as discontinued operations as
outlined above.

Comparison of 2005 and 2004

Revenues increased 5% in 2005 to $2.51 billion from
$2.39 billion in 2004. This increase was due to increases
of 5% from core growth and 4% from acquisitions, offset, in
part, by decreases of 3% from dispositions and 1% from the
impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag in 2004 for
certain of our foreign operations. The Commercial, Medical and
Aerospace segments comprised 47%, 33% and 20% of our revenues,
respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
revenues increased to 71.8% in 2005 compared with 71.3% in 2004
due primarily to the impact of duplicate costs and
inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between
facilities in the Commercial Segment associated with the
restructuring program. Selling, engineering and administrative
expenses (operating expenses) as a percentage of revenues
declined to 17.9% in 2005 compared with 20.4% in 2004 due
primarily to the continuing reduction of facilities and
supporting infrastructure costs and decreased unallocated
corporate expenses relative to higher revenues.

Interest expense increased in 2005 principally from higher
acquisition related debt balances in the first half of 2005.
Interest income increased in 2005 primarily due to higher
average cash balances, related to increased proceeds received
from sales of businesses and assets in 2005. The effective
income tax rate was 22.99% in 2005 compared with 13.17% in 2004.
The higher rate in 2005 was primarily the result of the increase
in foreign earnings for businesses located in higher-taxed
jurisdictions. Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries
increased $1.1 million in 2005 due to increased profits
from our entities that are not wholly-owned. Net income for 2005
was $138.8 million, an increase of $129.3 million from
2004, due primarily to a 60% decrease in restructuring costs and
to the gain on the sale of the Sermatech business. Diluted
earnings per share increased $3.15 to $3.39, and includes the
net gain on sales of businesses and assets and the cost of
restructuring and discontinued operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we announced and commenced
implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program
designed to improve future operating performance and position us
for future earnings growth. The actions have included exiting or
divesting of non-core or low performing businesses,
consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing
administrative functions to enable businesses to share services.

Certain costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture
program are not included in restructuring costs. All inventory
adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture
program and certain other costs associated with closing out
businesses during 2005 and 2004 are included in materials, labor
and other product costs and totaled $2.0 million and
$17.0 million, respectively. The $2.0 million in costs
for 2005 related to our Aerospace Segment. Of the
$17.0 million in costs for 2004, $4.5 million and
$12.5 million were attributed to our Commercial and
Aerospace segments, respectively.



For 2005 and 2004, the charges, including changes in estimates,
associated with the restructuring and divestiture program by
segment that are included in restructuring costs were as follows:

Termination benefits are comprised of severance-related payments
for all employees terminated in connection with the
restructuring and divestiture program. Contract termination
costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in
conjunction with the consolidation of facilities and in 2005
also include a $0.5 million reduction in the estimated cost
associated with a lease termination in conjunction with a
consolidation of manufacturing facilities in our Commercial
Segment. Asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and
equipment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing
facilities and in 2004 also relate to goodwill associated with
our Industrial Gas Turbine aftermarket services business. Other
restructuring costs include expenses primarily related to the
consolidation of manufacturing operations and the reorganization
of administrative functions.

As of December 25, 2005, we expect to incur the following
future restructuring costs in our Medical Segment over the next
2 quarters (dollars in thousands):

Termination benefits

13,000 - 14,000

Contract termination costs

1,750 -  2,750

Other restructuring costs

$

17,500 - 22,500

Cost savings from our restructuring and divestiture program were
approximately $53 million in 2005 and we expect cost
savings for 2006 to be between $60 million and
$80 million.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Revenues increased 16% in 2004 to $2.39 billion from
$2.06 billion in 2003. This increase was due to increases
of 7% from acquisitions, 6% from core growth, 4% from currency,
1% from the consolidation of variable interest entities and 1%
from the impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag for
certain of our foreign operations, offset, in part, by a
decrease of 3% from dispositions. The Commercial, Medical and
Aerospace segments comprised 50%, 31% and 19% of our revenues,
respectively.

Materials, labor and other product costs as a percentage of
revenues decreased to 71.3% in 2004 compared to 71.7% in 2003.
The decline was due to the disposition of underperforming
businesses and a



favorable contribution from the HudsonRCI acquisition. Selling,
engineering and administrative expenses (operating expenses) as
a percentage of revenues increased to 20.4% in 2004 compared
with 18.7% in 2003 due to increases relative to sales in the
Commercial and Aerospace segments and higher corporate expenses
which were impacted by the costs of compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and costs associated with the
resolution of a number of legal matters.

In 2003, we sold an investment, resulting in a

pre-tax

gain of
$3.1 million, or $0.05 per share after tax. In 2004, we
sold six non-strategic businesses, resulting in a net

pre-tax

gain of
$2.7 million, or $0.04 per share.

Interest expense increased in 2004 principally from higher debt
outstanding in connection with the HudsonRCI acquisition, net of
repayments and lower borrowing costs. The effective income tax
rate was 13.17% in 2004 compared with 24.06% in 2003. The lower
rate in 2004 was primarily the result of the benefit associated
with the restructuring and divestiture program. Minority
interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased
$3.1 million in 2004 due to increased profits from our
entities that are not wholly-owned. Net income for 2004 was
$9.5 million, a decrease of 91% from 2003. Diluted earnings
per share decreased 91% to $0.24, and includes the cost of
restructuring and discontinued operations.

Segment Reviews

The following is a discussion of our segment operating results.
Additional information regarding our segments is presented in
Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Commercial

Products in the Commercial Segment are manufactured for broad
distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual
customer needs. Consumer spending patterns influence the market
trends for products sold to the automotive and marine markets.

Automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily
for automotive OEMs. Discussion of marine and industrial product
lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of
driver controls, motion controls, power and vehicle management
systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply,
marine and industrial markets.

Comparison of 2005 and 2004

Commercial Segment revenues declined 1% in 2005 to
$1.19 billion from $1.20 billion in 2004. The segment
generated an increase of 3% from core growth that was more than
offset by a 4% decrease from dispositions. The segment benefited
from strength in its industrial OEM markets, the contribution of
new driver controls and power and vehicle management system
products and increased sales of driver and motion controls to
automotive OEM markets. These benefits were more than offset by
slower sales of products into marine and recreational markets.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 23% in 2005 to
$81.1 million from $105.7 million in 2004. This
decline primarily reflects lower volume related contributions
from higher margin marine and recreational products, the impact
of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of
products between two Tier 2 automotive supply facilities,
the bankruptcy of an automotive supply customer and the impact
of divestitures made in 2004. Operating profit as a percent of
revenues declined to 6.8% in 2005 from 8.8% in 2004.

Assets in the Commercial Segment declined $111.1 million or
12%, primarily due to the impact of currency and business
dispositions.



Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Commercial Segment revenues increased 10% in 2004 to
$1.20 billion from $1.09 billion in 2003. The
improvement was due to increases of 8% from core growth, 4% from
currency and 3% from acquisitions, offset, in part, by a 5%
decrease from dispositions. Revenue from driver control products
sold to OEM’s increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003,
with increases from currency and core growth mostly offset by a
decrease from a disposition. For the remainder of the segment,
three-fourths of the revenue improvements were the result of
core gains. Favorable currency translation provided a majority
of the remaining increase; revenues from acquired entities were
equivalent to the impact of dispositions.

Commercial Segment operating profit declined 5% in 2004 to
$105.7 million from $111.5 million in 2003. Marine and
industrial operating profit improved on volume gains which were
partially offset by a cancellation of automotive alternative
fuel programs in North America, pricing pressure in the
automotive supplier market and costs related to a new product
launch. Operating profit in the automotive cables and shifters
product line declined as a result of pricing pressure and
increased raw material costs. Operating profit as a percent of
revenues declined to 8.8% in 2004 from 10.2% in 2003.

Assets in the Commercial Segment increased $31.1 million,
as currency and receivable increases in European automotive
cable and shifter and United States light-duty cables were
tempered by the impact of business dispositions.

Medical

Products in the Medical Segment generally are required to meet
exacting standards of performance and have long product life
cycles. Economic influences on revenues relate primarily to
spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital
supply market.

Comparison of 2005 and 2004

Medical Segment revenues increased 13% in 2005 to
$831.1 million from $736.4 million in 2004. This
increase was due to increases of 13% from acquisitions and 3%
from core growth, offset, in part, by decreases of 2% from the
impact of eliminating the one-month reporting lag in 2004 for
certain of our foreign operations and 1% from dispositions.
Medical Segment revenues increased primarily as a result of the
increased sale of disposable medical products, particularly
related to the third quarter 2004 acquisition of HudsonRCI, a
provider of respiratory care products. Sales of surgical
instruments and medical devices increased primarily as a result
of new product sales and volume increases for specialty devices
sold to medical device manufacturers.

Medical Segment operating profit increased 29% in 2005 to
$150.0 million from $116.7 million in 2004 driven
primarily by the HudsonRCI acquisition and significant
improvements in the core business as benefits of the
restructuring program began to be recognized. Operating profit
as a percent of revenues increased to 18.0% in 2005 from 15.8%
in 2004.

Assets in the Medical Segment declined $67.0 million or 6%,
primarily due to the impact of currency.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Medical Segment revenues increased 40% in 2004 to
$736.4 million from $525.8 million in 2003. This
increase was due to increases of 24% from acquisitions, 6% from
core growth, 5% from currency, 3% from the impact of eliminating
the one-month reporting lag for certain of our foreign
operations and 2% from the consolidation of variable interest
entities. In disposable medical products, 59% of the growth came
from the HudsonRCI acquisition with currency and core
improvement providing a majority of the remaining increase. In
surgical instruments and medical devices, the cardiothoracic
acquisition in the third quarter of 2003 accounted for over
two-thirds of the year-over-year revenue improvement.



Medical Segment operating profit increased 38% in 2004 to
$116.7 million from $84.7 million in 2003. This
increase was driven largely by acquisitions and core volume
gains in both the disposable medical products and surgical
instruments and medical devices product lines. Operating profit
as a percent of revenues declined to 15.8% in 2004 from 16.1% in
2003.

Assets in the Medical Segment increased $538.9 million or
95% primarily due to the HudsonRCI acquisition.

Aerospace

Products and services in the Aerospace Segment, many of which
are proprietary, require a high degree of engineering
sophistication and are often custom-designed. Economic
influences on these products and services relate primarily to
spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and to
demand for power generation.

Comparison of 2005 and 2004

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 9% in 2005 to
$493.8 million from $453.2 million in 2004. Strong
core growth in repair products and services and in sales of both
narrow-body cargo loading systems and wide-body cargo system
conversions, along with an increase due to a small acquisition
in 2005, was partially offset by the impact of eliminating the
one-month reporting lag in 2004 for certain of our foreign
operations and by the phase out of industrial gas turbine
aftermarket services.

Aerospace Segment operating profit increased to a profit of
$33.4 million in 2005 from a loss of $10.5 million in
2004, an improvement of $43.9 million. Higher volume and
improvements in precision-machined components and the cargo
systems businesses contributed to the increase as did a
reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial
gas turbine aftermarket services. Operating profit (loss) as a
percent of revenues was 6.8% in 2005 versus (2.3)% in 2004.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment declined $106.0 million or
27%, due primarily to the impact of the sale of the Sermatech
International business.

Comparison of 2004 and 2003

Aerospace Segment revenues increased 2% in 2004 to
$453.2 million from $445.6 million in 2003. This
increase was due to increases of 1% from core growth, 1% from
currency and 1% from the impact of eliminating the one-month
reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations, offset, in
part, by a 1% decrease from dispositions. Core growth was the
result of double-digit growth in repair products and services
and precision-machined components, which more than compensated
for declines in industrial gas turbine, or IGT and
cargo-handling systems. Core revenue growth was in part due to
increased sales of lower margin offerings.

Aerospace Segment operating profit declined 279% in 2004 to a
loss of $10.5 million from a profit of $5.9 million in
2003. Operating profit declined due primarily to one-time
charges in IGT related to our restructuring and divestiture
program, pricing pressures from the aerospace OEMs and
aftermarket and higher costs in manufactured components.
Operating profit (loss) as a percent of revenues was (2.3)% in
2004 versus 1.3% in 2003.

Assets in the Aerospace Segment declined $69.9 million or
15% due substantially to the phase-out of the IGT business.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$335.9 million during 2005. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2005 resulted in a net cash inflow of
$69.7 million. The most significant change was a decrease
in accounts receivable, which was primarily due to improved cash
collection practices including the sale of certain receivables
under a non-recourse securitization program. Our financing
activities during 2005 consisted primarily of a reduction in
long-term borrowings of $270.3 million and proceeds from
long-term borrowings of $109.2 million, as a result of
improved operating cash flow, the repatriation of foreign
earnings, proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower
capital spending. During 2005, we also made payments to minority
interest shareholders of $63.0 million and purchases of
treasury stock of $46.5 million. Our investing activities
during 2005 consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of
businesses and assets of $142.9 million. During 2005, we
also had capital expenditures of $69.9 million. We had net
cash used in discontinued operations of $2.7 million in
2005. See the “Interest Rate Risk” section of
Item 7A on page 30 for additional information
regarding interest rates and borrowings.

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$254.8 million during 2004. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2004 resulted in a net cash inflow of
$25.9 million. The most significant changes were an
increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease
in inventories, offset, in part, by an increase in accounts
receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable. The increase
in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to
increased accruals associated with the restructuring and
divestiture program. The decrease in inventories was the result
of our focus on improved working capital management. The
increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of
increased business levels and the HudsonRCI acquisition. The
decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions
associated with the restructuring and divestiture program, for
which the cash benefits were received in 2005. Our financing
activities during 2004 consisted primarily of the receipt of
$511.6 million in gross proceeds from long-term borrowings,
primarily for the acquisition of HudsonRCI. This amount is
offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of
$137.8 million and a reduction in long-term borrowings of
$77.9 million, driven by improved operating cash flow,
proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower
year-over-year capital spending. Our investing activities during
2004 consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of
$458.5 million. We had net cash provided by discontinued
operations of $7.4 million in 2004.

Operating activities provided net cash of approximately
$225.7 million during 2003. Changes in our operating assets
and liabilities during 2003 resulted in a net cash outflow of
$6.3 million. The most significant change was an increase
in accounts receivable, offset, in part, by an increase in
income taxes payable. Accounts receivable growth was in line
with volume improvement as accounts receivable as a percentage
of fourth quarter revenues remained flat. Our financing
activities during 2003 consisted primarily of a reduction in
long-term borrowings of $37.5 million, offset, in part, by
an increase in notes payable and current borrowings of
$35.1 million. During 2003, we also paid $30.9 million
in dividends. Our investing activities during 2003 consisted
primarily of payments for businesses acquired of
$85.2 million and capital expenditures of
$76.3 million. We had net cash used in discontinued
operations of $21.1 million in 2003.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity,
which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a
commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues notes secured by
that interest to third party investors. The assets of the
special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our
obligations.

During the first quarter of 2005, we amended the securitization
program agreement. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,” transfers of assets under the program now
qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly,
$40.1 million and $0 of accounts receivable and the related
amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from
the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2005 and
December 26, 2004, respectively.



On July 25, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $140 million of outstanding Teleflex
common stock over twelve months ending July 2006. Under the
approved plan, we repurchased 0.7 million shares on the
open market for an aggregate purchase price of
$46.5 million during 2005.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, management completed its
analysis of the impact of the AJCA and finalized and executed a
foreign earnings repatriation plan. Under this plan, we
repatriated $304 million of dividends during November and
December 2005.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
$32.6 million and $31.7 million at December 25,
2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively, relates
principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain
deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards
in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate
sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits
related to the remaining net deferred tax asset. The valuation
allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
which requires that a valuation allowance be established and
maintained when it is “more likely than not” that all
or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

In addition to the cash generated from operations, we have
approximately $383 million in committed and
$120 million in uncommitted unused lines of credit
available. The availability of the lines of credit is dependent
upon us maintaining our financial condition including our
continued compliance with bank covenants. Various senior and
term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain
financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and
payment of cash dividends. Under the most restrictive of these
provisions, $213 million of retained earnings was available
for dividends and stock repurchases at December 25, 2005.

On February 22, 2006, the Board of Directors declared a
quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on our common stock,
which was paid on March 15, 2006 to holders of record on
March 6, 2006. As of March 6, 2006, we had
approximately 1,005 holders of record of our common stock.

Fixed rate borrowings comprised 68% of total borrowings at
December 25, 2005. Approximately 22% of our total
borrowings of $631 million are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, which we
believe provides a natural hedge against fluctuations in the
value of assets outside the United States.

The following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio:

The decline in our percent of net debt to total capital for 2005
as compared to 2004 is primarily due to the receipt of proceeds
from the sale of businesses and assets and improved management
of working capital.



We believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to
access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us
to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and
additional acquisition opportunities.

    obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements.

We also have obligations with respect to our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans. See Note 12 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
on Form

10-K.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have residual value guarantees under operating leases for
plant and equipment. The maximum potential amount of future
payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is
approximately $6.9 million.

We use an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
currently structured, we sell certain trade receivables on a
non-recourse basis to a consolidated special purpose entity,
which in turn sells an interest in those receivables to a

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
    RISK

Market Risk

We are exposed to certain financial risks, specifically
fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and, to a lesser extent, commodity prices. We use
derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact
of some of these risks. All instruments are entered into for
other than trading purposes. We are also exposed to changes in
the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the
valuation of stock options and their effect on pro forma
earnings as disclosed.



Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our
borrowing activities and our cash balances. Interest rate swaps
are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The
table below is an analysis of the amortization and related
interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable
rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates shown below are
weighted average rates of the debt portfolio. For the swaps,
notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of
maturity. The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of
December 25, 2005 was $1.5 million.

A 1.0% increase or decrease in variable interest rates would
adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by
approximately $1.1 million or ($1.1 million),
respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions
in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain
subsidiaries. We have entered into forward contracts with
several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of
projected cash flows from these exposures. The following table
presents our open forward currency contracts as of
December 25, 2005, which all mature in 2006. Forward
contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the
stated currencies (in thousands). The fair value of the open
forward contracts as of December 25, 2005 was
$0.5 million.

A movement of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar against
foreign currencies would impact our expected net earnings by
approximately $0.9 million.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report are functioning effectively to
provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute
assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system
are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within a company have been detected.

(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management’s report on internal control over financial
reporting is set forth on page F-2 of this Annual Report on
Form

and is
incorporated by reference herein.

(c) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting
occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The management of Teleflex Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 25, 2005. In making this assessment, management
used the framework established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As a result of
this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework,
management has concluded that, as of December 25, 2005, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 25, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teleflex
Incorporated:

We have completed integrated audits of Teleflex
Incorporated’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
as of December 25, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Teleflex Incorporated and its
subsidiaries at December 25, 2005 and December 26,
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the years ended December 25, 2005, December 26,
2004 and December 28, 2003 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, appearing on page F-2, that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 25, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-3


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1— Summary of significant accounting
policies

Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Teleflex Incorporated and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”). Also in accordance with
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46(R),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” the
Company consolidates variable interest entities in which it
bears a majority of the risk to the potential losses or gains
from a majority of the expected returns. Intercompany
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but
not a controlling equity interest are carried on the equity
basis. Investments in affiliates over which the Company does not
have significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and include management’s estimates
and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company eliminated the
one-month lag for certain of its foreign operations to coincide
with the timing of reporting for all of the Company’s other
operations. As a result, the Company’s consolidated results
for 2004 include the results of those operations for the month
of December 2003 and the entire twelve months of 2004, whereas
the Company’s consolidated results for 2003 include the
results of those operations for the month of December 2002 and
the first eleven months of 2003 and the consolidated results for
2005 include the results of those operations for the entire
twelve months of 2005. This change increased the Company’s
consolidated revenues for 2004 by $16,879 and reduced the
Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations
before taxes and minority interest for 2004 by $1,114.

See Note 15 for a description of discontinued operations.

Use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair values:

The estimated fair value amounts presented
in these consolidated financial statements have been determined
by the Company using available market information and
appropriate methodologies. However, considerable judgment is
required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of
fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. Such fair value estimates are
based on pertinent information available to management as of
December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and have not
been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated
financial statements since such dates.

Cash and cash equivalents:

All highly liquid debt
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less
are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash
equivalents approximates their current market value.

Accounts receivable:

Accounts receivable represents
amounts due from customers related to the sale of products. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained and represents the
Company’s estimate of probable losses on realization of the
full receivable. The allowance is provided at such time that
management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
will be collected within a reasonable period of time. The
allowance is based on the Company’s historical experience,
the period an account is outstanding, the financial position of
the customer and information provided by credit rating services.
The allowance for

F-9


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

doubtful accounts was $10,090 and $11,296 as of
December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of
average cost or market. Elements of cost in inventory include
raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. In
estimating market value, the Company evaluates inventory for
excess and obsolete quantities based on estimated usage and
sales.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during
the application development stage generally are capitalized.
Costs of enhancements to internal-use computer software are
capitalized, provided that these enhancements result in
additional functionality. Other additions and those improvements
which increase the capacity or lengthen the useful lives of the
assets are also capitalized. With minor exceptions,
straight-line composite lives for depreciation of property,
plant and equipment are as follows: buildings —
30 years; machinery and equipment — 8 to
10 years. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized
but are tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment
losses, if any, are recorded as part of income from operations.
Impairment tests are performed annually, or more frequently if
there is a triggering event.

In connection with the Company’s restructuring and
divestiture program, the Company determined in the fourth
quarter of 2004 that a portion of its goodwill was impaired and
recorded a charge of $18.6 million, $14.1 million of
which was included in restructuring costs and $4.5 million
of which was included in discontinued operations. The Company
performed an annual impairment test of its remaining recorded
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
quarters of 2005 and 2004 and found no instances of impairment.

Intangible assets consisting of intellectual property, customer
lists and distribution rights are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives, which range from 4 to 30 years,
with a weighted average amortization period of 12 years.
The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the
useful lives of these assets.

Long-lived assets:

The ability to realize long-lived
assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount.
Such evaluation is based on various analyses, including
undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that
incorporate, as applicable, the impact on the existing business.
The analyses necessarily involve significant management
judgment. Any impairment loss, if indicated, is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
estimated fair value of the asset.

Product warranty liability:

Product warranty liability
arises out of the need to repair or replace product without
charge to the customer. The Company warrants such products from
manufacturing defect. The Company estimates its warranty
liability based on historical trends of units sold, the status
of existing claims, recall programs and communication with
customers.

Foreign currency translation:

Assets and liabilities of
non-domestic subsidiaries denominated in local currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange at
the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at
the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The
resultant translation adjustments are reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity.

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Derivative financial instruments:

The Company uses
derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. All instruments are entered into for
other than trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized on
the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded in earnings or other comprehensive
income (loss), based on whether the instrument is designated as
part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge
transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported
in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to
earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the
underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is
recognized in current period earnings. If the hedging
relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes
probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur,
gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in current period
earnings.

Stock-based compensation:

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” encourages,
but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The
Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly,
compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock
issued to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the date of
the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock.

The following table illustrates the pro forma net income and
earnings per share for 2005, 2004 and 2003 as if compensation
expense for stock options issued to employees had been
determined consistent with SFAS No. 123:

The fair value for options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Income taxes:

The provision for income taxes is
determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this approach,
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to
occur when the reported

F-11


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The
provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or
payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes
during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between
the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and
liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax
laws when changes are enacted. Provision has been made for
income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and
affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed
to be permanently invested.

Pensions and other postretirement benefits:

The Company
provides a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired
employees, including pensions and postretirement healthcare. The
Company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on
calculations which include various actuarial assumptions such as
discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets,
compensation increases, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend
rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an
annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends when appropriate. As required, the
effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future
periods.

Restructuring costs:

Restructuring costs, which include
termination benefits, contract termination costs, asset
impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at
estimated fair value. Key assumptions in calculating the
restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated to
exit certain contractual obligations, the realizable value of
certain assets associated with discontinued product lines and
the timing of employees leaving the company.

Revenue recognition:

The Company recognizes revenues from
product sales or services provided when the following revenue
recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. This generally occurs when
products are shipped or services rendered upon customers’
acceptance.

Revenues from product sales, net of estimated returns and other
allowances based on historical experience and current trends,
are recognized upon shipment of products to customers. Revenues
from services provided are recognized as the services are
rendered and comprised less than 10% of total revenues for all
periods presented. Revenues from longer term construction
contracts are accounted for based on the percentage of
completion method and comprised less than 2% of total revenues
for all periods presented.

Revisions and reclassifications:

The Company has revised
its consolidated statements of cash flows to attribute cash
flows from discontinued operations to each of operating,
financing and investing activities. Previously, the Company
reported cash flows from discontinued operations as one line
item. The Company has also revised its consolidated statements
of cash flows to attribute payments to minority interest
shareholders as cash flows from financing activities of
continuing operations. Previously, the Company reported these
cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities of
continuing operations. In addition, certain reclassifications
have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial
statements to conform to current year presentation. Certain
financial information is presented on a rounded basis, which may
cause minor differences.

Note 2—New accounting standards

Medicare prescription drug costs:

On December 8,
2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”) was signed into
law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors
of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that
is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The
Company sponsors medical programs for certain of its
U.S. retirees. In April 2004, the FASB issued Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 106-2 to address
the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Act.
FSP No. FAS 106-2 is effective for

F-12


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2004.
The Company adopted this provision during 2004 and it did not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. On January 21, 2005,
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
released the final regulations (the “Regulations”)
implementing the Act. Generally, the Regulations are expected to
cause more retiree health programs (or subgroups within such
programs) to meet the Act’s actuarial equivalence standard
(or to result in more years of expected actuarial equivalence)
than had originally been expected when the Act was passed. The
Regulations did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

American Jobs Creation Act:

On October 22, 2004 the
American Jobs Creation Act (“the AJCA”) was signed
into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain
foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA.
The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and
complexities, and during the past nine months, the Company has
been analyzing the previous guidance provided by the Treasury
Department and the potential impact of applying the repatriation
provision to unremitted foreign earnings held by its various
controlled foreign corporations. During the three months ended
December 25, 2005, management completed its analysis of the
impact of the AJCA and finalized and executed a repatriation
plan. Under this plan, the Company repatriated $304 million
of dividends during November and December 2005. Accordingly, the
Company recorded a tax expense of approximately
$8.3 million during the three months ended
December 25, 2005 as a result of this repatriation. This
tax expense was offset by a tax benefit of approximately
$14.1 million related to excess foreign tax credits
generated in connection with this repatriation. Management
obtained the requisite corporate officer and Board of Directors
approvals of the domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe
specified. See Note 11 for additional information regarding
income taxes.

Inventory costs:

In November 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which clarifies the types
of costs that should be expensed rather than capitalized as
inventory. This statement also clarifies the circumstances under
which fixed overhead costs associated with operating facilities
involved in inventory processing should be capitalized. The
provisions of SFAS No. 151 are effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt
this standard on December 26, 2005 and does not expect the
provisions of this statement to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Stock-based compensation:

In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment,” which establishes accounting standards for
transactions in which an entity receives employee services in
exchange for (a) equity instruments of the entity or
(b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
entity’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of equity instruments. SFAS No. 123(R)
requires an entity to recognize the grant-date fair value of
stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to
employees in the statement of income. The statement also
requires that such transactions be accounted for using the
fair-value-based method, thereby eliminating use of the
intrinsic value method of accounting in APB No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” which was
permitted under Statement 123, as originally issued.
SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company intends to adopt
this statement on December 26, 2005 using modified
prospective application and previously reported operating
results will remain unchanged. The Company expects the
provisions of this statement to have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations and the Company believes
that the pro forma disclosures in Note 1 provide a
preliminary short-term indicator of the level of expense that
will be recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R).
However, the total expense recorded in future periods will
depend on several factors, including future grants, the number
of share-based awards that vest and the fair value of those
vested awards.

F-13


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Exchanges of nonmonetary assets:

In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion
No. 29.” The guidance in APB Opinion No. 29,
“Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” is based on
the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be
measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged. The
guidance in that Opinion, however, included certain exceptions
to that principle. This statement amends Opinion No. 29 to
eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets that do not have commercial substance. A
nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash
flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of
this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and it did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Conditional asset retirement obligations:

In March 2005,
the FASB issued FIN No. 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” which clarifies
that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset
retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be
reasonably estimated. The provisions of FIN No. 47 are
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005.
The Company adopted the provisions of this interpretation in the
fourth quarter of 2005 and it did not have a material impact on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Accounting changes and error corrections:

In May 2005,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections.” SFAS No. 154 replaces APB
Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and
SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements” and changes the requirements
of the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 also provides guidance on the
accounting for and reporting of error corrections. The
provisions of this statement are applicable for accounting
changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this
standard on December 26, 2005 and does not expect the
provisions of this statement to have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash

Amortization period for leasehold improvements:

In June
2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached
a consensus on Issue No. 05-6, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements,” which
requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business
combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease
be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or
a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the
date of the business combination or purchase. EITF No. 05-6
is effective for periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The
Company adopted the provisions of this consensus in the fourth
quarter of 2005 and it did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Note 3—Acquisitions

2005 Acquisition

In 2005, the Company acquired a small repair products and
services business in the Aerospace Segment for $8,000. Based on
the preliminary purchase price allocation, no goodwill was
recognized in the transaction.

Acquisition of Hudson Respiratory Care, Inc.

On July 6, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Hudson
Respiratory Care Inc. (“HudsonRCI”), a provider of
disposable medical products for respira-

tory care and anesthesia, for $457,499. The results for
HudsonRCI are included in the Company’s Medical Segment.

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” The following table presents
the allocation of purchase price for the HudsonRCI acquisition
based on estimated fair values:

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefit
the Company expects to realize from expanding its presence in
the healthcare supply market through HudsonRCI and from expected
synergies. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Of the
$103,300 in intangible assets, $40,900 was assigned to customer
relationships with estimated remaining amortizable lives of
10 years and $900 was assigned to patents with estimated
remaining amortizable lives of 11.5 years. The remaining
$61,500 was assigned to trade names with indefinite useful
lives. The deferred tax asset is a result of HudsonRCI’s
net operating loss carryforward and a difference in tax basis
prior to acquisition.

The following table provides unaudited pro forma results of
operations for the periods noted below, as if the acquisition
had been made at the beginning of each period. The pro forma
amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that would
have occurred if the acquisition had been completed at that time.

In connection with this acquisition, the Company formulated a
plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity.
The Company finalized the integration plan during the second
quarter of 2005 and the integration activities are ongoing as of
December 25, 2005. The Company has accrued estimates for
certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and
facility closings and the termination of certain distribution
agreements at the date of acquisition, in accordance with EITF
Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” Set forth

2003 Acquisitions

In 2003, the Company acquired seven smaller businesses for a
total cost of $95,481, of which $94,995 was paid in cash in 2003
and $486 was paid in cash in 2005. The acquisitions included a
cardiothoracic devices business and an anesthesia and
respiratory care business in the Medical Segment; a designer and
manufacturer of electronic and electromechanical products for
the automotive, marine and industrial markets, a European
manufacturer of alternative fuel systems, a passenger and light
truck electronic throttle control business, a European
light-duty cable operation, and an automotive seat comfort
systems business in the Commercial Segment. Goodwill recognized
in those transactions amounted to $26,649, of which $1,780 was
deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was assigned to the
Commercial and Medical segments in the amount of $25,586 and
$1,063, respectively.

Note 4—Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced and
commenced implementation of a restructuring and divestiture
program designed to improve future operating performance and
position the Company for future earnings growth. The actions
have included exiting or divesting of non-core or low performing
businesses, consolidating manufacturing operations and
reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to
share services.

Certain costs associated with the restructuring and divestiture
program are not included in restructuring costs. All inventory
adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture
program and certain other costs associated with closing out
businesses during 2005 and 2004 are included in materials, labor
and other product costs and totaled $2,000 and $17,040,
respectively. The $2,000 in costs for 2005 related to the
Company’s Aerospace Segment. Of the $17,040 in costs for
2004, $4,537 and $12,503 were attributed to the Company’s
Commercial and Aerospace segments, respectively.

costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in
conjunction with the consolidation of facilities and in 2005
also include a $531 reduction in the estimated cost associated
with a lease termination in conjunction with the consolidation
of manufacturing facilities in the Company’s Commercial
Segment. Asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and
equipment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing
facilities and in 2004 also relate to goodwill associated with
the Company’s Industrial Gas Turbine aftermarket services
business. Other restructuring costs include expenses primarily
related to the consolidation of manufacturing operations and the

Note 10—Shareholders’ equity and stock
compensation plans

The authorized capital of the Company is comprised of
100,000,000 common shares, $1 par value, and 500,000
preference shares. No preference shares have been outstanding
during the last three years.

On July 25, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $140 million of
outstanding Teleflex common stock over twelve months ending July
2006. Under the approved plan, the Company repurchased (in
thousands) 690 shares on the open market for an aggregate
purchase price of $46,518 during 2005.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same
manner except that the weighted average number of shares is
increased for dilutive securities. The difference between basic
and diluted weighted average common shares results from the
assumption that dilutive stock options were exercised. A
reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares
outstanding is as follows:

TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Significant components of the deferred tax assets and
liabilities at year end were as follows:

At December 25, 2005, the cumulative unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries outside the United States, for which no income or
withholding taxes have been provided, approximated $229,304.
Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely and as
a result, no deferred tax liability has been recognized with
regard to the remittance of such earnings. It is not practicable
to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if
such earnings were remitted to the United States.

Under the tax laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company
operates, deductions or credits that cannot be fully utilized
for tax purposes during the current year may be carried forward,
subject to statutory limitations, to reduce taxable income or
taxes payable in a future tax year. At December 25, 2005,
the tax effect of such carry forwards approximated $94,592. Of
this amount, $11,640 has no expiration date, $6,682 expires
after 2005 but before the end of 2010 and $76,270 expires after
2010. A substantial amount of these loss carryforwards were
acquired in an acquisition by the Company in 2004. Therefore,
the utilization of these tax attributes is subject to an annual
limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. It is not expected that this annual limitation will
prevent the Company from utilizing its carryforwards. The
determination of state net operating loss carryforwards are
dependent upon the U.S. subsidiaries’ taxable income
or loss, apportionment percentages and other respective state
laws, which can change year to year and impact the amount of
such carryforward.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $32,598 and
$31,689 at December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004,
respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the
utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss
and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The valuation
allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 109, which requires that a valuation allowance be
established and maintained when it is “more likely than
not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not
be realized.

The defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. The
benefits under these plans are based primarily on years of

plans are
systematically provided for by depositing funds with trustees or
by book reserves.

The discount rate is established from the 15+ year Merrill Lynch
AAA/ AA Bond Index as published by Bloomberg.com. The yield from
this index is 5.73% as of December 25, 2005. To satisfy the
Company that this index is representative of the obligations of
the plan, the Company also compared the projection of expected
benefit payments based on the assumptions used for the actuarial
valuation to a curve published monthly by Citigroup. Under this
analysis, the expected benefit payments are discounted by each
corresponding discount rate on the yield curve. Once the present
value of the string of benefit payments is established, the
Company solves for the single spot rate to apply to all
obligations of the plan that will exactly match the previously
determined present value. By comparing the results of the yield
curve examination to the Merrill Lynch index yield referenced
above, the Company is satisfied that 5.75% is a reasonable
assumption for the discount rate as of December 25, 2005.

The yield curve which the Company considered is the Citigroup
Pension Discount Curve, which is constructed beginning with a
U.S. Treasury par curve that reflects the entire Treasury
and Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal
Securities (“STRIPS”) market. From the Treasury curve,
Citibank produces a AA corporate par curve by adding
option-adjusted spreads that are drawn from the AA corporate
sector of the Citigroup Broad Investment—Grade Bond Index.
Finally, from the AA corporate par curve, Citigroup derives the
spot rates that constitute the Pension Discount Curve. For
payments beyond 30 years the Company extends the curve
assuming that the discount rate derived in year 30 is extended
to the end of the plan’s payment expectations. This curve
provides a conservative result and is only used to determine the
reasonableness of the Company’s assumption.

The parent Company and certain subsidiaries provide medical,
dental and life insurance benefits to pensioners and survivors.
The associated plans are unfunded and approved claims are paid
from Company funds.

Increasing the assumed healthcare trend rate by 1% would
increase the benefit obligation by $2,061 and would increase the
2005 benefit expense by $149. Decreasing the trend rate by 1%
would decrease the benefit obligation by $1,766 and would
decrease the 2005 benefit expense by $124.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and foreign
defined benefit pension plans was $193,536 and $186,302 for 2005
and 2004, respectively.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
obligation, and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and foreign
plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan
assets were $205,457, $192,039 and $141,804, respectively for
2005 and $197,845, $184,514 and $129,441, respectively for 2004.

Plan assets are allocated among various categories of equities,
fixed income, cash and cash equivalents with professional
investment managers whose performance is actively monitored. The
target allocation among plan assets allows for variances based
on economic and market trends. The primary investment objective
is long-term growth of assets in order to meet present and
future benefit obligations. The Company periodically conducts an
asset/liability modeling study to ensure the investment strategy
is aligned with the profile of benefit obligations.

The Company’s contributions to U.S. and foreign pension
plans during 2006 are expected to be in the range of
$7 million to $9 million. Contributions to
postretirement healthcare plans during 2006 are expected to be
approximately $2 million. Based upon the Company’s
evaluation of its cash and debt positions during 2006, the
Company may elect to contribute up to approximately
$59 million to its U.S. defined benefit plans, which
approximates the maximum allowable under current tax laws.

The Company partially matches employee contributions. Costs
related to these plans were $8,914, $9,952 and $7,445 for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Note 13—Commitments and contingent liabilities

Product warranty liability:

The Company warrants to the
original purchaser of certain of its products that it will, at
its option, repair or replace, without charge, such products if
they fail due to a manufacturing defect. Warranty periods vary
by product. The Company has recourse provisions for certain
products that would enable recovery from third parties for
amounts paid under the warranty. The Company accrues for product
warranties when, based on available information, it is probable
that customers will make claims under warranties relating to
products that have been sold, and a reasonable estimate of the
costs (based on historical claims experience relative to sales)
can be made. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the
Company’s estimated product warranty liability for 2005:

Operating leases:

The Company uses various leased
facilities and equipment in its operations. The terms for these
leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. The Company
also has synthetic lease programs that are used primarily for
plant and equipment. In connection with the synthetic and other
leases, the Company has residual value guarantees in the amount
of $6,859 at December 25, 2005. The Company’s future
payments cannot exceed the minimum rent obligation plus the
residual value guarantee amount. The guarantee amounts are tied
to the unamortized lease values of the assets under synthetic
lease, and are due should the Company decide neither to renew
these leases, nor to exercise its purchase option. At
December 25, 2005, the Company had no liabilities recorded
for these obligations. Any residual value guarantee amounts paid
to the lessor may be recovered by the Company from the sale of
the assets to a third party.

Rental expense under operating leases was $36,734, $40,827 and

Accounts receivable securitization program:

The Company
uses an accounts receivable securitization program to gain
access to enhanced credit markets and reduce financing costs. As
currently structured, the Company sells certain trade
receivables on a non-recourse basis to a consolidated special
purpose entity, which in turn sells an interest in those
receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The conduit issues
notes secured by that interest to third party investors. The
assets of the special purpose entity are not available to
satisfy the obligations of the Company.

During the three months ended March 27, 2005, the Company
amended the securitization program agreement. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities,” transfers of assets under the program now
qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly, $40,068 and $0
of accounts receivable and the related amounts previously
recorded in notes payable were removed from the consolidated
balance sheet as of December 25, 2005 and December 26,
2004, respectively.

Environmental:

The Company is subject to contingencies
pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the
future may require the Company to take further action to correct
the effects on the environment of prior disposal practices or
releases of chemical or petroleum substances by the Company or
other parties. Much of this liability results from the
U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (“CERCLA”), often referred to as
Superfund, the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(“RCRA”) and similar state laws. These laws require
the Company to undertake certain investigative and remedial
activities at sites where the Company conducts or once conducted
operations or at sites where Company-generated waste was
disposed.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost
from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs,
depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving
remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and
enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of
potentially responsible parties. At December 25, 2005, the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet included an accrued
liability of $6,317 relating to these matters. Considerable
uncertainty exists with respect to these costs and, under
adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed
the amount accrued as of December 25, 2005. The time-frame
over which the accrued or presently unrecognized amounts may be
paid out, based on past history, is estimated to be
15-20 years.

Litigation:

The Company is a party to various lawsuits
and claims arising in the normal course of business. These
lawsuits and claims include actions involving product liability,
intellectual property, employment and environmental matters.
Based on information currently available, advice of counsel,
established reserves and other resources, the Company does not
believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or
in the aggregate, material to its business, financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity. However, in

F-29


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible
that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar
matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the
Company’s business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel
fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

In February 2004, a jury verdict of $34,800 was rendered against
one of the Company’s subsidiaries in a trademark
infringement action. In February 2005, the trial judge entered
an order rejecting the jury award in its entirety. Both parties
have filed notice to appeal on various grounds. While the
Company cannot predict the outcome of the appeals, it will
continue to vigorously contest this litigation. No accrual has
been recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Other:

The Company has various purchase commitments for
materials, supplies and items of permanent investment incident
to the ordinary conduct of business. In the aggregate, such
commitments are not at prices in excess of current market.

Note 14—Business segments and other information

The Company has determined that its reportable segments are
Commercial, Medical and Aerospace.

The Commercial Segment businesses principally design,
manufacture and distribute engineered products in the technical
areas of driver control, motion control, power and vehicle
management and fluid management. The Company’s products are
used by a wide range of markets including the passenger car and
light truck, marine, recreational, mobile power equipment,
military, agricultural and construction vehicle, truck and bus
and various other industrial equipment sectors.

The Medical Segment businesses develop, manufacture and
distribute disposable medical products, surgical instruments and
medical devices, and specialty devices that support healthcare
providers and medical equipment manufacturers. The
Company’s products are largely sold and distributed to
hospitals and healthcare providers in a range of clinical
settings.

The Aerospace Segment businesses develop and provide repair
products and services for flight and ground-based turbine
engines, manufacture and distribute precision-machined
components and design, manufacture and market cargo-handling
systems to commercial aviation, military, power generation and
industrial markets worldwide.

Information about continuing operations in different geographic
areas is as follows:

Note 15—Discontinued operations and assets held for
sale

In August 2005, the Company completed the sale of its automotive
pedal systems business and received $7,500 in gross proceeds.
The Company recognized a $20,874 reduction in the carrying value
of this business to the estimated fair value of the business
less costs to sell and recognized a loss on the sale of $1,686
in 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold a
European medical product sterilization business that was
classified as held for sale during the second quarter of 2005
and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $2,122 in 2005.
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company adopted a plan to
sell a small medical business. The Company is actively marketing
this business and recognized a loss of $4,560 in 2005 based upon
the excess of the carrying value of the business as compared to
the estimated fair value of the business less costs to sell. The
charge is included in operating income (loss) from discontinued
operations. On February 28, 2005, the Company completed the
sale of Sermatech International, a surface-engineering/
specialty coatings business. The Company received gross proceeds
of $79,868 and recorded a net gain on the sale of $34,415 in
2005. For financial statement purposes, the assets, liabilities,
results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have
been segregated from those of continuing operations and are
presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements as discontinued operations and assets and liabilities
held for sale.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a loss
of $50,531 based upon a write-down of the automotive pedal
systems business from its carrying value to the estimated fair
value of the business less costs to sell. $44,466 of the
write-down applied to long-lived assets, consisting primarily of
machinery and equipment. The charge is included in operating
income (loss) from discontinued operations.

F-32


TELEFLEX INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS—(Concluded)

Revenues of discontinued operations were $112,515, $227,967 and
$221,539 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating income
(loss) from discontinued operations was $2,304, $(68,262) and
$(5,771) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As part of the Company’s previously announced restructuring
and divestiture program, the Company determined that assets
totaling $32,789 met the criteria for held for sale
classification during 2005. The assets are comprised primarily
of land and buildings that are no longer being used in the
Company’s operations. The Company determined that the
carrying value of each asset held for sale did not exceed the
estimated fair value of the asset less costs to sell and
therefore did not adjust the carrying value of the asset in 2005.

In October 2005, the Company completed the sale of a product
line in its Medical Segment. The Company received gross proceeds
of $10,265 and recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $8,989.
Also during 2005, the Company sold assets, including assets held
for sale totaling $12,942, and recognized an aggregate net gain
on these sales of $5,234. The Company is actively marketing its
remaining assets held for sale.

During 2004, the Company sold six non-strategic businesses
resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $2,733. No individual
transaction resulted in a material gain or loss.

During 2003, the Company sold an investment resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $3,068.

Assets and liabilities held for sale are comprised of the
following:
